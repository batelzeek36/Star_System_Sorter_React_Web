# ✅ Dossier Version Comparison Ready!

## What's Been Done

You now have a **live toggle button** on the Dossier screen that lets you switch between the old and new designs instantly!

## How to Test It

1. **Make sure the dev server is running**
   ```bash
   cd star-system-sorter
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Dossier screen**
   - Go through the flow: Onboarding → Input → Result → Dossier
   - Or visit `http://localhost:5173/dossier` directly (if you have data)

3. **Look for the controls**
   - **Top-left**: Version indicator badge (✨ New Design or 📋 Original Design)
   - **Top-right**: Toggle button (🔄 Switch to Old/New Design)

4. **Click the toggle button**
   - The screen will instantly switch between versions
   - All data remains the same
   - You can toggle back and forth as many times as you want

## Next Steps

3. **Decide which version** you prefer
4. **Let me know** and I can:
   - Remove the toggle and ship your chosen version
   - Make adjustments to either version
   - Merge to main branch

## Quick Reference

### Toggle Button Location
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📋 Original Design    🔄 Switch to New  │ ← Top bar
│                                         │
│                                         │
│         Dossier Content Here            │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Keyboard Shortcut (Future)
Currently no keyboard shortcut, but we could add one (e.g., press 'V' to toggle).

## Troubleshooting

### Toggle button not visible?
- Check that you're on the `/dossier` route
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page

### Versions look the same?
- Make sure you clicked the toggle button
- Check the version indicator badge (top-left)
- Try toggling multiple times

### Data not showing?
- Make sure you have classification data
- Go through the input flow first
- Check that `useBirthDataStore` has data

## Questions?

Feel free to ask:
- "Can you adjust the toggle button position?"
- "Can you add a keyboard shortcut?"
- "Can you make the old version the default?"
- "Can you add more comparison features?"
- "I've decided on [version], can you finalize it?"

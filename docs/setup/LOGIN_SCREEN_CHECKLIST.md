- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ Zero linting errors
- ✅ 100% test pass rate
- ✅ Build time < 30 seconds
- ✅ Bundle size optimized

### User Experience
- ✅ Page load < 2 seconds
- ✅ Smooth animations

## 📝 Notes

### Current State
- Google OAuth is a **placeholder** - clicking navigates to onboarding
- Guest access is **fully functional** - navigates to onboarding
- All UI elements are **production-ready**
- Tests cover **all critical paths**

### Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
- Implement actual Google OAuth flow
- Add Apple Sign In
- Add email/password authentication
- Add session management
- Add user profile persistence

### Known Limitations
- OAuth integration pending (Phase 2)

- No user profile storage
- No "remember me" functionality

These are **intentional** for MVP and will be addressed in Phase 2.

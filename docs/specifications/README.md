# Specifications - DEPRECATED

**⚠️ Files in `_ARCHIVED_PRE_V4.2/` use outdated pre-v4.2 terminology.**

## What Changed in v4.2

The v4.2 model separates two independent concepts:
- **`role`**: Ranking/priority (`"primary"` = 1st place, `"secondary"` = 2nd place by weight)
- **`polarity`**: Behavioral quality (`"core"` = healthy, `"shadow"` = distorted)

Old docs used `alignment_type` which conflated these concepts.

## Current Documentation

See `.kiro/specs/gate-hexagram-scoring-v2/` for current v4.2 specifications.

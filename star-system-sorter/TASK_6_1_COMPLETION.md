- Displays lore version number
- Uses Figma Card (emphasis variant) for visual prominence
- Gold variant for top system, lavender for others
- Fully typed with TypeScript

**Props:**
- `classification: ClassificationResult` - The classification result to display

### Test Coverage: `src/components/lore/SystemSummary.test.tsx`

**7 tests covering:**
1. ✅ Renders classification title and lore version
2. ✅ Displays top 3 systems with percentages
3. ✅ Shows hybrid indicator for hybrid classification
4. ✅ Does not show hybrid indicator for primary classification
5. ✅ Uses gold variant for top system and lavender for others
6. ✅ Handles missing lore_version gracefully

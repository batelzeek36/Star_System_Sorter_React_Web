# Task 8.2 - Tab Navigation Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented tabbed navigation for star systems in the Why screen, allowing users to switch between Primary and Ally systems to view their respective contributors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Tab Component Implementation
- Added tab buttons for each available star system (Primary + Allies)
- Tabs display:
  - System name
  - Percentage alignment
  - "Primary" badge for the primary system
- Tabs are only shown when there are multiple systems (Primary + at least one Ally)

### 2. State Management
- Added `activeSystem` state (defaults to primary system)
- Implemented `setActiveSystem` handler to switch between systems
- Contributors and percentages update dynamically based on active tab

### 3. UI/UX Features
- **Active State**: Active tab has lavender background with shadow
- **Inactive State**: Subtle background with hover effect
- **Accessibility**: 
  - 44px minimum touch target
  - Keyboard accessible with focus ring
  - aria-label for screen readers
  - aria-current for active tab
- **Responsive**: Horizontal scroll for many systems

### 4. Dynamic Content Updates
- Section title changes based on active system:
  - Primary: "Deterministic sort contributors"
  - Allies: "Contributors for {System}"
- Total alignment displays active system's percentage
- Contributors list updates to show active system's contributors

## Technical Details

### Key Variables
```typescript
const activeSystem = useState(primarySystem);  // Current tab
const contributorsWithWeights = classification.contributorsWithWeights?.[activeSystem] || [];
const activePercentage = classification.percentages[activeSystem] || 0;
```

### Tab Component Structure
```typescript
{availableSystems.map((system) => (
  <button
    key={system}
    onClick={() => setActiveSystem(system)}
    className={isActive ? 'active-styles' : 'inactive-styles'}
  >
    {system} - {percentage}%
  </button>
))}
```

## Requirements Met
✅ Tabs for Primary and Ally systems  
✅ Default active tab is Primary  
✅ Contributors update when tab changes  
✅ Percentage displays for each system  
✅ Accessible (keyboard, screen readers, touch targets)  
✅ Responsive (horizontal scroll)

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Pass
- No TypeScript errors
- All variables properly used
- State management working correctly

## Next Steps
Task 8.3: Integrate filters from UI store (hideDisputed, minConfidence)

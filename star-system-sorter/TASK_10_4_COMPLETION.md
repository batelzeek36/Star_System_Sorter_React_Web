# Task 10.4 Complete: Print-Specific CSS

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive print-specific CSS styles for the Dossier screen to ensure professional, printer-friendly output when users print or save as PDF.

## Changes Made

### 1. Print Media Query Styles (src/index.css)
Added comprehensive `@media print` rules that include:

#### Page Setup
- Set page margins to 0.5 inches
- Configured for letter-size portrait orientation

#### Animations & Transitions
- Disabled all animations and transitions
- Set animation and transition durations to 0
- Ensures no motion in printed output

#### Text & Contrast
- Changed background to white
- Changed text to black for maximum readability
- Enabled print color adjustment for backgrounds and borders

#### Non-Printable Elements
- Hide elements with `.no-print` class (buttons, nav, etc.)
- Hide decorative elements (starfield, glows, blur effects)
- Keep elements with `.print-keep` class if needed

#### Page Break Controls
- Added `.print-no-break` class to prevent breaks inside elements
- Configured automatic page breaks for major sections (h1, h2)
- Prevented page breaks inside:
  - Tables and table rows
  - Sections and articles
  - Cards and containers
  - Code blocks and figures

#### Print Optimization
- Removed all box shadows and text shadows
- Converted gradients to solid white backgrounds
- Made links show their URLs (for external links)
- Ensured images fit within page width
- Added visible borders to tables
- Improved spacing between sections

### 2. DossierScreen Component Updates (src/screens/DossierScreen.tsx)
Added print-specific classes to key elements:

#### Hidden in Print (`.no-print`)
- Export buttons (PNG, Print/PDF)
- Starfield background component
- Cosmic glow effect overlay

#### Page Break Prevention (`.print-no-break`)
- Identity Snapshot section
- The Verdict section
- Deployment Matrix section
- Why Not section
- Gate→Faction Grid section
- Sources Gallery section

#### Text Contrast (Tailwind print variants)
- `print:text-black` on all section headers
- `print:bg-white` on main container
- `print:text-gray-700` for secondary text

### 3. Documentation
Created `PRINT_STYLES_TEST.md` with:
- Detailed testing instructions
- Expected results for print vs. PNG export
- CSS class reference guide
- Requirements checklist

## Requirements Met

✅ **10.4.1**: Print-specific CSS with `@media print` rules  
✅ **10.4.2**: Animations and transitions disabled in print  
✅ **10.4.3**: Text contrast improved (black on white)  
✅ **10.4.4**: Page-break controls added (`.print-no-break` class)  
✅ **10.4.5**: Page-break hints for sections (automatic for h1, h2)  
✅ **10.4.6**: Non-printable elements hidden (`.no-print` class)  

## Testing

### TypeScript Compilation
```bash
npm run typecheck
# ✅ Passes with no errors
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ Builds successfully
```

### Manual Testing Required
To fully verify the print styles:
1. Start dev server and navigate to Dossier screen
2. Open print preview (Cmd+P / Ctrl+P)
3. Verify:
   - Export buttons are hidden
   - Starfield/glows are hidden
   - Text is black on white
   - Sections don't break awkwardly
   - No animations visible

## Technical Details

### CSS Specificity
- Used `!important` where necessary to override component styles
- Leveraged Tailwind's `print:` variant for component-level control
- Created reusable `.no-print` and `.print-no-break` utility classes

### Browser Compatibility
The print styles use standard CSS features supported by all modern browsers:
- `@media print` (universal support)
- `page-break-inside` and `break-inside` (for older and newer browsers)
- `-webkit-print-color-adjust` and `print-color-adjust` (for backgrounds)

### Performance
- Print styles only apply when printing (no impact on screen rendering)
- No additional JavaScript required
- Minimal CSS overhead (~150 lines)

## Files Modified
1. `star-system-sorter/src/index.css` - Added print media query
2. `star-system-sorter/src/screens/DossierScreen.tsx` - Added print classes

## Files Created
1. `star-system-sorter/PRINT_STYLES_TEST.md` - Testing documentation
2. `star-system-sorter/TASK_10_4_COMPLETION.md` - This file

## Next Steps
The next task in the spec is:
- **Task 11**: Add "Open Dossier" button to Result screen

## Notes
- Print styles are designed to be printer-friendly and save ink
- All decorative elements are removed for cleaner output
- Text is optimized for readability on paper
- Page breaks are controlled to keep related content together
- PNG export preserves all visual effects (not affected by print styles)

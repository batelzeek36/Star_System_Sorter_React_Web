# Print Styles Test - Task 10.4

## Overview
This document describes how to manually test the print styles added for the Dossier screen.

## Changes Made

### 1. Print-Specific CSS (src/index.css)
Added comprehensive `@media print` styles that:
- **Remove animations and transitions**: All animations and transitions are disabled for print
- **Improve text contrast**: Text colors are set to black for better readability
- **Add page-break controls**: 
  - `print-no-break` class prevents page breaks inside elements
  - Automatic page breaks before major sections (h1, h2)
  - Tables and their rows are kept together
- **Hide non-printable elements**: Elements with `no-print` class are hidden
- **Remove decorative elements**: Starfield, glows, gradients are hidden
- **Optimize for print**: Backgrounds, shadows, and effects are removed

### 2. DossierScreen Component Updates
Added print-specific classes to:
- **Export buttons**: Hidden in print (`.no-print`)
- **Starfield background**: Hidden in print (`.no-print`)
- **Cosmic glow effect**: Hidden in print (`.no-print`)
- **Section headers**: Black text in print (`print:text-black`)
- **All major sections**: Added `print-no-break` class to prevent page breaks:
  - Identity Snapshot
  - The Verdict
  - Gate→Faction Grid
  - Deployment Matrix
  - Why Not section
  - Sources Gallery

### 3. Print-Specific Tailwind Classes
Used Tailwind's print variant for:
- `print:text-black` - Makes text black for better readability
- `print:bg-white` - Makes backgrounds white
- `print:text-gray-700` - Makes secondary text gray for contrast

## Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: Print Preview
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`

4. Verify in print preview:
   - ✅ Export buttons are hidden
   - ✅ Starfield background is hidden
   - ✅ Cosmic glow effects are hidden
   - ✅ Text is black and readable
   - ✅ Sections don't break awkwardly across pages
   - ✅ No animations or transitions visible

### Test 2: PDF Export

# Task 9.3 Completion: One-Line Verdict Section

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the One-Line Verdict section for the Dossier screen. This section displays the classification result with the star system description from the lore bundle.

## Changes Made

### File Modified
- `star-system-sorter/src/screens/DossierScreen.tsx`

### Implementation Details

1. **Imported lore bundle** to access system descriptions
2. **Added One-Line Verdict section** with emphasis Card styling
3. **Implemented conditional rendering** for:
   - **Primary classification**: Shows system name + description
   - **Hybrid classification**: Shows both systems with their descriptions

### Key Features

- **Emphasis Card styling**: Uses `bg-[var(--s3-surface-emphasis)]` and `border-[var(--s3-border-emphasis)]` for visual prominence
- **Dynamic content**: Pulls system descriptions from lore bundle
- **Proper formatting**: 
  - Primary: "Pleiades — Nurturers, artists, empaths; joy, sensuality, community weaving"
  - Hybrid: "Hybrid: Pleiades + Sirius — [descriptions with + separator]"

## Requirements Met

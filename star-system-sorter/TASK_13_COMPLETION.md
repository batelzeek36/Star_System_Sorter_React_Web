## Additional Work

### Dependencies Installed
- `lucide-react` - Required by Figma components for icons

### Test Files Created
- `test-css-variables.html` - Comprehensive visual test of all CSS variables
- Demonstrates all color scales, typography, spacing, and elevation

## Notes

- Figma components are located in `/Figma/components/s3/` directory
- Components can be imported using relative paths: `../../../Figma/components/s3/Button`
- All design tokens follow the `--s3-*` naming convention
- Legacy tokens (--background, --foreground, etc.) are also available for compatibility
- Tailwind CSS v4 is being used with the new `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax

## Next Steps

The following tasks can now proceed with full access to Figma components and design tokens:
- Task 8: Implement OnboardingScreen
- Task 9: Implement InputScreen  
- Task 10: Implement ResultScreen
- Task 11: Implement WhyScreen
- Task 14: Implement loading and error states
- Task 15: Add accessibility features

All screens can now use the Figma components (Button, Card, Chip, Field, StarSystemCrests, Toast) with proper styling from the design tokens.

# Task 16.2: Reduced Motion Support - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive reduced motion support to respect user accessibility preferences and ensure no animations flash more than 3 times per second.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced CSS Media Query
**File:** `src/index.css`

Added comprehensive `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rule that:
- Sets all animations to 0.01ms duration (effectively instant)
- Limits animation iterations to 1
- Sets all transitions to 0.01ms duration
- Disables smooth scrolling
- Specifically disables `.animate-spin` class
- Targets all animation and transition classes

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }

  /* Disable specific animations that could be problematic */
  .animate-spin {
    animation: none !important;
  }

  /* Ensure no flashing animations (>3 Hz = >3 times per second) */
  [class*="animate-"],
  [class*="transition-"] {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

### 2. Components Affected
The following components have transitions/animations that are now properly handled:

**Lore Components:**
- `ContributionCard`: Progress bar transition (duration-300)
- `SourceBadge`: Badge hover transition
- `FilterControls`: Slider thumb transitions
- `EvidenceMatrix`: Row hover transitions and slider thumbs

**Figma Components:**
- `Button`: Hover/active transitions (duration-200)
- `Field`: Focus transitions (duration-200)
- `Chip`: Hover/active transitions
- `Toast`: Slide-in/fade transitions (duration-300)
- `AppBar`: Button hover transitions
- `LoadingOverlay`: Spinner animation (animate-spin)

### 3. Flash Rate Compliance
**Requirement:** No animations flash more than 3 times per second (3 Hz)

**Analysis:**
- `transition-all duration-200`: 5 Hz frequency, but smooth transitions (not flashing)
- `transition-all duration-300`: 3.33 Hz frequency, but smooth transitions (not flashing)
- `animate-spin`: Continuous rotation (not flashing)
- All transitions are smooth interpolations, not discrete flashes
- With reduced motion enabled, all animations are effectively instant (0.01ms)

**Result:** ✅ No animations create flashing effects >3 Hz

### 4. Testing
**File:** `src/accessibility/reduced-motion.test.tsx`

Created comprehensive tests that verify:
- ✅ Components respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- ✅ Components render normally without the preference
- ✅ No animations flash more than 3 times per second

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Reduced Motion Support (3 tests)
  ✓ respects prefers-reduced-motion: reduce
  ✓ allows animations when prefers-reduced-motion is not set
  ✓ ensures no animations flash more than 3 times per second
```

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 15.2
✅ **THE System SHALL respect prefers-reduced-motion user preference**
- Implemented comprehensive CSS media query
- All animations and transitions are disabled when user prefers reduced motion
- Tested with mock matchMedia API

### Requirement 15.3
✅ **THE System SHALL ensure no animations flash more than 3 times per second**
- All transitions are smooth interpolations (not flashing)
- Fastest transition is 200ms (5 Hz) but it's a smooth transition, not a flash
- Spinner animations are continuous rotations (not flashing)
- With reduced motion, all animations are instant (0.01ms)

## Browser Support
The `prefers-reduced-motion` media query is supported in:
- Chrome 74+
- Firefox 63+
- Safari 10.1+
- Edge 79+

## User Experience
When a user enables "Reduce motion" in their OS settings:
- All transitions become instant
- Progress bars fill immediately
- Tooltips appear/disappear instantly
- Loading spinners don't rotate
- Hover effects are instant
- No smooth scrolling

This provides a comfortable experience for users with:
- Vestibular disorders
- Motion sensitivity
- Epilepsy concerns
- Personal preference for reduced motion

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ CSS media query implemented in `src/index.css`
2. ✅ All animation classes covered
3. ✅ Tests created and passing
4. ✅ No flashing animations >3 Hz
5. ✅ Requirements 15.2 and 15.3 satisfied

## Status
**COMPLETE** - All reduced motion support has been implemented and tested.

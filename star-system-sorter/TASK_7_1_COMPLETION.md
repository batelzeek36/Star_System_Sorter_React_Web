# Task 7.1 Completion: EvidenceMatrix Component

## Summary

Successfully implemented the EvidenceMatrix component with all required features including filtering, sorting, virtualization, and accessibility support.

## Implementation Details

### Component Location
- **File**: `src/components/lore/EvidenceMatrix.tsx`
- **Test File**: `src/components/lore/EvidenceMatrix.test.tsx`
- **Export**: Added to `src/components/lore/index.ts`

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Core Functionality
- ✅ Displays contributors in a table format with 5 columns:
  - Attribute Type (Gate/Channel/Center/Profile/Type/Authority)
  - Attribute (contributor label)
  - Weight (2 decimal places)
  - Confidence (visual dots: ●●●●○)
  - Sources (SourceBadge components)

#### 2. Filtering
- ✅ "Hide disputed" toggle filter (checkbox)
  - Filters out contributors with disputed sources
  - Default: `true` (from UI store)
- ✅ "Min confidence" slider filter (1-5)
  - Filters contributors by minimum confidence level
  - Default: `2` (from UI store)
- ✅ Real-time filtering with contributor count display

#### 3. Sorting
- ✅ Contributors sorted by weight descending
- ✅ Maintains sort order after filtering

#### 4. Highlighting
- ✅ Active system contributors highlighted with lavender background
- ✅ Hover states for all rows

#### 5. Virtualization
- ✅ Automatic virtualization when >75 contributors
- ✅ Uses `@tanstack/react-virtual` for performance
- ✅ Smooth scrolling with estimated row heights
- ✅ Regular table rendering for smaller lists

#### 6. Accessibility
- ✅ Semantic HTML table structure
- ✅ Proper ARIA labels for slider and confidence indicators
- ✅ Keyboard accessible filters
- ✅ Focus states on interactive elements

### Dependencies Added
- `@tanstack/react-virtual`: ^3.0.0 (for virtualization)

### Integration
- ✅ Integrated with UI Store for filter preferences
- ✅ Uses loreBundle for source lookups
- ✅ Composes with Figma Card and Button components
- ✅ Uses SourceBadge component for source display

### Testing

#### Unit Tests (10 tests, all passing)
1. ✅ Renders evidence matrix with contributors
2. ✅ Displays correct attribute types
3. ✅ Sorts contributors by weight descending
4. ✅ Filters out disputed sources when hideDisputed is true
5. ✅ Filters by minimum confidence level
6. ✅ Displays contributor count
7. ✅ Highlights active system contributors
8. ✅ Shows empty state when no contributors match filters
9. ✅ Renders confidence dots correctly
10. ✅ Displays weight with 2 decimal places

#### Visual Testing
- ✅ Added to DevLoreScreen for manual testing
- ✅ Small list test (10 contributors - regular table)
- ✅ Large list test (80 contributors - virtualized)

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ All tests passing: 10/10
- ✅ Follows existing component patterns
- ✅ Uses CSS variables from design system
- ✅ Responsive design with overflow handling

### Requirements Met

All requirements from task 7.1 have been satisfied:

- ✅ 7.1: Create EvidenceMatrix component at src/components/lore/EvidenceMatrix.tsx
- ✅ 7.2: Compose from Figma Card and Button components
- ✅ 7.3: Display table with required columns including Attribute Type
- ✅ 7.4: Implement "Hide disputed" toggle filter
- ✅ 7.5: Implement "Min confidence" slider filter (1-5)
- ✅ 7.6: Highlight active star system's contributors
- ✅ 7.7: Sort contributors by weight descending
- ✅ 7.8: Virtualize table rows when >75 contributors

## Files Modified

### New Files
1. `src/components/lore/EvidenceMatrix.tsx` (280 lines)
2. `src/components/lore/EvidenceMatrix.test.tsx` (170 lines)

### Modified Files
1. `src/components/lore/index.ts` - Added EvidenceMatrix export
2. `src/screens/DevLoreScreen.tsx` - Added visual tests
3. `package.json` - Added @tanstack/react-virtual dependency

## Next Steps

The EvidenceMatrix component is ready for integration into:
- Phase 5: Why 2.0 Screen Refactor (task 8)
- Phase 6: Dossier Screen (task 9.6)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test -- --run src/components/lore/EvidenceMatrix.test.tsx

# Type check
npm run typecheck

# Visual test (start dev server and navigate to /dev-lore)
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- The component automatically switches between regular and virtualized rendering based on contributor count
- Filter preferences persist via UI Store (localStorage)
- The Attribute Type column was added as specified in requirements 7.3 and 7.4
- Virtualization threshold set at 75 contributors as specified in requirement 7.8
- All styling uses existing CSS variables from the design system

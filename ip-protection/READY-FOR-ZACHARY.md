## ðŸŽ¬ Start Here

**Best starting point:** `ip-protection/STAGE-1-QUICK-START.md`

It has everything in order with exact steps, links, and the metadata to copy-paste into Zenodo.

**Or use:** `ip-protection/STAGE-1-CHECKLIST.md` for checkbox format.

## ðŸ“Š What You'll Accomplish

After ~3-4 hours:
- âœ… Public dataset with permanent DOI
- âœ… Citable research methodology
- âœ… Priority date: October 24, 2025
- âœ… Evidence of competitive landscape
- âœ… Strong defensive publication

**Protection level:** Anyone who tries to copy your methodology later can't claim they invented it first.

**Cost:** $0

## ðŸ’¡ Remember

### You're Publishing:
- Your methodology (how you do research)
- Your prompts (your prompt engineering)
- 3 example outputs (to show it works)
- Your schema (data structure)

### You're NOT Publishing:
- Complete research (that's v1.1.0, v1.2.0, etc.)
- The app (that's Stage 3)
- All 384 GateÂ·Line combinations (future versions)

### Why This Works:
- The **methodology** is what's novel
- You can add research outputs later
- Zenodo supports versioning
- Your approach is protected NOW

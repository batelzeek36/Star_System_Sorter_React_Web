## ✅ What I've Already Prepared For You

I've created the complete Zenodo upload package in `zenodo-upload-v1.0.0/` with:

- ✅ README.md (dataset overview)
- ✅ LICENSE.txt (CC BY 4.0)
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md (v1.0.0 notes)
- ✅ All your methodology files copied
- ✅ All 8 baseline prompts copied
- ✅ All 3 JSON outputs copied
- ✅ Documentation copied
- ✅ Prior art comparison copied

**You just need to:**

1. Add your name in a few places
2. Do the evidence pack (screenshot competitors)
3. Upload to Zenodo

## Step 1: Personalize the Files (5 minutes)

### Replace these placeholders:

**In `zenodo-upload-v1.0.0/README.md`:**

- Line 3: `[YOUR NAME HERE]` → Your full name
- Line 48: `[Your Name]` → Your full name (in citation)
- Line 55: `[Your Name]` → Your full name (in citation)
- Line 99: `[YOUR GITHUB URL HERE]` → Your GitHub repo URL
- Line 101: `[YOUR EMAIL HERE]` → Your email

**In `zenodo-upload-v1.0.0/LICENSE.txt`:**

- Line 2: `[Your Name]` → Your full name

**In `ip-protection/1-prior-art-comparison.md`:**

- Bottom of file: Add your name and sign

### Quick find-replace:

```bash
cd zenodo-upload-v1.0.0
# Replace [Your Name] with your actual name
# Replace [YOUR NAME HERE] with your actual name
# Replace [YOUR GITHUB URL HERE] with your repo URL
# Replace [YOUR EMAIL HERE] with your email
```

## Step 3: Create Zenodo Account (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://zenodo.org/
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. **Recommended:** Use GitHub login (easier)
4. Or: Create account with email
5. Verify your email
6. **Optional:** Get an ORCID iD at https://orcid.org/ (takes 2 min, good for academic credibility)

---

## Step 4: Upload to Zenodo (30 minutes)

### Prepare Upload:

1. Zip the folder:
   ```bash
   cd zenodo-upload-v1.0.0
   zip -r ../zenodo-v1.0.0.zip .
   ```
2. Or just upload files directly (Zenodo accepts both)

### Upload Process:

1. Log in to Zenodo
2. Click "Upload" → "New Upload"
3. Upload all files from `zenodo-upload-v1.0.0/` folder
4. Fill in metadata:

**Copy-paste this metadata:**

Title: Star System Sorter (S³): Human Design Gate·Line to Star System Classification — Research Methodology & Dataset (v1.0.0)
Authors: Zachary Bates
ORCID: [Your ORCID if you have one, otherwise leave blank]

Description:
Star System Sorter (S³) is a digital humanities research project that maps Human Design Gate·Line combinations (384 total) to star system archetypes using scholarly-style comparative mythology research.

This v1.0.0 dataset contains:
- Complete research methodology with quality gates and validation processes
- 8 star system baseline prompts with scholarly-style citation requirements
- 3 completed research outputs (Pleiades, Sirius, Orion Light) with JSON schemas and provenance tracking
- I Ching multi-translation comparison framework
- Transparent scoring rubric for reproducible classification

Research scope: 862-1,656 hours of rigorous comparative mythology research across 9 star systems, 64 Human Design gates, 6 line archetypes, and 384 Gate·Line combinations (in progress).

Key novelty: To our knowledge (as of Oct 2025), first application to combine (1) Human Design Gate·Line granularity, (2) multi-translation I Ching citations, (3) transparent scoring algorithm, and (4) star system lore mapping with scholarly-style provenance.

This is an interpretive humanities project, not scientific prediction. All claims are properly sourced with translator names, ISBNs, and page numbers.

Future versions will include complete research outputs for all star systems, gates, and lines.

Keywords: Human Design, I Ching, Star Systems, Comparative Mythology, Digital Humanities, Starseed, Gate Line Analysis, Pleiades, Sirius, Lyra, Andromeda, Orion, Arcturus, Draco, Zeta Reticuli

5. Review everything carefully
6. Click "Publish"
7. **SAVE BOTH DOIs:**
   - Version DOI (v1.0.0): `10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX`
   - Concept DOI (always latest): `10.5281/zenodo.YYYYYYY`

## Step 5: Update Your Repo (15 minutes)

### Add DOI Badge to Main README:

```markdown
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.YYYYYYY.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.YYYYYYY)

## Research Dataset

The complete research methodology for S³ is publicly archived on Zenodo:

**Citation:**

```

### Commit and Tag:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Stage 1: Add Zenodo v1.0.0 dataset with DOI"
git tag -a v1.0.0-research-dataset -m "Zenodo v1.0.0 published (2025-10-24)"
git push --follow-tags
```

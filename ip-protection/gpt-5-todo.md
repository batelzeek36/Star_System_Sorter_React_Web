Absolutely—I can help you knock out Stage 1 end-to-end. I’ll generate the files/templates right now so you can copy-paste into your repo, and I’ll point you to competitor pages to screenshot for the evidence pack.

## What I need from you (to finish Stage 1)

1. The GitHub repo URL (or confirm I should assume your current structure).
2. Your full name (for Zenodo “Authors” + the signature block).
3. Optional: ORCID iD (if you want it on the Zenodo record).
4. Which baseline prompts you’ve already completed (so I reference the correct files in v1.0.0).
5. The public repo URL you want listed under “Related identifiers” on Zenodo.
6. Confirm CC BY 4.0 is the license you want (default is yes).

If you share those, I’ll tailor the prefilled README/metadata block to you specifically.

# Prior Art Comparison — Star System Sorter (S³)

**Purpose**  
Establish what existed BEFORE S³, and articulate how S³ differs. This dated document is part of Stage 1 defensive publication.

**Scope (Today’s snapshot):**  
- Domain: Human Design + comparative myth/“starseed” lore + defensible research methodology + Gate·Line synthesis rules engine.  
- Deliverables referenced: prompts, partial baselines, sample JSON outputs.

## 1) Market Landscape (Competitor Categories)
- Human Design charting platforms (e.g., myBodyGraph, Genetic Matrix)
- “Starseed” themed reference/quizzes/apps (e.g., Galactic Heritage Cards, web quizzes)
- General spiritual/astrology apps
- Academic & gray-literature on myth/ET lore (indices, forums, wikis)

## 2) Representative Competitors (for Evidence Pack screenshots)
- myBodyGraph official site and app pages (Jovian Archive)  
- Genetic Matrix plans/features and “Talking Chart” pages  
- Galactic Heritage Cards app (iOS/Android)  
- Example “starseed quiz” pages (for landscape only)

## 3) What They Do
- Compute/display Human Design charts; paid analyses; learning tools.  
- “Starseed” apps/quizzes/reading decks for entertainment/divination/guidance.

## 4) What They Don’t Do (and where S³ is novel)
- A documented, citable, **two-sided** research method:  
  - Side A: Canonical Gate/Line meanings (Ra Uru Hu/Gene Keys, etc.).  
  - Side B: **Documented star-system characteristics** (with citations + quotes).  
  - **Then** a rules engine maps Gate·Line → star-system with traceable rationale.  
- Versioned dataset with DOI (Zenodo) proving methodology existed **now**.  
- Gate·Line (384) synthesis targets, not just gate-only, with provenance JSON.

## 5) Evidence Links (for reference)
- myBodyGraph site: https://www.mybodygraph.com/ (official)  
- Genetic Matrix: https://www.geneticmatrix.com/plans-features/ (features overview)  
- Galactic Heritage Cards (Google Play / App Store)  
- Example “starseed quiz” pages

## 6) Statement of Independent Development
S³ methodology, prompts, and synthesis approach were developed independently as described in the Zenodo v1.0.0 dataset. This document establishes the market context and S³’s distinct method.

## Next steps (fastest path)

1. Tell me your **full name**, **repo URL**, and which **baseline prompt files** are ready.
2. I’ll swap placeholders and give you a **ready-to-publish** README/metadata block.
3. You run the evidence-pack searches + screenshots (with the template above).
4. Create a Zenodo account and publish v1.0.0 (I already formatted everything you need). ([Zenodo][7])
5. Paste me the two DOIs and I’ll give you the exact README badge + citation text to commit.

If you want, I can also generate a one-liner reminder you can drop into your calendar/task system for **2026-01-24** (“Quarterly Evidence Pack update”).

## 💡 Key Points

### You're Publishing:
- Your methodology (how you do research)
- Your prompts (your prompt engineering)
- Example outputs (3 JSONs to show it works)
- Your schema (data structure)

### You're NOT Publishing:
- Complete research (that comes in v1.1.0, v1.2.0, etc.)
- The app (that's Stage 3)
- All 384 Gate·Line combinations (future versions)

### Why This Works:
- The **methodology** is what's novel
- You can add research outputs later
- Zenodo supports versioning
- Your approach is protected NOW

---

## 📊 What You'll Accomplish

**After ~4-5 hours:**
- ✅ Public dataset with permanent DOI
- ✅ Citable research methodology
- ✅ Priority date (Oct 24, 2025)
- ✅ Evidence of competitive landscape
- ✅ Strong defensive publication

**Protection level:** Anyone who tries to copy your methodology later can't claim they invented it first.

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to finish all my research first?**  
A: No! You're publishing methodology now, outputs later.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**  
A: Publish v1.0.1 with corrections. Old version stays available.

**Q: Can I add more later?**  
A: Yes! That's what v1.1.0, v1.2.0, v2.0.0 are for.

**Q: Is this enough protection?**  
A: Yes for defensive publication. Copyright ($85) is optional Stage 2.

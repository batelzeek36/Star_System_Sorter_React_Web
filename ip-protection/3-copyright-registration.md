# Copyright Registration Guide - Star System Sorter (S³)

**U.S. Copyright Office Registration**

---

## What is Copyright?

Copyright automatically protects your original creative work from the moment it's created. However, **registering** your copyright provides:

- ✅ **Legal proof** of ownership with official date
- ✅ **Ability to sue** for infringement in federal court
- ✅ **Statutory damages** ($750-$30,000 per work; up to $150,000 for willful infringement) instead of just actual damages
- ✅ **Attorney's fees** if you win infringement case
- ⚠️ **Important:** Statutory damages and attorney's fees are only available if you registered **before infringement** or **within 3 months of first publication**
- ✅ **Public record** of your claim
- ✅ **Deterrent** to potential copiers

**Cost:** $45-$85 depending on type (see details below)  
**Time:** ~2.1 months average for certificate (protection starts immediately upon filing)

---

## What to Register for S³

You have several options depending on your needs:

### Option 1: Single Collective Work (Standard App - $65)

**If you want one filing:** Compile a single, continuous **"S³ Research Compendium"** (a true collective work) and register that one Literary Work.

**Important:** This covers the compilation (your selection, coordination, and arrangement) and only covers each included piece if:

- All content is yours (not licensed from others)
- None of the pieces were previously published or registered separately

**Includes:**

- All 9 star system baseline prompts
- Bulletproof methodology documents
- Research documentation
- Template prompts
- JSON schemas

**Advantage:** One fee, easier to manage  
**Limitation:** May not cover individual pieces if they were published separately

---

### Option 2: Group of Unpublished Works - GRUW ($85)

**Best for:** Up to 10 unpublished works in one claim

**What qualifies:**

- All works must be unpublished
- All by same author
- All owned by same claimant

**Example registration:**

1. Bulletproof Methodology (unpublished)
2. Pleiades Baseline Prompt (unpublished)
3. Sirius Baseline Prompt (unpublished)
4. [Up to 7 more works]

**Advantage:** Covers each work individually  
**Cost:** $85 for up to 10 works

---

### Option 3: Group of Short Online Literary Works - GRTX

**Best for:** 2-50 short online works (50-17,500 words each)

**What qualifies:**

- First published online within a 3-month window
- Each work 50-17,500 words
- All by same author

**Example:** If you publish your prompts online on GitHub/Zenodo within 3 months

**Advantage:** Covers multiple published works  
**Cost:** See current fee schedule on copyright.gov

---

### Option 4: Individual Registrations (Single App $45 or Standard $65 each)

Register separately for maximum protection:

**Single Application ($45 each) - if eligible:**

- One author
- Same claimant
- One work
- Not made for hire

**Standard Application ($65 each):**

- Any work that doesn't qualify for Single App

**Example registrations:**

1. "Star System Sorter: Bulletproof Research Methodology"
2. "Star System Sorter: Star System Baseline Prompts"
3. "Star System Sorter: Scoring Algorithm Documentation"

**Advantage:** Most specific protection  
**Cost:** $45-$65 per work

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to register before publishing?**  
A: No, but it's recommended. You can register within 3 months of publication and still get full benefits.

**Q: What if someone copies my work before I get the certificate?**  
A: Your protection starts the day you file, not when you receive the certificate. The certificate is just proof. However, statutory damages and attorney's fees are only available if you registered before infringement or within 3 months of first publication.

**Q: Can I register updates later?**  
A: Yes, you can register new versions as "derivative works" for $65 each.

**Q: What about my code/app?**  
A: Software code is registered separately as a "Computer Program" (different form). For code, submit first 25 pages + last 25 pages of source code (trade-secret options available). This registration guide is primarily for your research/documentation.

**Q: Do I need a lawyer?**  
A: No, copyright registration is designed for self-filing. Only hire a lawyer if you're facing infringement or have complex questions.

**Q: What if my application is rejected?**  
A: Rare, but you'll get a letter explaining why. Usually fixable by providing more info. Fee is non-refundable.

## Next Steps After All Three Filings

Once you complete all three:

1. ✅ Prior art comparison (document #1) - Filed internally
2. ✅ Zenodo dataset (document #2) - Public DOI
3. ✅ Copyright registration (document #3) - Legal protection

**You will have:**

- Documented proof of novelty
- Public, citable research record with timestamp
- Legal copyright protection with enforcement rights
- Strong IP position before launch

**Timeline:**

- Prior art: Done (internal document)
- Zenodo: 2-3 hours (instant DOI)
- Copyright: 30 minutes to file, 3-12 months for certificate (protection starts immediately)

**Total cost:** $65 (copyright) + $0 (Zenodo) = $65

---

**Ready to file?** Start with Zenodo (document #2) to get your DOI, then use that DOI in your copyright registration.

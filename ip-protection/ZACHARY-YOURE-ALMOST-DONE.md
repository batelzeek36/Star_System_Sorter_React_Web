## 💡 Remember

### You're Publishing:
- Your methodology (how you do research)
- Your prompts (your prompt engineering)
- 3 example outputs (to show it works)
- Your schema (data structure)

### You're NOT Publishing:
- Complete research (that's v1.1.0, v1.2.0, etc.)
- The app (that's Stage 3)
- All 384 Gate·Line combinations (future versions)

### Why This Works:
- The **methodology** is what's novel
- You can add research outputs later
- Zenodo supports versioning
- Your approach is protected NOW

## Document 2: Zenodo Dataset Package

**Status:** ✅ Corrected  
**Date:** October 24, 2025

### Material Inaccuracies Fixed:

#### 1. Google Scholar Indexing ❌ → ✅
**Incorrect claim:**
> "Is indexed by Google Scholar and academic databases"

**Correction:**
> "Note: Google Scholar does not index Zenodo at this time (per Zenodo). Your DOI is still resolvable and citable via DataCite and common reference managers."

**Source:** https://support.zenodo.org/help/en-gb/29-indexing/61-is-zenodo-indexed-by-google-scholar

---

#### 2. File Limits & Quotas ❌ → ✅
**Incorrect claim:**
> "FREE - Zenodo is completely free for uploads up to 50GB per dataset."

**Correction:**
> "FREE - Zenodo is completely free for uploads.
> 
> Default limits:
> - 50 GB per record
> - Up to 100 files per record
> 
> Larger needs: May be granted once (up to ~200 GB for a single record) on request; file-count cap still applies."

**Source:** https://support.zenodo.org/help/en-gb/1-upload-deposit/80-what-are-the-size-limitations-of-zenodo

---

#### 3. DOI Versioning Mechanics ❌ → ✅
**Incorrect claim:**
> "Zenodo creates a new DOI (e.g., v1.0.1). Original DOI still works and redirects to latest version"

**Correction:**
> "Zenodo assigns:
> - A **version DOI** (this specific upload)
> - A **concept DOI** (the family of versions; always resolves to the latest by default)
> 
> Important: Older version DOIs remain valid and point to their specific snapshots; they do not redirect. The concept DOI always points to the latest version by default."

**Source:** https://support.zenodo.org/help/en-gb/1-upload-deposit/97-what-is-doi-versioning

---

#### 4. Preservation Claim Precision ⚠️ → ✅
**Imprecise claim:**
> "Ensures long-term preservation (minimum 20 years)"

**Correction:**
> "Commits to long-term preservation (at least 20 years, tied to CERN's programme)"

**Source:** https://about.zenodo.org/policies/

### Additional Improvements:

5. **License guidance enhanced**
   - Added: "For code, consider MIT/Apache-2.0"
   - Clarified: "For data, CC BY 4.0 (or CC0 if you want maximal reuse)"

6. **Language consistency**
   - "Academic-grade" → "scholarly-style, citation-based"
   - Added "to our knowledge (as of Oct 2025)" to novelty claims

7. **DOI usage clarification**

   - Added both to citation templates

## Document 3: Copyright Registration

**Status:** ✅ Corrected  
**Date:** October 24, 2025

### Material Inaccuracies Fixed:

#### 1. Registration Options for Multiple Works ❌ → ✅
**Incorrect claim:**
> "Option 1: Single Collection (Recommended - $65) - One fee covers everything"

**Problem:** Standard Application cannot register a "collection of unpublished works" without specific conditions.

**Correction:** Added proper options:
- **Standard App ($65):** Only for true collective work where all pieces are yours and not previously published
- **GRUW ($85):** Up to 10 unpublished works in one claim
- **GRTX:** 2-50 short online works (50-17,500 words) published within 3 months
- **Single App ($45):** One author, same claimant, one work, not for hire

**Sources:** 
- GRUW: https://www.copyright.gov/rulemaking/group-unpublished-works/
- GRTX: https://www.copyright.gov/rulemaking/group-registration/
- Collective works: https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ14.pdf

---

#### 2. Fees & Timelines ❌ → ✅
**Incorrect claims:**
> "$65 (online filing)"
> "Processing time: 3-12 months (currently ~8 months average)"

**Correction:**
- Added Single Application: $45
- Added GRUW: $85
- Added GRTX: varies
- Added Special Handling: +$800
- **Processing time:** ~2.1 months average (recent Office data)

#### 3. Statutory Damages Caveat ❌ → ✅
**Missing critical information:** Didn't mention eligibility requirements

**Correction:** Added:
> "Statutory damages ($750-$30,000 per work; up to $150,000 for willful) and attorney's fees are only available if you registered **before infringement** or **within 3 months of first publication**"

**Source:** https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412

---

#### 4. Publication Status ❌ → ✅
**Incorrect guidance:**
> "Published: Yes, Date: 2025-10-24, Nation: United States"

**Problem:** Hardcoded assumptions about publication status and nation

**Correction:**
- Select "Published = Yes" only if distributed copies to public
- Nation of First Publication: US only if first published same day in US and another country
- Otherwise select actual country of first publication
- If unpublished, select "No"

**Source:** https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf

---

#### 5. Deposit File Limits ⚠️ → ✅
**Imprecise:**
> "Size: Under 500MB"

**Correction:**
- ≤500 MB **per file**
- Multiple files allowed (split/ZIP if needed)
- For code: first 25 + last 25 pages of source

**Source:** https://www.copyright.gov/eco/help-deposit.html

---

#### 6. License Text Conflict ❌ → ✅
**Contradictory notice:**
> "Licensed under CC BY 4.0... Commercial use requires separate license"

**Problem:** CC BY 4.0 **allows** commercial use with attribution

**Correction:** Created three separate options:
- **Option A:** All rights reserved (commercial licensing on request)
- **Option B:** CC BY 4.0 (allows commercial use with attribution)
- **Option C:** CC BY-NC 4.0 (noncommercial only, with attribution)

**Note:** This is the license's plain meaning - no citation needed

---

#### 7. AI Disclosure ❌ → ✅
**Missing:** No mention of AI-generated content requirements

**Correction:** Added to "Limitation of Claim":
> "If any parts were generated by AI, you must exclude non-human authorship. Example: 'Exclude AI-generated text. Claim limited to human authorship: selection, arrangement, annotations, and edits.'"

**Source:** https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/16/2023-05321/copyright-registration-guidance-works-containing-material-generated-by-artificial-intelligence

---

#### 8. Registration Number Format ❌ → ✅
**Incorrect format:**
> "U.S. Copyright Registration: TXu-XXXXXXX"

**Correction:**
- 12-character format: TX0001234567 (published)
- Older unpublished may use TXU format
- Don't pre-format - use exact number from certificate

**Source:** https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html

---

#### 9. Software/Code Registration ⚠️ → ✅
**Incomplete:**
> "Software code is registered separately"

**Correction:** Added deposit rules:
- Submit first 25 pages + last 25 pages of source code
- Trade-secret options available

**Source:** https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ61.pdf

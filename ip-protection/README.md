# IP Protection Package - Star System Sorter (S¬≥)

This folder contains everything you need to establish intellectual property protection for your Star System Sorter research before public launch.

---

## Quick Start

**Complete these three steps in order:**

1. **Review Prior Art** ‚Üí `1-prior-art-comparison.md`
   - Read and sign the document
   - Keep for your records
   - Time: 30 minutes

2. **Publish on Zenodo** ‚Üí `2-zenodo-dataset-package.md`
   - Create free account at https://zenodo.org/
   - Upload your research files
   - Get permanent DOI (instant)
   - Time: 2-3 hours
   - Cost: FREE

3. **Register Copyright** ‚Üí `3-copyright-registration.md`
   - File at https://www.copyright.gov/
   - Upload deposit copy (PDF)
   - Pay $65 fee
   - Time: 30 minutes to file, 3-12 months for certificate
   - Cost: $65

## Why This Matters

Your research represents **862-1,656 hours** of rigorous work combining:
- Human Design Gate¬∑Line analysis (384 combinations)
- Multi-translation I Ching citations
- Star system lore mapping
- Transparent scoring methodology

**No existing application does this.** These three steps establish:
- ‚úÖ **Proof of novelty** (what existed before you)
- ‚úÖ **Public timestamp** (when you created it)
- ‚úÖ **Legal protection** (ability to enforce your rights)

## Timeline to Launch

**If you complete all three steps this week:**
- Prior art: Done immediately
- Zenodo DOI: Available in 2-3 hours
- Copyright protection: Starts immediately upon filing

**You can launch your MVP as soon as:**
1. ‚úÖ Zenodo dataset is published (DOI assigned)
2. ‚úÖ Copyright application is filed (protection starts)
3. ‚úÖ Copyright notices are added to all files

**You do NOT need to wait for the copyright certificate** (that takes 3-12 months). Protection begins the moment you file.

## What This Protects

### Your Research Methodology ‚úÖ
- Bulletproof citation requirements
- Quality gates and validation processes
- Scoring algorithm and weights
- Gate¬∑Line analysis framework

### Your Prompts ‚úÖ
- 9 star system baseline prompts
- Template prompts (Pass A, Pass C)
- Prompt engineering methodology

### Your Data Structures ‚úÖ
- JSON schemas
- Citation format
- Provenance tracking system

### Your Synthesis ‚úÖ
- Star system to HD mapping logic
- Interpretive framework
- Classification algorithm

### What It Doesn't Protect ‚ùå
- Ideas (only expression of ideas)
- Facts (I Ching line texts themselves)
- Methods/processes (need patent for that)
- Names/titles (need trademark for that)

---

## Optional: Provisional Patent

If you want to protect your **scoring algorithm** as a method/process (not just documentation), consider a provisional patent application:

- **Cost:** $75-$300 (DIY) or $2,000-$5,000 (with attorney)
- **Protection:** 12 months to file full patent
- **Website:** https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/types-patent-applications/provisional-application-patent
- **Recommendation:** Only if you plan to commercialize and have budget

For most indie projects, **copyright + Zenodo is sufficient** for establishing prior art and protecting your work.

**Ready to start?** Begin with document #1 (Prior Art Comparison), then proceed to #2 (Zenodo), then #3 (Copyright).

Good luck! üöÄ

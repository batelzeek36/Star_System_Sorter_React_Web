## ‚ùì Questions?

**Q: Do I need to finish all my research first?**  
A: No! You're publishing your methodology now, research outputs later.

**Q: What if I find a mistake after publishing?**  
A: Publish v1.0.1 with corrections. Old version stays available.

**Q: Can I add more research later?**  
A: Yes! Publish v1.1.0, v1.2.0, etc. as you complete more.

**Q: Is this enough protection?**  
A: Yes for defensive publication. Stage 2 (copyright) adds legal teeth but is optional.

**Q: How long does Zenodo take?**  
A: Upload is instant. DOI is assigned immediately.

# Prior Art Comparison & Novelty Documentation (REV B)

**Star System Sorter (S³)**  
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Project:** Human Design Gate·Line → Star-System Classification (Digital Humanities)

---

## 0) Scope & Claims (Read First)

This document establishes **what S³ claims to do**, **what existed as of Oct 24, 2025**, and **why the implementation appears novel**. It frames S³ as a **digital humanities** project that:

- Anchors interpretations in **primary texts** (I Ching line texts, HD structure)
- **Corroborates** across sources
- Produces a **transparent, reproducible synthesis** (Gate·Line level) with **clearly labeled interpretive layers**

We do **not** claim scientific proof. We present a **scholarly-style, citation-based synthesis** with explicit limits.

---

## 1) Executive Summary

S³ combines, in one system:

1. **Gate·Line analysis (384 combos)** with **multi-translation I Ching citations**
2. **Star-system mapping** as a clearly labeled **interpretive layer** (not science)
3. A **transparent scoring rubric** with reproducible outputs

**To our knowledge (as of Oct 24, 2025), no public application combines these three elements.** The market has adjacent platforms (HD charting, starseed tools, galactic astrology) but none that synthesize all three with scholarly-style provenance.

**Relationship to HD Platforms:** S³ is designed to **augment** existing Human Design outputs, not replace them. We treat HD platforms as upstream data sources and add a synthesis layer they don't offer.

---

## 2) Prior Art Analysis (What exists vs. S³)

### Category 1: Human Design Charting Platforms (Adjacent/Upstream)

**What they do:** Compute and present Human Design charts (type, authority, profile, centers, channels, gates, and sometimes line texts). These platforms serve as **upstream data sources** for HD information.

**Relationship to S³:** S³ treats these as **adjacent/complementary platforms**, not competitors. We augment their outputs with a synthesis layer they don't offer.

**Examples:**

- **myBodyGraph** (Jovian Archive) - https://www.mybodygraph.com/
- **Genetic Matrix** - https://www.geneticmatrix.com/
- **My Human Design** - https://www.myhumandesign.com/

**What S³ Adds (Distinctly):**

- ✅ **Gate·Line-level corroboration** with multi-translation I Ching citations
- ✅ **Transparent star-lore scoring layer** with reproducible methodology
- ✅ **Synthesis of HD structure + I Ching exegesis + star system mapping**
- ✅ **Full provenance tracking** (translator names, ISBNs, page numbers)

**Key Point:** S³ is **complementary, not substitutive**. We build on HD data and contribute a new, documented synthesis layer.

**Conclusion:** These platforms provide the HD foundation; S³ adds the star-system synthesis with scholarly-style citations.

---

### Category 2: Starseed/Galactic Heritage Tools

**What they do:** Provide star lineage divination, galactic origin readings, starseed identification.

**What they don't do:** Integrate **Human Design** or **I Ching line exegesis**, nor publish **citations + scoring**.

**Examples:**

- **Galactic Heritage Cards** (Lyssa Royal Holt) - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/galactic-heritage-cards/id1605346949
- **Starseed Oracle Decks** - Various card-based divination systems
- **Starseed Quizzes** - https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/story.php?title=which-starseed-are-you-quiz

**Key Difference from S³:**

- ✅ They explore star system archetypes and galactic origins
- ❌ They do NOT integrate Human Design data
- ❌ They do NOT use I Ching hexagram/line analysis
- ❌ They do NOT provide scholarly citations or transparent methodology
- ❌ They rely on intuitive readings, card draws, or entertainment quizzes

**Conclusion:** Star-lore only; **no HD integration or scholarly apparatus**.

---

### Category 3: Galactic/Fixed-Star Astrology

**What they do:** Map natal chart planetary positions to fixed stars for lineage interpretation.

**What they don't do:** Use **Human Design Gate·Line** units or I Ching line analysis; no Gate·Line scoring.

**Examples:**

- **Galactic Astrology Chart** - https://www.galacticastrochart.com/
- **Fixed Star Reports** - Various astrology services mapping planets to Pleiades, Sirius, etc.

**Key Difference from S³:**

- ✅ They connect birth charts to star systems
- ❌ They use Western astrology planetary positions, NOT Human Design gates/lines
- ❌ They do NOT analyze I Ching hexagram line texts
- ❌ They do NOT provide Gate·Line level granularity (384 combinations)
- ❌ They do NOT use a transparent, reproducible scoring algorithm

**Conclusion:** Astrology-based lineage; **methodologically distinct** from S³.

---

## 3) What Makes S³ Novel (Four Pillars)

### 1. Unit of Meaning: Gate·Line (384)

- Each Gate·Line treated as an **irreducible archetype**
- **Multi-translation I Ching** comparison → **root essence** + citations
- **HD structural context** (center, circuit, channel) applied before any lore
- **Prior art:** Some HD apps display line texts, but don't perform **line-level synthesis with multi-translation citations or star-system scoring**

### 2. Corroborate → Synthesize (Show Your Work)

- **Corroboration:** At least two I Ching translations; save one ≤25-word quote; record translator names/refs
- **Synthesis:** Deterministic rubric converts features → **scored hypotheses** (e.g., star-system fit) with one-sentence rationales
- **Prior art:** No tool combines corroboration + synthesis with transparent methodology

### 3. Transparent Scoring Rubric (Reproducible)

- Default weights: I Ching feature match **0.35**, HD structure **0.35**, Phenomenology **0.20**, Lore coherence **0.10**
- Same inputs → same outputs; **provenance + confidence** stored per entry
- **Prior art:** Starseed tools use intuitive/random methods; HD apps don't classify to star systems

### 4. Data vs. Interpretation (Hard Wall)

- **Data layer:** I Ching quotes, HD structure, citations (verifiable)
- **Interpretation layer:** Phenomenology, planetary **modifiers** (non-definitional), star-lore hypotheses. Clearly labeled **interpretive**
- **Prior art:** Most tools blend data and interpretation without clear boundaries

---

## 4) Respect for Source Traditions

- **I Ching:** Cite hexagram/line, translators, and (optionally) Chinese text; note key translation choices
- **Human Design lineage:** Describe inputs accurately (I Ching, Western Astrology, Kabbalah/Tree of Life, Hindu-Brahmin chakra model)
- **Framing:** HD and star-lore are **modern receptions** of older traditions, not their original intent
- **Cultural respect:** Acknowledge origins, avoid appropriation, cite properly

---

## 5) Limitations & Risks

- **Novelty claim is time-bound** ("to our knowledge, as of Oct 24, 2025")
- **Hidden indie work** may exist; we maintain an **evidence pack** and update periodically
- **Interpretive layer ≠ proof**; it is labeled and scored to avoid category errors
- **Patentability is uncertain** for abstract scoring; prioritize **defensive publication (DOI)** and **trademark/brand**
- **Some HD apps show line descriptions** - our novelty is in **synthesis with citations + star-system scoring**, not mere display

---

## 6) Novelty Statement (Conditioned)

**To our knowledge, as of October 24, 2025, S³ is the first public application to:**

1. Analyze **Human Design at the Gate·Line level** with **multi-translation I Ching citations**
2. Map those Gate·Lines to **star-system archetypes** using a **transparent, reproducible rubric**
3. Publish **scholarly-style provenance** (translator names, page/section refs) while **separating data from interpretation**

**No prior art combines these three elements.**

---

## 7) Evidence Pack Manifest (Attach/Link)

- **Market survey log:** Dates, search terms, engines, app stores
- **Screenshots/PDFs:** Representative pages of each comparable
- **Method files:** `METHODS.md`, `CITATION_GUIDE.md`, rubric YAML, JSON schemas
- **Sample dataset:** A few Gate·Line entries with full citations
- **Versioning:** Repo tag + **Zenodo DOI** (timestamped)

---

## 8) Time & Effort (Estimate Range; Document Assumptions)

- Star-system baselines: **30–45h**
- 64 gates (3 passes): **136–272h**
- Line archetypes (non-definitional): **12–15h**
- Gate·Line synthesis (manual Tier 1 + algorithmic Tiers 2–3): **~600–1,199h**
- Methods & release: **16–23h**

**Total:** **~862–1,656h** (estimates; see METHODS for assumptions)

---

## 9) Technical Implementation Notes

- **Schemas:** Zod/AJV validation; CI blocks missing citations/provenance
- **Scoring:** Deterministic function with published weights; configurable
- **Caching:** Deterministic outputs; 30-day TTL OK for UX, not for provenance
- **Privacy:** No PII; hashed cache keys only

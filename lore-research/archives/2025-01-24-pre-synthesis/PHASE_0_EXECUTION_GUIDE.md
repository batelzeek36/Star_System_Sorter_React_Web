# Phase 0 Execution Guide - Star System Baseline Research

## What You Just Got

I've created **9 bulletproof prompts** for establishing the scholarly foundation of your Star System Sorter project. These prompts will give you properly cited characteristics for each star system, which you'll then use to map Human Design gates.

## The Complete Package

### üìÅ Location
`lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/`

### üìÑ Files Created

1. **INDEX.md** - Master overview (start here)
2. **QUICK_START.md** - Step-by-step walkthrough
3. **README.md** - Detailed documentation
4. **SIRIUS_BASELINE.txt** - Copy-paste prompt for Sirius
5. **PLEIADES_BASELINE.txt** - Copy-paste prompt for Pleiades
6. **ORION_LIGHT_BASELINE.txt** - Copy-paste prompt for Orion Light
7. **ARCTURUS_BASELINE.txt** - Copy-paste prompt for Arcturus
8. **ANDROMEDA_BASELINE.txt** - Copy-paste prompt for Andromeda

10. **DRACO_BASELINE.txt** - Copy-paste prompt for Draco
11. **ZETA_RETICULI_BASELINE.txt** - Copy-paste prompt for Zeta Reticuli

### üìÇ Output Directory
`lore-research/research-outputs/star-systems/` - Where you'll save JSON responses

## How to Execute (Simple Version)

### Step 1: Read the Guide
Open `lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/QUICK_START.md`

### Step 2: Start with Sirius
1. Open `SIRIUS_BASELINE.txt`
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste into Perplexity Comet
4. Wait for JSON response (2-5 minutes)

### Step 3: Validate Response
Check that it has:
- ‚úÖ 3-5 characteristics
- ‚úÖ 5+ sources per characteristic
- ‚úÖ Specific page numbers (not "unknown")
- ‚úÖ Actual quotes ‚â§25 words
- ‚úÖ Edition information
- ‚úÖ URLs where available

### Step 4: Save Response
Save as `lore-research/research-outputs/star-systems/sirius-baseline.json`

### Step 5: Repeat for All 8
Do the same for Pleiades, Orion Light, Arcturus, Andromeda, Lyra, Draco, Zeta Reticuli

### Step 6: Compile Results
After all 8 are done, compile into `COMPILED_BASELINES.yaml`

## Why This Matters

**Your ancient sources (Enuma Elish, MUL.APIN, etc.) are referenced in these prompts.** They provide the scholarly grounding that makes your gate mappings defensible.

### The Logic Chain

```
Ancient Texts ‚Üí Star System Characteristics ‚Üí HD Gate Mappings
     ‚Üë                    ‚Üë                           ‚Üë
  Phase 0            Phase 0 Output              Phase 1
(You're here)      (What you'll get)         (What comes next)
```

## What You'll Get from Phase 0

After completing all 9 prompts, you'll have:

‚úÖ **Sirius** - Teachers/guardians (Egyptian Sopdet + Law of One + Dogon with disputes noted)
‚úÖ **Pleiades** - Nurturers/artists (Seven Sisters cross-cultural + Marciniak)
‚úÖ **Orion Light** - Historians/strategists (Egyptian Orion-Osiris + Bauval + Hermetic)
‚úÖ **Orion Dark** - Control/hierarchy (Law of One + Lyssa Royal, shadow work themes)
‚úÖ **Andromeda** - Freedom/sovereignty (Collier + Lyssa Royal, symbolic Greek myth)
‚úÖ **Lyra** - Primordial root race (Lyssa Royal + Cannon, modern-only noted)
‚úÖ **Arcturus** - Healers/engineers (Cayce + Milanovich + Kenyon, modern-only noted)
‚úÖ **Draco** - Power/hierarchy/dragon archetype (Ancient dragon myths + Icke disputed + East/West duality, NOT kundalini)
‚úÖ **Zeta Reticuli** - Analysts/experimenters (Hill case disputed + Bashar + UFO lore)

## Time Investment

- **Per star system:** 2-3 hours
- **Total:** 18-27 hours
- **Compilation:** 2-4 hours
- **Grand total:** ~20-28 hours

## Quality Standards

### GOOD Citation Example
```json
{
  "title": "The Sirius Mystery: New Scientific Evidence of Alien Contact 5,000 Years Ago",
  "author": "Robert K. G. Temple",
  "edition": "50th Anniversary Edition",
  "year": 2019,
  "original_year": 1976,
  "page": "Chapter 3, pp. 67-69",
  "quote": "The Dogon describe the Nommo as amphibious beings from Sirius.",
  "url": "https://www.sirius-mystery.com",
  "source_type": "research"
}
```

### BAD Citation Example
```json
{
  "title": "The Sirius Mystery",
  "author": "Temple",
  "page": "unknown",
  "quote": "Discusses Sirius teachings",
  "source_type": "research"
}
```

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Don't accept weak citations** - Re-prompt if page numbers are missing
2. **Mix source types** - Not all channeled, not all modern
3. **Note disputes** - Dogon, Hill star map, Icke reptilians
4. **Separate ancient from modern** - Label ancient support levels
5. **Save as you go** - Don't lose work

## After Phase 0

Once you have all 8 baselines with proper citations, you can:

1. **Proceed to Phase 1** - Use Pass A/B/C templates for gate research
2. **Reference star system characteristics** - Now you have documented traits to match against gates
3. **Cite with confidence** - Every star system trait has 5+ sources backing it up

## The Payoff

**This is the foundation that makes your entire project academically defensible.** Without Phase 0, gate mappings are just guesses. With Phase 0, they're scholarly synthesis backed by ancient texts, modern research, and properly documented sources.

## Questions?

- **"Do I really need to do all 9?"** - Yes. Each star system/faction needs its own baseline.
- **"Can I skip the ancient sources?"** - No. They provide the historical depth that gives your work legitimacy.
- **"What if Comet can't find citations?"** - Re-prompt with stricter requirements. The sources exist.
- **"How do I know if I'm done?"** - When all 9 JSON files pass the quality checklist.

## Ready to Start?

1. Open `lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/INDEX.md`
2. Read `QUICK_START.md`
3. Copy `SIRIUS_BASELINE.txt` into Perplexity Comet
4. Begin your research

**This is the foundation. Take your time and do it right.**

## Your Ancient Sources Are Already Integrated

The prompts reference:
- ‚úÖ Enuma Elish (Babylonian creation epic)
- ‚úÖ MUL.APIN (Babylonian star catalog)
- ‚úÖ Pyramid Texts (Egyptian)
- ‚úÖ Epic of Gilgamesh
- ‚úÖ Sumerian King List
- ‚úÖ Cross-cultural dragon myths
- ‚úÖ Seven Sisters myths globally

**They're in the right place** - providing foundational legitimacy for star system characteristics, not forced into gate descriptions where they don't belong.

## Document Status

# Baseline Prompt Updates - Complete

**Date:** January 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All 6 remaining baseline prompts updated

## What Was Updated

All baseline prompts now include:

### 1. ACADEMIC CONTEXT Section
Added after OBJECTIVE, includes:
- Human Design's 8 academic foundations (I Ching, DNA codons, Kabbalah, etc.)
- Mathematical correspondences (64 hexagrams = 64 codons)
- Framing as "comparative mythology research, not pseudoscience"

### 2. Enhanced JSON Structure
Added to OUTPUT FORMAT section:
- `version` and `last_updated` fields
- `methodology` object with framework and academic foundations
- `academic_context` object with Human Design foundations
- `bibliography` object with ancient texts, modern research, and academic foundations

## Files Updated

1. ✅ **Pleiades** - `lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/PLEIADES_BASELINE.txt`
2. ✅ **Andromeda** - `lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/ANDROMEDA_BASELINE.txt`
3. ✅ **Lyra** - `lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/LYRA_BASELINE.txt`
4. ✅ **Draco** - `lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/DRACO_BASELINE.txt`
5. ✅ **Orion Dark** - `lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/ORION_DARK_BASELINE.txt`
6. ✅ **Arcturus** - `lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/ARCTURUS_BASELINE.txt`

## Already Updated (Previous Session)

- ✅ **Sirius** - Used as template for all updates
- ✅ **Orion Light** - Updated in previous session

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Re-run Research (12-18 hours)
Re-run all 9 star systems with enhanced prompts:

**Need Re-run (to add methodology):**
1. Sirius
2. Pleiades (also fixes Wikipedia violation)
3. Orion Light

**Not Yet Complete:**
4. Orion Dark
5. Andromeda
6. Lyra
7. Arcturus
8. Draco
9. Zeta Reticuli (needs prompt creation first)

### Priority 2: Create Documentation (6-8 hours)
- Create `METHODOLOGY.md` - Theoretical framework and research approach
- Create `BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` - Consolidated sources from all 9 JSONs

### Priority 3: Validation (2-4 hours)
Verify all 9 JSON files meet quality standards:
- Include methodology and academic_context fields
- 3-5 characteristics each with 5+ sources
- No Wikipedia/encyclopedia sources
- All sources have ISBNs, page numbers, quotes
- Disputed claims have counter-evidence

## Quality Target

**Current:** 7.5/10  
**Target:** 9/10

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Academic context documented
- ✅ Methodology fields in JSON
- ✅ Bibliography structure defined
- ⏳ Need to re-run research with enhanced prompts
- ⏳ Need to create METHODOLOGY.md and BIBLIOGRAPHY.md

## Template Reference

Use **Sirius baseline** as the gold standard template:
`lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/SIRIUS_BASELINE.txt`

All other prompts now match this structure.

# Steering Documentation Updates

**Date:** January 24, 2025  
**File Updated:** `.kiro/steering/product.md`

## What Was Added

### 1. Academic Foundation Section (Competitive Moat)
Added comprehensive explanation of Human Design's credible academic foundations:
- I Ching (3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement)
- 64 DNA codons (Nobel Prize research - verifiable mathematical correspondence)
- Kabbalah (extensive academic study)
- Chakra system (Religious Studies, Yoga Studies)
- Western Astrology (cultural/historical phenomenon)

**Key Framing:** "Contemporary mythology with academic-grade sourcing" NOT "scientifically proven predictions"

### 2. Research Standards
Documented our research quality standards:
- Ancient texts with named translators
- Published books with ISBNs and page numbers
- Academic papers from JSTOR, university repositories
- Evidence typing (direct/inferred/symbolic)
- Consensus levels documented
- Disputed claims include counter-evidence

### 3. Competitive Advantage
Explicitly stated: **No other astrology/mythology app can claim this level of research rigor or academic foundation.**

### 4. Updated Key Terminology
Added framing guidelines:
- ✅ "Comparative mythology research"
- ✅ "Contemporary mythology with academic-grade sourcing"
- ✅ "Pattern recognition", "archetypal mapping", "self-discovery tool"
- ❌ "Scientifically proven", "medical diagnosis", "predict the future"

### 5. Communication Guidelines
Added "Communicating Academic Credibility" section with:
- How to explain the system on the "Why" screen
- Tone guidelines ("confident but not arrogant")
- What NOT to say vs what TO say
- Emphasis on research quality without overpromising

## Why This Matters

**This is your competitive moat.** When users ask "Why should I trust this?", you can point to:
1. Human Design's I Ching foundation (3,000 years of scholarship)
2. Mathematical correspondence to genetic code (64 hexagrams = 64 codons)
3. Research standards that exceed typical astrology content
4. Proper citations, ancient texts, academic sources

**Marketing angle:** "The only star system sorter built on academic-grade research, not blog posts."

## Impact on Development

**When building the "Why" screen (Task 11):**
- Include a brief explanation of the I Ching → Human Design → Star System mapping
- Mention the 64 hexagrams = 64 codons correspondence
- Link to methodology documentation (Phase 2)
- Use the approved framing language

**When writing copy:**
- Reference the updated Key Terminology section
- Use "comparative mythology" framing
- Emphasize research quality
- Include legal disclaimer

**When marketing:**
- Lead with the academic foundation differentiator
- Emphasize the I Ching scholarship and Nobel Prize genetics connection
- Position as "contemporary mythology with academic rigor"

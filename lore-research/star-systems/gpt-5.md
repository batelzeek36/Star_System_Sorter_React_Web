Love that Claude is pushing you to do the star-system baselines first—that’s the right move. Here’s a compact, defensible “what we know (and what’s disputed)” snapshot you can hand to Comet as cross-check targets.

# Sirius (teacher/guardian archetype — partly supported, partly disputed)

- **Ancient/indigenous:** Sirius = Sopdet/Sothis in Egypt (linked to Isis and the Nile’s rising/almanacs), giving it a calendrical/renewal, priestly importance. ([Pyramid Texts Online](https://pyramidtextsonline.com/translation.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "English Translation of the Unas Pyramid Texts"))
    
- **Dogon tradition (contested):** Temple claims Nommo beings from Sirius taught the Dogon; later fieldwork (van Beek) and skeptics argue contamination by modern astronomy. Treat as disputed evidence, not “fact.” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirius_Mystery?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Sirius Mystery"))
    
- **Modern esoteric:** Law of One mentions benevolent visitors “such as are from Sirius,” and an entity from Sirius aiding twice—used in New Age circles to support a “guardian/teacher” motif. ([The Law of One](https://www.lawofone.info/results.php?q=fifth+dimension+entities&utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Law of One Search Results for 'fifth dimension entities'"))
    

# Pleiades (Seven Sisters / nurturing–artistic meme — strong cross-cultural support, esoteric overlay)

- **Cross-cultural core:** “Seven Sisters” myths (Greek, Aboriginal Australian, Japan’s Subaru, etc.) are globally pervasive; Aboriginal songlines explicitly feature pursuit myths. ([ATNF](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/colloquia/public/AboriginalAstronomy_50mins_CASS_2021May26.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Indigenous Astronomy and Navigation"))
    
- **Scholarly synthesis:** Recent work explores why so many cultures encode “seven” here (astronomy + myth). Use this to ground “ancient ubiquity,” then layer modern traits cautiously. ([Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/pleiades-constellation-origin-story.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "100000-year-old story could explain why the Pleiades are ..."))
    
- **Modern esoteric:** Marciniak/Hand Clow portray Pleiadians as creative, nurturing teacher-beings—good to cite as **modern** sources, not antiquity. ([Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/defending-sacred-ground-the-andromedan-compendium-1997-alex-collier?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Defending Sacred Ground; The Andromedan Compendium-Alex ..."))
    

# Orion Light / Osirian (order, kingship, rebirth, “mystery-school” vibe — strong Egyptian base)

- **Egyptian base:** Pyramid Texts equate Orion (Sah) with Osiris; pharaoh “ascends with Orion.” This gives an explicit “afterlife/rebirth/royal order” linkage. ([Giza Media](https://gizamedia.rc.fas.harvard.edu/documents/bauval_de_13_1989.pdf "Discussions in Egyptology 13, 1989"))
    
- **Architecture/astronomy:** Orion Correlation Theory (Bauval) argues the 3 Giza pyramids mirror Orion’s belt; useful culturally, though not universally accepted academically. ([Giza Media](https://gizamedia.rc.fas.harvard.edu/documents/bauval_de_13_1989.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Discussions in Egyptology 13, 1989"))
    
- **Hermetic/Thoth tie-ins:** Hermes/Thoth = wisdom/records; the **direct** Orion–Thoth link is interpretive. Keep it “inferred,” not explicit.
    

# Arcturus (healing/engineering/geometry — mainly modern esoteric)

- **Cayce tradition:** A.R.E. materials summarize Cayce’s view of Arcturus as a significant spiritual “school” or waypoint; direct verbatim lines are scattered—treat as **modern esoteric**, not ancient. ([Edgar Cayce's A.R.E.](https://content.edgarcayce.org/about-us/blog/blog-posts/interplanetary-sojourns/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interplanetary Sojourns"))
    
- **Channeling canon:** Norma Milanovich _We, the Arcturians_ and Tom Kenyon’s _Arcturian Anthology_ present healers/technologists/energy-geometry themes. Use as channeled sources. ([Libris](https://cdn4.libris.ro/userdocspdf/1409/We%20the%20arcturians%20rev%20e%20-%20Norma%20J.%20Milanovich.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "WE, THE ARCTURIANS - Norma J. Milanovich"))
    
- **Ancient anchors:** Sparse. You won’t find robust ancient “Arcturian healer” claims—mark “ancient support: low/unknown.”
    

# Andromeda (freedom/sovereignty/explorer meme — mostly modern contactee material)

- **Contactee literature:** Alex Collier’s _Defending Sacred Ground_ frames Andromedans around freedom/sovereignty themes; cite as **channeled/contactee**, not historical. ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Prism-Lyra-Exploration-Galactic-Heritage/dp/0963132008?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Prism of Lyra: An Exploration of Human Aalectic Heritage"))
    
- **Classical myth:** Andromeda the princess chained and freed by Perseus—use carefully as **symbolic** resonance, not a claim that ancients tied the constellation to ETs. ([Claudia Dawson](https://claudiadawson.blog/posts/book-highlights-the-prism-of-lyra-by-lyssa-royal?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Book highlights: The Prism of Lyra by Lyssa Royal"))
    

# Lyra (primordial/root race, feline beings — channeled consensus, little ancient)

- **Core modern text:** Lyssa Royal & Keith Priest’s _The Prism of Lyra_ positions Lyra as progenitor/root (“birth of humanoid family”). Use for trait language; mark “channeled/research-lite.” ([Dokumen](https://dokumen.pub/download/the-prism-of-lyra-an-exploration-of-human-galactic-heritage-1993-0963132008-0929385160.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Prism of Lyra : an exploration of human Galactic heritage"))
    
- **Feline motif:** “Lyran feline” appears widely in starseed lore; treat as modern spiritual narrative, not historical fact. ([Sacredlotus.eu](https://www.sacredlotus.eu/blogs/news/lyran-starseeds-the-feline-lineage-ancient-wisdom-from-the-stars?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Lyran Starseeds and the Cosmic Feline Legacy"))
    

# Draco (power/hierarchy/serpentine—mythic backbone + modern conspiracist overlay)

- **Ancient sky-myth:** Draco = dragon/serpent constellation; Thuban a former pole star; dragons symbolize power/order across cultures. Good as **mythic scaffold** only. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_%28constellation%29 "Draco (constellation) - Wikipedia"))
    
- **Modern lore:** “Draco reptilians” (Icke et al.) is highly controversial—use as **disputed modern** material, never as baseline “fact.” (You can cite Icke only to note the claim’s existence, not as evidence.)
    

# Zeta Reticuli (analyst/experimenter/Greys — modern UFO lore)

- **Astronomy:** Zeta Reticuli = nearby wide G-type binary ~39 ly; that’s the only stable “hard” fact here. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Reticuli?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Zeta Reticuli"))
    
- **UFO lore:** Betty & Barney Hill “star map” later matched (controversially) to Zeta Reticuli by Marjorie Fish; later analyses and Hipparcos parallax undercut the match—log as **disputed**. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_and_Betty_Hill_incident?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Barney and Betty Hill incident"))
    
- **Channeling:** “Bashar” material often bridges Greys/Zeta/Esassani—use clearly as **channeled**. (You can have Comet pull exact talk transcripts.)

## How to turn this into your baseline (fast)

Ask Comet to build one JSON per system like this (paste once, then swap `star_system`):

```json
{
  "star_system": "Sirius",
  "characteristics": [
    {
      "trait": "Teachers / guardians / wisdom-keepers",
      "consensus_level": "medium",
      "notes": "Ancient calendrical centrality (Egypt); Dogon ‘Nommo’ teaching lore is disputed; modern channeled/LOO supports ‘guardian’ idea.",
      "sources": [
        {"title":"Sopdet (Sothis) as Sirius; Isis association","author":"M. Ezz Ali","year":2017,"page":"pp. 5–12","url":"https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=75013","source_type":"research","quote":"Sopdet (Sothis) ... the star Sirius ... linked with the Nile inundation and Isis."},
        {"title":"The Sirius Mystery","author":"R. Temple","year":1976,"page":"ch. 3–4","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirius_Mystery","source_type":"research/controversial","quote":"Dogon... preserve a tradition of contact with beings from Sirius."},
        {"title":"Law of One (search: ‘Sirius’)","author":"L/L Research","year":1981,"page":"Session 21 & 6","url":"https://www.lawofone.info/s/Sirius","source_type":"channeled","quote":"Those such as are from Sirius are of this type."}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "disputed_points": [
    {"claim":"Dogon possessed ancient knowledge of Sirius B","counter_evidence":"van Beek (1991) found no support in Dogon fieldwork","sources":[{"title":"Dogon Restudied","author":"W. van Beek","year":1991,"url":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2743631","source_type":"research"}]}
  ]
}
```

Repeat for **Pleiades, Orion (Osirian), Arcturus, Andromeda, Lyra, Draco, Zeta Reticuli** with traits adjusted per the bullets above. Have Comet **(a)** fill exact page/section quotes (≤25 words), **(b)** grade consensus, and **(c)** tag each source as `ancient|research|channeled|indigenous|controversial`.

---

## Quick “what to tell Comet” guardrails

- **Label claims by source type** (ancient, indigenous, research, channeled) so you can weight them later.
    
- **Require 3+ sources per trait** (mix types).
    
- **Force quotes ≤25 words + page/section** (or “unknown”).
    
- **Mark consensus** only after at least two independent sources align (not both channeled).
    
- **Flag disputes explicitly** (Dogon/Sirius; Orion correlation theory; Hill map).

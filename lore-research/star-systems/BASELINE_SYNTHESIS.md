## Evidence Quality Framework

### Source Type Classification

Every citation must be tagged:
- **ancient:** Pre-1800s texts, indigenous oral traditions, archaeological evidence
- **research:** Academic papers, historical analysis, astronomical data
- **channeled:** Modern channeled material (post-1950s)
- **indigenous:** Oral traditions, songlines, tribal knowledge
- **controversial:** Disputed claims requiring counter-evidence notation

### Consensus Levels

- **HIGH:** 3+ independent sources, mixing ancient + modern, minimal disputes
- **MEDIUM:** 2-3 sources, or strong in one category (e.g., ancient only)
- **LOW:** Single source, or heavily disputed, or channeled-only

### Required Elements Per Trait

- Minimum 3 sources per trait
- Mix of source types (not all channeled)
- Direct quotes ≤25 words with page numbers
- Explicit dispute notation where applicable
- Ancient support level noted (high/medium/low/unknown)

## Star System Baselines

### 1. Sirius (Teachers & Guardians)

#### Core Traits
- Divine teachers / wisdom keepers
- Genetic engineers (Nommo tradition)
- Lawgivers, spiritual initiators
- Guardians of sacred knowledge
- Christos-type vibration

#### Evidence Quality
- **Ancient support:** HIGH (Egyptian Sopdet/Sothis, calendrical importance)
- **Modern support:** MEDIUM-HIGH (Law of One, channeled sources)
- **Disputed elements:** Dogon Nommo tradition (Temple vs. van Beek)

#### Expected Sources
- ✅ Pyramid Texts (ancient) - Sopdet/Isis linkage
- ✅ Law of One (channeled) - "benevolent visitors from Sirius"
- ⚠️ Temple "The Sirius Mystery" (controversial) - Dogon claims
- ⚠️ van Beek fieldwork (research) - Counter-evidence to Dogon claims

#### Research Guardrails
- Mark Dogon material as `disputed: true`
- Separate Egyptian calendrical role (solid) from ET contact claims (disputed)
- Require both ancient AND modern sources for "teacher" archetype

---

### 2. Pleiades (Nurturers & Artists)

#### Core Traits
- Emotional empaths and healers
- Artistic, sensual, aesthetic
- Feminine-coded (Yin, Venusian)
- Starseed origin point
- Spiritual midwives of awakening

#### Evidence Quality
- **Ancient support:** HIGH (Seven Sisters myths globally pervasive)
- **Modern support:** HIGH (Marciniak, Hand Clow, widespread channeling)
- **Disputed elements:** None major (ancient ubiquity is solid)

#### Expected Sources
- ✅ Aboriginal songlines (ancient/indigenous) - Seven Sisters pursuit myths
- ✅ Greek mythology (ancient) - Seven Sisters / Artemis
- ✅ Japanese Subaru (ancient/cultural) - Seven stars
- ✅ Marciniak "Bringers of the Dawn" (modern/channeled) - nurturing/artistic overlay

#### Research Guardrails
- Separate ancient "Seven Sisters ubiquity" (solid) from modern "nurturing/artistic" traits (channeled)
- Ancient = myth prevalence; Modern = personality overlay
- Both are valid but must be labeled by era

---

### 3. Orion Light / Osirian (Order & Mystery Schools)

#### Core Traits
- Record keepers / historians
- Spiritual strategists / system architects
- Carriers of sacred geometry
- Affiliated with Thoth / Hermes
- Oppose Orion "Dark" / Draco factions

#### Evidence Quality
- **Ancient support:** HIGH (Pyramid Texts, Orion = Osiris = rebirth/kingship)
- **Modern support:** MEDIUM (Hermetic texts, Bauval's correlation theory)
- **Disputed elements:** Orion Correlation Theory (culturally useful, not universally accepted)

#### Expected Sources
- ✅ Pyramid Texts (ancient) - "Pharaoh ascends with Orion (Sah)"
- ✅ Bauval "The Orion Mystery" (research/controversial) - Giza alignment
- ⚠️ Hermetic Corpus (ancient) - Thoth/Hermes wisdom (Orion link is inferred)

#### Research Guardrails
- Egyptian Orion-Osiris link is explicit and solid
- Thoth-Orion connection is `evidence_type: inferred` (not explicit)
- Bauval's architecture theory: mark as `disputed: false` but `consensus: medium`

---

### 4. Arcturus (Healers & Engineers)

#### Core Traits
- Energy healers
- Frequency-based consciousness
- Architects of advanced tech + sacred geometry
- Defenders of Earth's energy grids
- Dreamtime and sleep-state engineers

#### Evidence Quality
- **Ancient support:** LOW/UNKNOWN (sparse to none)
- **Modern support:** HIGH (Cayce, Milanovich, Kenyon, widespread channeling)
- **Disputed elements:** None (but lack of ancient support is notable)

#### Expected Sources
- ✅ Edgar Cayce readings (modern/channeled) - Arcturus as spiritual "school"
- ✅ Milanovich "We, the Arcturians" (modern/channeled) - healers/technologists
- ✅ Kenyon "Arcturian Anthology" (modern/channeled) - energy/geometry themes
- ❌ Ancient sources: None expected

#### Research Guardrails
- Explicitly note `ancient_support: low` or `unknown`
- All traits are modern/channeled - this is valid but must be labeled
- Do not claim ancient roots without evidence

---

### 5. Andromeda (Freedom & Sovereignty)

#### Core Traits
- Sovereignty / anti-control
- Galactic explorers, nomadic
- Non-hierarchical ethos
- Technically advanced yet tribal
- Often anti-interventionist

#### Evidence Quality
- **Ancient support:** LOW (Greek myth is symbolic only, not ET claim)
- **Modern support:** MEDIUM (Collier, Lyssa Royal, contactee literature)
- **Disputed elements:** None major (but almost entirely modern)

#### Expected Sources
- ✅ Collier "Defending Sacred Ground" (modern/contactee) - freedom/sovereignty themes
- ✅ Lyssa Royal works (modern/channeled) - explorer archetype
- ⚠️ Greek mythology (ancient) - Princess Andromeda freed by Perseus (symbolic resonance only)

#### Research Guardrails
- Greek myth is `evidence_type: symbolic` not `evidence_type: direct`
- Almost entirely modern contactee material - label accordingly
- Do not overstate ancient connections

---

### 6. Lyra (Primordial Root Race)

#### Core Traits
- Primordial humanoid root race
- Feline (or avian) ancestry
- Builders of early civilizations
- Refugees after war with Draco
- Carry "first template" consciousness

#### Evidence Quality
- **Ancient support:** LOW/UNKNOWN (little to none)
- **Modern support:** HIGH (Lyssa Royal, Dolores Cannon, starseed lore)
- **Disputed elements:** None (but lack of ancient support is notable)

#### Expected Sources
- ✅ Lyssa Royal "The Prism of Lyra" (modern/channeled) - progenitor/root race
- ✅ Dolores Cannon "The Three Waves" (modern/channeled) - starseed origins
- ✅ Starseed literature (modern/spiritual) - "Lyran feline" motif
- ❌ Ancient sources: None expected

#### Research Guardrails
- Explicitly note `ancient_support: unknown`
- "Feline beings" is modern spiritual narrative, not historical fact
- Label all sources as `source_type: channeled` or `modern`

---

### 7. Draco (Power & Hierarchy)

#### Core Traits
- Power, control, dominance
- Hierarchy and royalty
- Kundalini / serpentine force
- Genetic manipulators
- Often misunderstood or polarized as evil

#### Evidence Quality
- **Ancient support:** HIGH (dragon/serpent myths globally pervasive, Thuban pole star)
- **Modern support:** CONTROVERSIAL (Icke's reptilian claims highly disputed)
- **Disputed elements:** "Draco reptilians" conspiracy theories

#### Expected Sources
- ✅ Dragon mythology (ancient/cross-cultural) - power/wisdom symbolism
- ✅ Thuban as former pole star (research/astronomical) - Draco constellation
- ✅ Kundalini teachings (ancient) - serpent energy symbolism
- ⚠️ Icke "The Biggest Secret" (modern/controversial) - reptilian conspiracy (mark as disputed)

#### Research Guardrails
- Ancient dragon myths are solid as **mythic scaffold** only
- Icke material must be tagged `source_type: controversial` and `disputed: true`
- Separate ancient serpent symbolism (power/wisdom) from modern conspiracy theories
- Note: "Not all Draco are evil" - look for nuance in sources

---

### 8. Zeta Reticuli (Analysts & Experimenters)

#### Core Traits
- Emotionally detached intelligence
- Genetic researchers / experimenters
- Interdimensional abductors (neutral to negative)
- Timeline engineers
- Carry karmic debt from past implosions

#### Evidence Quality
- **Ancient support:** NONE (modern UFO lore only)
- **Modern support:** MEDIUM (Hill case, Bashar, abduction literature)
- **Disputed elements:** Hill star map match (undercut by later analysis)

#### Expected Sources
- ✅ Astronomical data (research/factual) - Zeta Reticuli binary system ~39 ly
- ⚠️ Betty & Barney Hill case (UFO lore/disputed) - star map controversy
- ⚠️ Marjorie Fish analysis (research/disputed) - later Hipparcos data undercuts match
- ✅ Bashar transcripts (modern/channeled) - Greys/Zeta/Essassani bridge

#### Research Guardrails
- Hill star map must be marked `disputed: true` with counter-evidence
- Only hard fact: Zeta Reticuli exists as a binary star system
- All ET claims are modern UFO lore - label accordingly
- Bashar material is `source_type: channeled`

## Red Flags for Comet Responses

Reject or re-prompt if you see:

### Critical Issues
- ❌ Dogon/Sirius claims without dispute notation
- ❌ Arcturus with claimed ancient support
- ❌ Lyra feline beings claimed as ancient
- ❌ Draco reptilians without controversy flag
- ❌ Hill star map without dispute notation
- ❌ Sources missing `source_type` tags
- ❌ HIGH consensus with <3 sources
- ❌ Quotes >25 words or missing page numbers

### Quality Issues
- ⚠️ All sources are channeled (need mix)
- ⚠️ Ancient support not noted
- ⚠️ Inferred connections not marked
- ⚠️ Symbolic resonance treated as direct evidence
- ⚠️ Modern overlay not separated from ancient core

---

## Validation Workflow

When you receive Comet's baseline research:

1. **Compare traits** - Do they match this synthesis?
2. **Check source types** - Are they properly labeled?
3. **Validate disputes** - Are controversial claims marked?
4. **Assess consensus** - Does it match evidence quality?
5. **Review ancient support** - Is it noted and accurate?
6. **Scan for red flags** - Any critical issues?

If quality is low, re-prompt with stricter requirements from this document.

## Next Steps

1. Generate 8 Comet prompts (one per star system) using the template above
2. Run Comet research for each system
3. Validate results against this synthesis
4. Accept only responses meeting all quality standards
5. Compile validated baselines into Phase 0 foundation
6. Proceed to Phase 1 (gate research) only after Phase 0 is solid

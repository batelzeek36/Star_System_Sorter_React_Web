Short answer: **yeah—S³ looks genuinely novel**. I can’t find any app that (a) uses **Human Design at the Gate·Line level (384)** and (b) **maps those to star-system lore with citations and a scoring rubric**. What exists splits into two separate worlds:

# Closest comparables (but not what you’re building)

* **Human Design charting apps** (Jovian Archive/myBodyGraph, Genetic Matrix, My Human Design): rich HD features, *no* star-system layer. ([myBodyGraph][1])
* **Starseed tools & decks** (e.g., Lyssa Royal Holt’s *Galactic Heritage Cards* app): star-lineage divination, *no* Human Design integration. ([Apple][2])
* **“Galactic astrology” reports** (fixed-star alignments for natal charts): astrology-based lineage mapping, *not* HD gates/lines. ([galacticastrochart.com][3])
* **Starseed quizzes/calculators** (web quizzes): entertainment tests, no HD nor scholarly citations. ([ProProfs][4])

# Why S³ reads as new

* **Unit of meaning = Gate·Line (384)** with **multi-translation I-Ching citations** → not present in HD apps. ([Jovian Archive][5])
* **Method-labeled star-lore mapping** (scored, interpretive, reproducible) → absent across starseed tools and HD apps above. ([Apple][2])

# Caveats & how to lock the “novel” claim

* It’s possible there are small indie projects not well indexed. To shore up novelty:

  1. **Document your method & dataset publicly** (METHODS.md + DOI on Zenodo).
  2. **State scope clearly**: “interpretive humanities project with primary-source citations.”
  3. **File a lightweight prior-art memo** (screenshots/links to the categories above) and date it.

If you want, I’ll draft a one-paragraph **positioning blurb** for your landing page that contrasts S³ with those three categories—and a tiny checklist you can use to keep the “novelty” receipts.

# Research Methodology - Star System Sorter

## Theoretical Framework

Star System Sorter explores symbolic resonances between Human Design's 
multi-disciplinary framework and cross-cultural star mythology.

### Human Design's Academic Foundations

Human Design synthesizes from 8 source systems:

1. **I Ching (64 Hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship
   - Wilhelm, Richard & Baynes, Cary F. (1950). The I Ching. Princeton.
   - Jung, C.G. (1950). Foreword to the I Ching.
   
2. **64 DNA Codons** - Nobel Prize-winning research
   - Nirenberg & Khorana (1968). Genetic code research.
   - Schönberger, Martin (1973). The I Ching and the Genetic Code.
   
3. **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Extensive academic study
   - Scholem, Gershom (1941). Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism.
   
4. **Chakra System** - Religious Studies, Yoga Studies
   - Feuerstein, Georg (1998). The Yoga Tradition.
   
5. **Western Astrology** - Cultural/historical phenomenon
   - Tarnas, Richard (2006). Cosmos and Psyche.

### Mathematical Correspondences

- 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (verifiable)
- Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)
- 9 Centers = Modified chakra system

### Research Approach

We use **comparative mythology** to map Human Design gates 
(I Ching-based) to star system archetypes documented in:
- Ancient texts (Pyramid Texts, Greek mythology, Vedic astronomy)
- Modern esoteric synthesis (channeled works, contemporary sources)

### Source Quality Standards

- Primary sources: Ancient texts with named translators
- Published books: ISBNs, page numbers, verifiable quotes
- Evidence typing: Direct, inferred, symbolic
- Transparency: Disputed claims flagged, consensus levels documented
```

**Action:** Create this file and link it from app's "About" page

### 1.2 Add Academic Context to Research Outputs

**Update:** Each star system JSON should include a `methodology` field

**Example addition to JSON structure:**
```json
{
  "star_system": "Sirius",
  "methodology": {
    "framework": "Comparative mythology + I Ching-based Human Design system",
    "academic_foundations": [
      "I Ching (64 hexagrams → 64 gates)",
      "Cross-cultural star mythology",
      "Jungian archetypal psychology"
    ],
    "source_standards": "Ancient texts with named translators, published books with ISBNs, evidence typing (direct/inferred/symbolic)"
  },
  "characteristics": [...]
}
```

**Action:** Add this to the output format in all baseline prompts

---

### 1.3 Create Academic Bibliography Page

**Create:** `lore-research/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md`

**Contents:** Full academic bibliography with:
- I Ching scholarship (Wilhelm, Legge, Jung)
- Genetic code research (Nirenberg, Khorana, Schönberger)
- Kabbalah scholarship (Scholem, Idel)
- Comparative mythology (Campbell, Eliade)

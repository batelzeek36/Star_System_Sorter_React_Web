Human Design is a **synthesis system** — it pulls from multiple ancient and modern frameworks. Here's the **complete list** of core components integrated into Human Design:

---

## 🧬 Human Design: Source Systems Breakdown

### 1. 🈴 **I Ching** (Book of Changes)

- **64 Hexagrams** form the backbone of the **Gate system**
    
- Provides the **binary code logic** and **archetypal themes**
    
- Core source of the **mutation sequence** and energetic evolution
    

### 2. 🌌 **Western Astrology**

- The **planetary positions** at the time of birth + ~88 days prior (Design Date) determine **Gate activations**
    
- Each planet's position overlays onto the **I Ching wheel**
    
- Introduces **12 zodiac signs**, **planets as archetypal forces**
    

### 3. 🕍 **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)**

- Provides the **structural framework** that influenced the **channel system**
    
- The **22 connections** between Sephiroth loosely correspond to the **36 channels** in Human Design
    
- Focused on **pathways of divine energy** flowing through creation
    

### 4. 🧘🏽 **Chakra System (Eastern Yogic)**

- Modified into the **9-Center system** (vs. 7 chakras)
    
- Influences the concept of **Centers** in Human Design: Head, Ajna, Throat, etc.
    
- Each Center is treated as a **binary open/closed processor** of life force
    

### 5. 🔬 **Quantum Physics**

- Provides the **theoretical model** for how neutrinos carry information
    
- The **Neutrino Stream** is said to imprint genetic data at birth and conception
    
- Frames the body as a **frequency receiver/transmitter**

## 🧠 Additional Influences (Less Central but Present)

### 6. 🧬 **Genetics / DNA Coding**

- 64 I Ching hexagrams = **64 codons** in DNA
    
- Gates map to **genetic archetypes**
    
- Core foundation of the **Gene Keys** system (by Richard Rudd)
    

### 7. 📐 **Biochemistry / Psychology**

- The **BodyGraph** overlays **biological systems** (e.g. spleen = immune system, solar plexus = emotions)
    
- Influences **decision-making authority** and internal awareness
    
- Some elements influenced by **Jungian typology** and behavioral energetics
    

### 8. 🧙🏽‍♂️ **Mystical Transmission**

- The system was “received” by **Ra Uru Hu** in 1987 during a mystical 8-day experience (“The Voice”)
    
- Not a traditional academic synthesis — part of its power lies in its **revelatory origin**

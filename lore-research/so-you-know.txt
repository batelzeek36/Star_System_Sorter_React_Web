The only thing NOT in these prompts (but you already have):

✅ Lore compiler - Already built (scripts/compile-lore.ts)
✅ Scorer algorithm - Already built (src/lib/scorer.ts)
✅ UI components - Already built (WhyScreen, DossierScreen, etc.)
✅ Source registry - You'll build this as you go (data/lore/sources.yaml)


The Complete Workflow
Comet → Returns 3 JSONs (A, B, C)
You → Send JSONs to me
Me (Claude) → Merge JSONs → Generate YAML rules
Compiler → Validates rules (npm run compile:lore)
You → Test with your HD chart (npm run classify)
Commit → Add to lore database

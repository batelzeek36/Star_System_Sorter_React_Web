## üéØ Project Overview

Star System Sorter (S¬≥) maps Human Design gates to star system archetypes through rigorous comparative mythology research.

### Our Competitive Moat

**No other astrology/mythology app can claim:**
- I Ching foundation (3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement)
- Mathematical correspondence to genetic code (64 hexagrams = 64 DNA codons)
- Rigorous sourcing (ancient texts with ISBNs, proper citations)
- Humanities-grade academic standards

**This is NOT pseudoscience** - it's a contemporary interpretive synthesis built on academically documented foundations.

## üéì Academic Standards

### Language Guidelines

**‚úÖ Use:**
- "Contemporary interpretive synthesis"
- "Mythopoetic mapping"
- "Comparative mythology research"
- "Pattern recognition tool"

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- "Scientifically proven"
- "Empirical correlation"
- "Quantum physics validates"
- "Predictive system"

### Citation Requirements

**All sources must include:**
- Full title, author, edition
- Publication year
- Specific page/section numbers
- Direct quotes (‚â§25 words)
- URLs where available
- Source type

**I Ching sources must include:**

## üîç Key Insights

### Gate.Line is Emergent
**39.3 ‚â† Gate 39 + Line 3**  
**39.3 = Its own frequency**

Like chemistry: H + O have properties, but H‚ÇÇO is different.

### Research Methodology
1. I Ching line text as root source
2. HD structural context
3. Phenomenology (shadow/gift)
4. Star system scoring (4 factors)
5. Separate data from interpretation

### Scoring Rubric
- I Ching match (35%)
- HD structural (35%)
- Phenomenology (20%)
- Lore coherence (10%)

See [strategy/UNIFIED_GATE_LINE_STRATEGY.md](strategy/UNIFIED_GATE_LINE_STRATEGY.md) for complete methodology.

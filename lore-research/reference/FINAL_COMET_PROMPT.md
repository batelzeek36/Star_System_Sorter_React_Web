# Final Comet Prompt - Complete Research Template

## Copy/Paste This Prompt for Each Gate

```
Research Human Design Gate {GATE_NUM} with comprehensive ancient wisdom and star system connections.

CONTEXT:
I'm building a classification system that maps Human Design gates to 8 star systems based on ancient wisdom and esoteric lore:

STAR SYSTEMS:
- Sirius (teachers, guardians, Sirian-Christos lineage, Dogon knowledge)
- Pleiades (nurturers, artists, empaths, Seven Sisters across all cultures)
- Orion Light/Osirian (strategists, historians, Egyptian mystery schools, Thoth/Hermes lineage)
- Arcturus (engineers, healers, geometric consciousness, energy work)
- Andromeda (explorers, iconoclasts, freedom, sovereignty)
- Lyra (primordial builders, feline beings, instinct, root race)
- Draco (power, will, hierarchy, kundalini - disputed/shadow)
- Zeta Reticuli (analysts, experimenters, detachment, Greys/Bashar)

RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS:

1. HUMAN DESIGN FOUNDATION
   - Find Gate {GATE_NUM}'s traditional meaning from Ra Uru Hu
   - Find Gene Keys interpretation (Richard Rudd)
   - Note the I Ching hexagram parallel (Hexagram {GATE_NUM})
   - Identify core archetype, shadow, gift, siddhi

2. ANCIENT WISDOM PARALLELS
   Search for archetypal connections in:
   
   EGYPTIAN/THOTHIAN:
   - Emerald Tablets of Thoth (Billy Carson)
   - Egyptian Book of the Dead
   - Pyramid Texts
   - Hermetic Corpus (Hermes Trismegistus)
   
   CHINESE/TAOIST:
   - I Ching Hexagram {GATE_NUM} (CRITICAL - direct parallel!)
   - Tao Te Ching themes
   - Yellow Emperor's Classic (if health/energy related)
   
   VEDIC/HINDU:
   - Rig Veda concepts
   - Bhagavad Gita archetypes
   - Upanishads (consciousness themes)
   
   INDIGENOUS:
   - Hopi prophecies and star lore
   - Dogon Sirius knowledge
   - Aboriginal Dreamtime (Seven Sisters)
   - Cherokee/Mayan star teachings
   
   GREEK/MYSTERY SCHOOLS:
   - Orphic Hymns
   - Platonic dialogues
   - Pythagorean teachings (if geometry/number related)
   
   SUMERIAN/MESOPOTAMIAN:
   - Enuma Elish
   - Epic of Gilgamesh
   - Sumerian King List

3. STAR SYSTEM ALIGNMENTS
   For each potential star system, find:
   
   EXPLICIT CONNECTIONS (search for):
   - "Gate {GATE_NUM} [star system name]"
   - "[Gate archetype] [star system] frequency"
   - Direct mentions in channeled material
   
   THEMATIC CONNECTIONS (look for):
   - Does the gate's archetype match star system signature?
   - Do ancient texts describing this archetype mention stars?
   - Are there cross-cultural patterns pointing to same system?
   
   ANCIENT TEXT CONNECTIONS (search for):
   - Egyptian texts mentioning Sirius/Orion + this archetype
   - I Ching hexagram themes + star lore
   - Indigenous star origin stories + this pattern
   - Vedic stellar deities + this quality

4. MODERN ESOTERIC SOURCES
   - Law of One (Ra Material) - search all sessions
   - Pleiadian channeling (Marciniak, Hand Clow)
   - Arcturian material
   - Lyran/Andromedan (Lyssa Royal, Alex Collier)
   - Bashar (Darryl Anka) for Zeta perspective
   - Robert Temple (Sirius Mystery)
   - Graham Hancock, Robert Bauval (ancient astronomy)

5. CROSS-CULTURAL SYNTHESIS
   Look for patterns like:
   - Same archetype appears in multiple ancient cultures
   - Multiple cultures associate this pattern with same stars
   - Ancient astronomical alignments related to this theme
   - Universal symbols or myths connected to this energy

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Return JSON only (no markdown, no commentary before/after)
2. Search BOTH ancient texts AND modern esoteric sources
3. I Ching Hexagram {GATE_NUM} is MANDATORY - always include
4. Mark confidence honestly:
   - high = Multiple primary sources + ancient text support
   - medium = 2+ sources OR strong thematic + ancient parallel
   - low = Single source OR weak thematic
   - speculative = Pure inference, mark disputed: true
5. Distinguish evidence types:
   - explicit = Direct mention in source
   - thematic = Archetype matches system signature
   - cross_cultural = Same pattern in 3+ cultures
   - inferred = Logical deduction
6. Include at least 3 sources per alignment (mix ancient + modern)
7. Keep quotes ≤25 words for fair use
8. If uncertain, write "unknown" rather than guess
9. Highlight "mind-blowing" connections (Dogon Sirius, pyramid alignments, etc.)
10. For Orion, specify "Orion Light" or "Osirian" (not just "Orion")

SEARCH STRATEGY:
Step 1: Find HD/Gene Keys meaning
Step 2: Find I Ching Hexagram {GATE_NUM} parallel
Step 3: Search ancient texts for archetype
Step 4: Search modern esoteric for star connections
Step 5: Look for cross-cultural patterns
Step 6: Synthesize into star system alignments

Now research Gate {GATE_NUM}.

Yes. I'll give you an acquisition list by star system.

How to use this:

* Treat each bullet as "go get this PDF / physical copy."
* These are the books/texts you want to actually ingest into Phase 2 so we can pull page-locked quotes later.
* I’m giving you a short note on *why* each source matters for that system.

The 8 systems (your canon):
**Sirius, Pleiades, Orion Light / Osirian, Arcturus, Andromeda, Lyra, Draco, Zeta Reticuli.**

---

## 1. SIRIUS

This system is your backbone: teachers, law, initiation, Nile flood.

**Ancient / scholarly**

* **"The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts"** – translated by R. O. Faulkner, Oxford University Press, 1969.
  Why: Sopdet/Sothis (Sirius) shows up linked to Isis, kingship resurrection, fertility, and the heliacal rising that starts the Nile flood and the Egyptian new year (Faulkner 1969).
* **"The Ancient Egyptian Coffin Texts"** – translated by R. O. Faulkner, Aris & Phillips, 1973–1978.
  Why: Coffin Text spells keep treating Sothis as an active goddess who speaks and guides after death, which supports "initiator/guide of souls" (Faulkner 1973).
* **"The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of Going Forth by Day"** – translated by R. O. Faulkner, University of Texas Press, rev. ed. 1990.
  Why: Isis explicitly identified with Sothis/Sirius in some spells; this ties Sirius to divine feminine protection and ritual passage (Faulkner 1990).
* **"Egyptian Astronomical Texts" Vol. I–III** – Otto Neugebauer & Richard A. Parker, Brown Univ. Press, 1960s.
  Why: Technical documentation of star calendars and heliacal risings, including Sothis; helps you lock astronomy claims to ritual timing (Neugebauer & Parker 1960s).
* **"Tir/Tishtrya (Tishtrya Yasht / Tir Yasht)" in *The Zend-Avesta, Part II: The Sîrôzahs, Yasts, and Nyâyis*** – translated by James Darmesteter, Oxford/Clarendon for Sacred Books of the East vol. 23, 1883.
  Why: In Zoroastrian tradition the star Tishtrya is a divine rain-bringer who battles drought; modern Iranology links Tishtrya to the visible Sirius, giving you an Indo-Iranian parallel to "life-giver of waters" (Darmesteter 1883; Boyce 1975).

**Esoteric / channeled / modern mystery**

* **"The Secret Doctrine"** – Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, Theosophical Publishing, 1888.
  Why: She frames Sirius as the "Great Instructor of mankind," basically the cosmic teacher node. This is one of the earliest occult-attributed "Sirius = higher initiatory lodge" takes (Blavatsky 1888).
* **"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire"** – Alice A. Bailey, Lucis Publishing, 1925.
  Why: Positions Sirius as the source of higher mind (manas) and the training ground of spiritual rulers / hierarchy (Bailey 1925).
* **"Esoteric Astrology"** – Alice A. Bailey, Lucis Publishing, 1951.
  Why: Explicit quote-level material that Earth’s spiritual hierarchy is "under the supervision... of Sirius." This supports "lawgivers / initiators" (Bailey 1951).
* **"The Sirius Mystery: New Scientific Evidence of Alien Contact 5,000 Years Ago"** – Robert K. G. Temple, St. Martin’s / later Destiny Books anniversary editions, 1976 / 1998+.
  Why: Connects the Dogon Nommo (amphibious teachers) to Sirius, claims tech/genetic uplift. This is the core "genetic engineer" claim you’re scoring as disputed (Temple 1976).
* **"Dogon Restudied: A Field Evaluation of the Work of Marcel Griaule"** – Walter E. A. van Beek, *Current Anthropology*, Vol. 32 No. 2, 1991.
  Why: Direct academic counter to Temple/Dogon Sirius B lore. You need this to score consensus level and attach “disputed = true” (van Beek 1991).

You 100% want PDFs/scans of all of those for Sirius.

## 2. PLEIADES

Theme set: nurturing, empathic, artistic, “Seven Sisters,” plus a TON of direct indigenous myth.

**Anthropology / myth / academic**

* **"The Seven Sisters of the Pleiades: Stories from around the World"** – Munya Andrews, Spinifex Press, 2004.
  Why: Cross-cultural indigenous accounts of the Pleiades as ancestral women / teachers / law-givers; gives you Aboriginal Australia, Native American, etc., all in one place (Andrews 2004).
* **"Works and Days"** – Hesiod, 7th c. BCE, Loeb Classical Library translation (e.g. Glenn W. Most, Harvard University Press).
  Why: Hesiod talks about agricultural timing using the rising and setting of the Pleiades; this gives you an ancient Greek "Pleiades = seasonal guidance / survival calendar" anchor (Hesiod, Loeb ed. 2006).
* **"Star Gods of the Maya: Astronomy in Art, Folklore, and Calendars"** – Susan Milbrath, Univ. of Texas Press, 1999.
  Why: Not purely Pleiades, but includes Mesoamerican sky-beings and calendrical star clusters; useful for “Pleiades = timing, ceremony, agricultural order” in the Americas (Milbrath 1999).

**Esoteric / channeled**

* **"Bringers of the Dawn: Teachings from the Pleiadians"** – Barbara Marciniak, Bear & Company, 1992.
  Why: Defines the Pleiadians as a consciousness collective teaching emotional awakening, DNA activation, and stewardship of Earth (Marciniak 1992).
* **"The Pleiadian Agenda: A New Cosmology for the Age of Light"** – Barbara Hand Clow, Bear & Company, 1995.
  Why: Gives cosmology, multidimensional politics, Earth grid stuff, and frames Pleiadians as mentors for human evolution (Hand Clow 1995).
* **"Prism of Lyra: An Exploration of Human Galactic Heritage"** – Lyssa Royal & Keith Priest, Light Technology Publishing, 1990.
  Why: Outlines a lineage tree where humans have Pleiadian input; super relevant to your “heritage mapping” logic (Royal & Priest 1990).

Grab Andrews 2004 and Marciniak 1992 first.

## 3. ORION LIGHT / OSIRIAN

This is your “priest-king resurrection / mystery school / lawful order” current, which ties Osiris, Horus, and the Orion belt alignment narrative.

**Egyptology / archaeo-astronomy**

* **"The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts"** – R. O. Faulkner, 1969.
  Why: Osiris as the resurrected king, ascent to the circumpolar stars and Orion; we need those utterances for “Orion = path of resurrection / royal afterlife” (Faulkner 1969).
* **"The Ancient Egyptian Coffin Texts"** – R. O. Faulkner, 1973–78.
  Why: Expands on the journey of the deceased to join Osiris and navigate the sky; again ties rulership/initiation to Orion imagery (Faulkner 1973).
* **"The Egyptian Book of the Dead: The Book of Going Forth by Day"** – Faulkner, 1990 rev.
  Why: Ritual map of the underworld, Osiris as judge/initiator. You’ll mine this for “Orion = initiatory gate / judgment / rebirth” (Faulkner 1990).

**Esoteric / alt-archaeology**

* **"The Orion Mystery: Unlocking the Secrets of the Pyramids"** – Robert Bauval & Adrian Gilbert, Crown, 1994.
  Why: Pyramids of Giza lined up with Orion’s Belt; proposes that the Giza complex is a rebirth machine keyed to Orion/Osiris (Bauval & Gilbert 1994).
* **"The Temple of Man"** – R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, Inner Traditions (English 1998, originally 1950s French).
  Why: Esoteric Egypt. Heavy on initiation, sacred proportions, cosmic priesthood. Helps you encode “Orion Light” as high initiatory science rather than just tomb cult (Schwaller de Lubicz 1998).

Get Bauval & Gilbert 1994 because it's constantly cited in Orion-mystery discussions and you’ll want to either use or explicitly rebut it.

## 4. ARCTURUS

Arcturus shows up as healer / technologist / stabilizer in most galactic lore, and as an important navigational/seasonal star historically.

**Historical / classical astronomy**

* **"Almagest"** – Claudius Ptolemy, 2nd century CE; English translation by G. J. Toomer, Duckworth, 1984.
  Why: Catalogs Arcturus (α Boötis) as one of the brightest stars; gives legit ancient recognition and location in Boötes (Ptolemy 2nd c. CE / Toomer 1984).
* **"Tetrabiblos"** – Claudius Ptolemy, transl. F. E. Robbins, Loeb, Harvard University Press, 1940.
  Why: Classical astrological attributions of major stars like Arcturus; useful to argue “Arcturus = influence / guidance / protection” in pre-modern astrology (Ptolemy 1940).

**Channeled / ET contact**

* **"We, The Arcturians"** – Norma J. Milanovich (with Betty Rice, Cynthia Ploski), Athena Publishing, 1990.
  Why: Core New Age framing of Arcturians as advanced healers / engineers / planetary medics (Milanovich 1990).
* **"Connecting with the Arcturians"** – David K. Miller, Light Technology Publishing, 2012.
  Why: Builds Arcturus as a multidimensional council helping Earth through frequency work and grid repair (Miller 2012).
* **"The Arcturian Corridor"** – Suzanne Lie (Dr. Sue Lie), Multidimensional Publishing, ~2010s.
  Why: Journey/activation material, soul-level tech upgrade narrative tied to Arcturian guidance (Lie ~2010s).

Milanovich 1990 is the must-own text for Arcturus in galactic-civilization lore pre-2000.

---

## 5. ANDROMEDA

Andromedan material is usually about sovereignty, deprogramming control systems, anti-empire. Almost all of it is channeled / contactee.

**Contactee / channeled**

* **"Defending Sacred Ground: The Andromedan Compendium"** – Alex Collier, self-published circulation, 1990s.
  Why: Claims direct contact with Andromedans, frames them as anti-control, pro-liberation, heavy on galactic politics (Collier 1990s).
* **"Letters from Andromeda"** – Alex Collier, newsletter compilations mid-late 1990s.
  Why: Expands the same sovereignty / anti-imperial governance themes. This is where “Andromedan Council” structure is fleshed out (Collier 1990s).
* **"Andromedan Messages"** – (various channelers in the 1990s/2000s, often published via small ET contact presses).
  Why: Repeats core beats: “your governments lie,” “claim your spiritual autonomy,” “refuse domination.”

**Astronomy / context**

* **"The Andromeda Galaxy"** – Sidney van den Bergh, Scientific American Library, 1976.
  Why: Gives you clean, non-channeled astronomy of M31, distance, spiral structure. You’ll use this to ground Andromeda in physical space and not just “council said so” (van den Bergh 1976).

For Andromeda, Collier’s “Defending Sacred Ground” is your anchor because people will absolutely ask, “where did this sovereignty narrative come from?”

---

## 6. LYRA

Lyra is where most “galactic origin / Lyran wars / feline progenitors / seeding of humans” lore comes from.

**Channeled / ET anthropology**

* **"Prism of Lyra: An Exploration of Human Galactic Heritage"** – Lyssa Royal & Keith Priest, Light Technology Publishing, 1990.
  Why: Lays out the big lineage map: Lyrans → Pleiadians → Earth humans. This is foundational for any “you’re from X star family” reading (Royal & Priest 1990).
* **"Visitors from Within"** – Lyssa Royal & Keith Priest, Granite Publishing, 1992.
  Why: Extends the contact taxonomy and motives of different species lines; often cross-referenced with Lyra/Pleiades origin lines (Royal & Priest 1992).
* **"The Lyran Connection"** – early ’90s lectures / transcripts attributed to Bashar (channeled by Darryl Anka).
  Why: Talks about Lyran diaspora and early interstellar colonization; useful for your “Lyran = primordial builder/migrant” trait (Anka 1990s).

**Mythic resonance / feline gods**

* **"The Gods of Eden"** – William Bramley, Avon Books, 1989.
  Why: Not explicitly “Lyra,” but it argues ancient human history was managed by off-world controllers framed as “gods,” which you can map onto Lyran/early empire narratives (Bramley 1989).

Priority grab is "Prism of Lyra" (1990). That’s your canonical Lyra source.

---

## 7. DRACO

This is usually coded as hierarchy, conquest, serpent/dragon power structures. You’ll need both mythic dragon material (classical) and modern “reptilian empire” material.

**Classical / mythic**

* **"The Library (Bibliotheca)"** – Pseudo-Apollodorus, 1st-2nd c. CE, Loeb Classical Library translation (James G. Frazer 1921 or newer).
  Why: Describes the dragon/serpent guardians like Ladon (which gets associated with Draco in later star lore). This is your ancient “dragon in the sky = guardian of power” seed (Apollodorus 2nd c. CE / Frazer 1921).
* **"Almagest"** – Ptolemy, Toomer 1984.
  Why: Lists Draco constellation as fixed stars of the northern sky; that’s how you tie “Draco” to an actual astronomical construct, not just conspiracy (Ptolemy 2nd c. CE / Toomer 1984).

**Esoteric / conspiracy / contact**

* **"The Biggest Secret"** – David Icke, Bridge of Love Publications, 1999.
  Why: This is the mainstream-popularized “reptilian overlord” narrative linking ruling bloodlines to Draco-type beings (Icke 1999).
* **"The Terra Papers"** – Robert Morning Sky, circa 1990s underground circulation.
  Why: Frames an interstellar war/history with reptilian/Draco empires dominating humans; often cited in starseed circles as Draco backstory (Morning Sky 1990s).
* **"Gods of Eden"** – William Bramley, 1989.
  Why: Again, not explicitly “Draco,” but gives you a proto-control narrative where humanity is farmed by a manipulative off-world faction. You can map that faction into your Draco archetype later (Bramley 1989).

You’ll definitely want Icke 1999 and Bramley 1989 on file just so you can document and flag “this is controversial / high-control / domination archetype.”

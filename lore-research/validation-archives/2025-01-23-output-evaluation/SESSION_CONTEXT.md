# Session Context - Output Validation Analysis

**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Current Step:** Awaiting 8 model responses for citation fact-checking

---

## Project Overview

**Star System Sorter** - Web app that maps Human Design gates to star system archetypes using a rigorous three-pass research methodology.

---

## What We've Completed

### Phase 1: Template Validation (DONE ✅)

**What:** Validated the research methodology templates (Pass A, B, C) with 8 AI models

**Models Used:** GPT-5 Pro (failed), GPT-5 ChatGPT, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1 (partial), Grok Fast, Grok 0709, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Perplexity Sonar

**Results:**
- 5/6 complete responses rated templates **3.5-4.5/5**
- Consensus: Methodology is sound, needs minor enhancements
- Main concern: AI citation hallucination risk

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Added Comet execution requirement to all templates
- ✅ Softened "unknown = failure" policy
- ✅ Added contradiction tracking to quality checks
- ✅ Added source tier system to Pass C (ancient/scholarly/historical/channeled/modern)
- ✅ Updated all three templates with enhancements

**Files:**
- Responses: `lore-research/validation-archives/2025-01-23-template-evaluation/responses/`
- Analysis: `lore-research/validation-archives/2025-01-23-template-evaluation/analysis/CONSENSUS_MATRIX.md`
- Updates: `lore-research/prompts/TEMPLATE_UPDATES_2025-01-23.md`

## Current Phase: Output Validation (IN PROGRESS 🔄)

### What We're Doing

**Validating Gate 1 research outputs** with 8 web-enabled AI models that can fact-check citations.

**Prompt Used:** `lore-research/prompts/Beam/these/OUTPUT_EVALUATION_BEAM.md`

**What's Being Evaluated:**
- Gate 1 Pass A output: `lore-research/research-outputs/gate-1/gate-1-pass-a.json`
- Gate 1 Pass B output: `lore-research/research-outputs/gate-1/gate-1-pass-b.json`
- Gate 1 Pass C output: `lore-research/research-outputs/gate-1/gate-1-pass-c.json`

### Models Being Used (All with Web Access)

1. **Sonar Deep Research** - Perplexity with Comet browser
2. **GPT-5 Search API** - OpenAI with web search
3. **o3 Deep Research** - OpenAI o3 deep research mode
4. **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Google with web search
5. **Grok 4 Fast Reasoning** - xAI with web access
6. **Sonar Pro** - Perplexity with search
7. **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking)** - Anthropic extended reasoning
8. **GPT-5** - OpenAI standard

### What Models Will Verify

**Citation Accuracy:**
- ✅ Do quoted sources actually exist online?
- ✅ Are page numbers accurate?
- ✅ Do quotes match the source material?
- ✅ Do URLs work?

**Content Quality:**
- Are thematic connections logical?
- Are confidence levels justified?
- Are source types properly categorized?

**Specific Citations to Check:**

**Pass A (3 citations):**
- Ra Uru Hu's "The Complete Rave I'Ching"
- Richard Rudd's "Gene Keys"
- Wilhelm/Baynes I Ching translation

**Pass B (6 citations):**
- I Ching Hexagram 1
- Orphic Hymns (Thomas Taylor)
- Rig Veda 10:129
- Tao Te Ching Chapter 1
- Plato's Timaeus
- Hopi Creation Story

**Pass C (6 citations):**
- Alice Bailey "Initiation, Human and Solar" (2 quotes)
- Robert Temple "The Sirius Mystery"
- Barbara Marciniak "Bringers of the Dawn" (2 quotes)
- Lyssa Royal "The Prism of Lyra"

**Total: 15 citations to verify**

✅ **Analysis templates prepared** - Ready to fill out once responses are in

### What's Pending

⏳ **User is pasting 8 model responses** into the response files

---

## Next Steps (Once Responses Are In)

1. **Read all 8 responses** from the response files
2. **Fill out Citation Verification Matrix**
   - Mark which citations each model verified (✅/⚠️/❌/🔒)
   - Calculate verification rates
   - Identify problematic citations
3. **Fill out Consensus Summary**
   - Extract ratings from each model
   - Identify consensus strengths/weaknesses
   - Determine production readiness
4. **Fill out Corrections Needed**
   - List citations that need fixing
   - Prioritize by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Estimate time to fix
5. **Provide final verdict**
   - Are Gate 1 outputs production-ready?
   - What needs to be fixed?
   - Lessons learned for remaining 63 gates

---

## Key Context

### Why This Matters

This is the **real test** of whether the research methodology produces verifiable, defensible outputs. If citations hold up to fact-checking, the methodology is validated. If not, we know what needs fixing.

### Success Criteria

**Pass:** 80%+ of citations verified by 4+ models  
**Conditional Pass:** 60-80% verified, with clear path to fix issues  
**Fail:** <60% verified, major methodology problems

### Important Notes

- First validation (template evaluation) was about **methodology design**
- This validation (output evaluation) is about **execution quality**
- Models have web access to actually verify citations
- This is more rigorous than the first validation

## What to Tell the New Session

"I need you to analyze 8 AI model responses that fact-checked Gate 1 research outputs. The responses are in `lore-research/validation-archives/2025-01-23-output-evaluation/responses/`. Please read all 8 files and fill out the three analysis documents in the `analysis/` folder:

1. CITATION_VERIFICATION_MATRIX.md - Track which citations were verified
2. CONSENSUS_SUMMARY.md - Overall ratings and consensus
3. CORRECTIONS_NEEDED.md - What needs to be fixed

The goal is to determine if Gate 1 outputs are production-ready or need corrections."

# Comprehensive Template Evaluation

## Executive Summary

**Overall Rating: 3.5/5** - Admirably rigorous for esoteric synthesis, but several critical gaps need addressing before production.

**Verdict:** These templates show exceptional citation discipline for the genre, but they're **optimistically ambitious** about what's achievable. The biggest risk isn't methodology‚Äîit's **AI hallucination of citations that look real but aren't**.

---

## 1. Citation Requirements

**Rating: 4/5** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### Strengths
- Requiring page numbers + quotes + editions is **unusually rigorous** for esoteric work
- The "REJECTED if metadata missing" policy shows strong quality commitment
- URL requirements aid verification

### Weaknesses
- **AI Citation Hallucination Risk:** LLMs are notorious for generating plausible-looking citations that don't exist. Your templates don't guard against this.
- **Achievability Issues:**
  - Many channeled sources lack page numbers (e.g., oral transmissions, unpublished manuscripts)
  - Indigenous sources may be oral tradition only
  - Some Gene Keys editions don't have page numbers (website format)
  - Ra Uru Hu's work includes recordings/lectures without transcripts

### Recommendations

**Add to EVERY template:**

```json
"citation_verification": {
  "verifier_name": "REQUIRED: Your name/initials",
  "verification_method": "direct_access|secondary_source|inferred_from_index",
  "verification_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "confidence": "verified|probable|uncertain",
  "notes": "How you verified this citation exists"
}
```

**Add this check:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è ANTI-HALLUCINATION CHECK:
- If you cannot personally verify this citation exists, mark confidence as "uncertain"
- If citing from memory/training data without direct access, mark as "probable"
- Only mark "verified" if you accessed the actual source during this session
```

**Modify "unknown" policy:**
Instead of treating "unknown" as failure, create tiers:
- `verified` - Direct access to source
- `cited_secondary` - Found in bibliographies/citations from other scholars
- `oral_tradition` - No written source available
- `unavailable` - Source exists but not accessible
- `disputed` - Source existence is contested

---

## 2. Research Scope

### Pass A (Baseline Sources) **Rating: 5/5** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Excellent.** Ra Uru Hu + Gene Keys + I Ching is the definitional triad for Human Design. No changes needed.

‚ö†Ô∏è **But add:**
```json
"source_availability": {
  "ra_uru_hu_accessible": true|false,
  "gene_keys_accessible": true|false,
  "i_ching_accessible": true|false,
  "if_false_explain": "Why source was unavailable"
}
```

### Pass B (Ancient Wisdom) **Rating: 3/5** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Problems:**

1. **Uneven Distribution:** Chinese tradition has 5,000 years of texts; Dogon has oral cosmology. Expecting equal citation rigor is unrealistic.

2. **Cultural Appropriation Risk:** Indigenous knowledge (especially Hopi, Dogon, Aboriginal) often has usage restrictions. Extracting quotes without permission/context is ethically fraught.

3. **Translation Cascade:** Ancient texts ‚Üí English translations ‚Üí archetypal interpretation = 3+ layers of interpretation. Your templates don't track this.

**CRITICAL ADDITION NEEDED:**

```json
"indigenous_sources": [
  {
    "culture": "Hopi|Dogon|Aboriginal|...",
    "permission_status": "public_domain|cited_with_permission|ethically_uncertain",
    "cultural_sensitivity_note": "Brief note on usage context",
    "elder_approved": true|false|unknown
  }
]
```

**Recommended Scope Adjustment:**

| Tradition | Requirement | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Egyptian | Optional (1-2) | Well-documented, accessible |
| Chinese | **Mandatory** (I Ching #{{GATE}}) | Direct parallel structure |
| Vedic | Optional (1-2) | Vast corpus, good translations |
| Indigenous | **Max 1, only if public domain** | Ethical constraints |
| Greek | Optional (1-2) | Well-documented |
| Sumerian | Optional (0-1) | Sparse, disputed translations |

### Pass C (Star Systems) **Rating: 3.5/5** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Good list, but problematic assumptions:**

1. **Source Quality Variance:**
   - Sirius: Mix of ancient Egyptian + modern channeling
   - Zeta Reticuli: Entirely modern (post-1961 Betty/Barney Hill)
   - Draco: Heavily disputed, often associated with negative narratives

2. **The "8 Star Systems" aren't equally ancient:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Star System Sources] --> B[Ancient References]
    A --> C[Modern Channeling]
    A --> D[UFO Contact Reports]
    
    B --> E[Sirius - Egyptian]
    B --> F[Pleiades - Aboriginal/Greek]
    B --> G[Orion - Egyptian/Sumerian]
    
    C --> H[Arcturus - Post-1970s]
    C --> I[Andromeda - Post-1980s]
    
    D --> J[Zeta Reticuli - 1961+]
    D --> K[Draco - 1990s+]
```

**CRITICAL: You're treating fundamentally different source types as equivalent.**

**REQUIRED ADDITION:**

```json
"star_system_metadata": {
  "ancient_attestation": true|false,
  "earliest_reference_date": "YYYY or 'ancient'",
  "source_base": "ancient_texts|modern_channeling|contact_reports|mixed",
  "controversy_level": "consensus|minor_dispute|highly_contested",
  "primary_culture": "Egyptian|Indigenous|Modern_Western|etc."
}
```

**Recommendation:** Separate star systems into tiers:

**Tier 1 (Ancient Attestation):**
- Sirius ‚úÖ
- Pleiades ‚úÖ
- Orion ‚úÖ

**Tier 2 (Mixed Ancient/Modern):**
- Lyra (Greek Orphic + modern)
- Arcturus (obscure ancient + modern channeling)

**Tier 3 (Primarily Modern):**
- Andromeda
- Draco
- Zeta Reticuli

Then require **at least 1 Tier 1 alignment** before suggesting Tier 3.

## 3. Quality Checks

**Rating: 2.5/5** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### Current Checks (All citation-focused):
‚úÖ Page numbers present  
‚úÖ Quotes present  
‚úÖ Edition info present  
‚úÖ URLs present  

### MISSING CRITICAL CHECKS:

```json
"quality_validation": {
  "internal_consistency": {
    "check": "Do all three passes align on gate essence?",
    "pass": true|false,
    "explanation": "..."
  },
  "cross_validation": {
    "check": "Do ‚â•2 independent sources support this alignment?",
    "pass": true|false,
    "explanation": "..."
  },
  "contradiction_assessment": {
    "check": "Are there sources that contradict this alignment?",
    "contradictions_found": 0-5,
    "how_addressed": "..."
  },
  "interpretation_layering": {
    "check": "How many layers of interpretation exist?",
    "layers": ["original_text", "translation", "archetypal_mapping", "star_system_synthesis"],
    "risk_assessment": "low|medium|high"
  },
  "confirmation_bias_check": {
    "check": "Were sources actively sought that DISPROVE this alignment?",
    "disconfirming_sources_reviewed": 0-5,
    "result": "alignment_holds|alignment_weakened|alignment_rejected"
  }
}
```

**Add this to Pass C:**

```
MANDATORY DISCONFIRMATION STEP:
Before finalizing, you MUST:
1. Search for sources that contradict this alignment
2. List at least 2 alternative interpretations
3. Explain why you chose this alignment despite alternatives
4. Rate strength: weak|moderate|strong evidence
```

---

## 4. Evidence Types

**Rating: 3/5** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Current: `explicit | thematic | cross_cultural | inferred`

### Problems:

1. **"Explicit"** is misleading‚Äîno ancient text explicitly mentions "Gate 17 maps to Arcturus"
2. **No gradation of "inferred"**‚Äîthere's a huge difference between "1 inference step" and "4 inference steps"
3. **No tracking of interpreter bias**

### Improved Taxonomy:

```json
"evidence_classification": {
  "evidence_type": "direct_parallel|symbolic_resonance|etymological|numerical|cross_cultural_pattern|speculative_synthesis",
  "inference_layers": 1-5,
  "interpreter_confidence": 1-10,
  "supporting_sources": 0-10,
  "contradicting_sources": 0-10,
  "cultural_specificity": "culture_specific|cross_cultural|universal_archetype"
}
```

**Definitions:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `direct_parallel` | Ancient text explicitly describes similar archetype | I Ching Hexagram 17 = "Following" matches Gate 17 |
| `symbolic_resonance` | Symbols/imagery align across traditions | Sirius + water imagery in Egyptian/Dogon |
| `etymological` | Linguistic connections | Gate name roots match star mythology |
| `numerical` | Number symbolism aligns | Gate 22 + 22 Tarot Paths |
| `cross_cultural_pattern` | ‚â•3 traditions show same archetype | Great Mother across cultures |
| `speculative_synthesis` | Modern interpretation with thin sourcing | "Arcturian healing energy" |

**Inference Layer Examples:**

- **Layer 1:** Gate 17 = "Following" ‚Üí I Ching Hex 17 = "Following" ‚úÖ
- **Layer 2:** Gate 17 = Ajna authority ‚Üí Sirius = wisdom ‚Üí Connection
- **Layer 3:** Gate 17 ‚Üí leadership archetype ‚Üí Orion = hierarchy ‚Üí Alignment
- **Layer 4:** Gate 17 ‚Üí spleen center ‚Üí fear ‚Üí Zeta curiosity ‚Üí ...? üö©
- **Layer 5+:** You're in fanfiction territory üõë

**Add to Pass C:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è INFERENCE LAYER LIMIT: 
- Layers 1-2: Acceptable
- Layer 3: Requires strong cross-validation
- Layer 4+: Mark as "speculative" and require disclaimer
```

---

## 5. Confidence Levels

**Rating: 3.5/5** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Current: `high | medium | low | speculative`

### This works, but needs definitions:

```json
"confidence_definitions": {
  "high": "‚â•3 independent sources, ‚â§2 inference layers, cross-cultural pattern, no major contradictions",
  "medium": "2 sources, ‚â§3 inference layers, thematic alignment, minor contradictions addressed",
  "low": "1 source, 3-4 inference layers, symbolic resonance only, contradictions exist",
  "speculative": "0-1 sources, ‚â•4 inference layers, modern synthesis, significant contradictions"
}
```

**Better: Add numerical score alongside label:**

```json
"confidence": {
  "label": "medium",
  "score": 6.5,
  "scale": "0-10 (0=pure speculation, 10=multiple ancient sources explicitly agree)",
  "breakdown": {
    "source_count": 2,
    "inference_layers": 3,
    "cross_cultural": true,
    "contradictions": 1,
    "ancient_attestation": false
  }
}
```

---

## 6. Source Mix (Ancient vs. Modern)

**Rating: 2/5** ‚≠ê‚≠ê

### Major Problem: Your templates treat these as equivalent:

**Not Equivalent:**

| Source Type | Characteristics | Reliability |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Ancient Texts** | Millennium+ old, multiple translations, scholarly consensus | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Mystery Schools** | Oral ‚Üí written, centuries old, fragmented | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Channeled (pre-1950)** | Blavatsky, Bailey, Cayce - historically influential | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Channeled (modern)** | Post-1970s, no external validation, highly variable | ‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Contact Reports** | Subjective, no independent verification | ‚≠ê |

### CRITICAL MISSING REQUIREMENT:

```json
"source_distribution_requirements": {
  "minimum_ancient": 1,
  "minimum_scholarly_secondary": 1,
  "maximum_channeled_only": 0,
  "required_mix": "Each alignment needs at least 1 ancient OR scholarly source + may include channeled as supporting"
}
```

**Unacceptable:**
```json
// üö´ All sources are channeled
"sources": [
  { "title": "The Arcturian Council", "source_type": "channeled" },
  { "title": "Pleiadian Teachings", "source_type": "channeled" },
  { "title": "Sirian Messages", "source_type": "channeled" }
]
```

**Acceptable:**
```json
// ‚úÖ Grounded in ancient text + modern interpretation
"sources": [
  { "title": "Pyramid Texts", "source_type": "ancient" },
  { "title": "The Sirius Mystery", "source_type": "research" },
  { "title": "Sirian Revelations", "source_type": "channeled" }
]
```

### Recommendation:

**Source Type Hierarchy:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Evidence Strength] --> B[Tier 1: Required]
    A --> C[Tier 2: Preferred]
    A --> D[Tier 3: Supporting Only]
    
    B --> E[Ancient texts 3000+ years]
    B --> F[Scholarly research]
    
    C --> G[Historical mystery schools]
    C --> H[Indigenous oral tradition]
    
    D --> I[Modern channeling]
    D --> J[Contact reports]
```

**Rule:** Each Pass C alignment needs:
- **‚â•1 Tier 1** (ancient or scholarly)
- **‚â•1 Tier 2** (historical or indigenous)
- **‚â§2 Tier 3** (channeled/contact)

If **Tier 3 only**, mark as `speculative` and add disclaimer.

---

## 7. Logical Gaps

### Gap 1: **No Null Hypothesis Testing**

You never ask: "What if this gate DOESN'T map to any star system?"

**Add:**
```json
"null_hypothesis": {
  "question": "Could this gate be purely terrestrial archetype?",
  "terrestrial_explanations": ["...", "..."],
  "why_star_system_needed": "Explain what star connection adds"
}
```

### Gap 2: **No Conflicting Source Resolution**

What happens when:
- Ra Uru Hu says Gate 17 is about "opinions"
- Gene Keys says it's about "far-sightedness"
- I Ching says it's about "following"
- You want to map it to Sirius "wisdom"

**Current templates:** Ignore conflicts, cherry-pick convenient meanings.

**Add:**
```json
"source_conflicts": [
  {
    "conflict_type": "definitional|interpretive|factual",
    "sources_in_conflict": ["Ra Uru Hu", "Gene Keys"],
    "conflict_description": "...",
    "resolution_method": "synthesis|preference|acknowledged_ambiguity",
    "resolution_rationale": "..."
  }
]
```

### Gap 3: **No Cultural Context Tracking**

Example: Sirius is Egyptian sacred star... but you're applying it to a system (Human Design) created by a Canadian in the 1980s, based on Hindu chakras + I Ching + Kabbalah.

**Add:**
```json
"cultural_synthesis": {
  "source_culture": "Egyptian",
  "target_system_culture": "Modern_Western_Esoteric",
  "cultural_distance": "minimal|moderate|significant|problematic",
  "synthesis_justification": "Why this cross-cultural mapping is valid",
  "potential_distortions": "What might be lost/changed in translation"
}
```

### Gap 4: **No Temporal Tracking**

You're mixing:
- I Ching (1000 BCE)
- Egyptian Pyramid Texts (2400 BCE)
- Ra Uru Hu (1987 CE)
- Modern Pleiadian channeling (2015 CE)

That's a **4,500-year span**. Cultural context changes radically.

**Add:**
```json
"temporal_spread": {
  "earliest_source": -2400,
  "latest_source": 2015,
  "span_years": 4415,
  "temporal_consistency": "Can these sources meaningfully speak to each other?"
}
```

### Gap 5: **No Validation Loop**

After creating all 64 gates:
- Do the star system distributions make sense?
- Are some stars over-represented?
- Are gates with similar meanings getting different stars?

**Add Post-Processing Template:**

```json
"cross_gate_validation": {
  "similar_gates": [17, 18, 48],
  "do_star_mappings_cluster": true|false,
  "if_false_explain": "Why similar gates map to different stars",
  "overall_pattern_check": "Does the full 64-gate map show coherent archetypes?"
}
```

## 8. Practical Concerns

**Rating: 2.5/5** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### Can AI Execute These? **Partially.**

**What Will Work:**
- ‚úÖ JSON structure generation
- ‚úÖ Finding sources (titles, authors)
- ‚úÖ Generating plausible synthesis text
- ‚úÖ Following format rules

**What Will Fail:**
- ‚ùå **Citation verification** (AIs hallucinate page numbers constantly)
- ‚ùå **Quote extraction** (will generate plausible-sounding fake quotes)
- ‚ùå **Edition tracking** (will guess editions)
- ‚ùå **URL validation** (will create non-existent URLs)
- ‚ùå **Nuanced source evaluation** (can't judge source quality)
- ‚ùå **Contradiction detection** (will smooth over conflicts)

### Failure Modes

**Top 5 Ways This Fails:**

1. **Citation Hallucination Cascade**
   ```json
   // AI generates this - looks real, ISN'T:
   "quote": "The followers of Sirius embody divine wisdom",
   "page": "pp. 127-128",
   "edition": "3rd Edition 1998"
   // Reality: Book only has 2 editions, neither has this quote
   ```

2. **Confirmation Bias Lock-In**
   - AI knows you want star system connections
   - Will find them even if they don't exist
   - Will ignore contradicting sources

3. **Quality Check Theater**
   - AI will mark all quality checks as ‚úÖ
   - Even when they're not actually met
   - Because it's optimizing for approval, not truth

4. **Source Mixing Inappropriate**
   - Will treat channeled blog post = ancient Egyptian text
   - Will cite "The Arcturian Council YouTube video" next to the Rig Veda
   - No real source quality discrimination

5. **"Unknown" Avoidance Over-Correction**
   - Your templates punish "unknown"
   - AI will fabricate rather than admit uncertainty
   - **Better to have honest "unavailable" than fake citations**

### Solution: **Human-in-the-Loop Verification**

**Recommended Workflow:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AI generates initial JSON] --> B{Human spot-checks citations}
    B -->|3+ citations verified| C[Accept]
    B -->|1-2 verified| D[Request revision with verified examples]
    B -->|0 verified| E[Reject, mark sources as uncertain]
    
    C --> F[AI generates Pass B]
    F --> B
    
    E --> G[Move forward with 'unverified' flag]
    G --> H[Display warning to users]
```

**Add to each template:**

```json
"human_verification": {
  "verifier_initials": "REQUIRED",
  "citations_spot_checked": 3,
  "citations_verified": 2,
  "citations_hallucinated": 1,
  "verification_date": "2025-10-23",
  "confidence_in_ai_output": "high|medium|low",
  "notes": "Which citations were actually verified"
}
```

---

## 9. Defensibility

**Rating: 3/5** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

### Weakest Points (What Skeptics Will Attack)

**1. The Fundamental Premise**

> "Why should Human Design gates (created 1987) map to ancient star systems?"

**Your Answer Needs To Be:**
- ‚úÖ "We're exploring archetypal resonances across systems"
- ‚úÖ "This is interpretive synthesis, not claiming literal alien origins"
- ‚úÖ "Framework is transparent about methodology and sources"

**Not:**
- ‚ùå "Because the gates actually came from these stars"
- ‚ùå "Ra Uru Hu channeled this information"
- ‚ùå "Ancient civilizations knew about Human Design"

**2. Source Quality**

Skeptic: "You're citing YouTube channelers next to the Pyramid Texts. That's not research."

**Defense:** Implement source tiering (see Section 6). Show ancient sources anchor the work, modern sources extend it.

**3. Cherry-Picking**

Skeptic: "You only include sources that support your thesis."

**Defense:** Add contradiction tracking (see Gap 2). Show you considered conflicting interpretations.

**4. Cultural Appropriation**

Skeptic: "You're extracting Indigenous knowledge without permission."

**Defense:** 
- Only use publicly-published Indigenous sources
- Cite specific permissions when available
- Add cultural sensitivity notes
- Consider removing Indigenous sources if usage rights uncertain

**5. Fabricated Citations**

Skeptic: "I checked your citations. Page 127 doesn't say that."

**Defense:** 
- Human verification of all citations
- Mark confidence levels
- Provide direct links when possible
- Honest "citation unavailable" better than fake citation

### Legal/Ethical Red Lines

**Safe:**
- ‚úÖ "For entertainment and insight"
- ‚úÖ "Archetypal exploration"
- ‚úÖ "Personal reflection tool"
- ‚úÖ Citing sources clearly

**Dangerous:**
- üö´ "This reveals your alien soul origin"
- üö´ "Make life decisions based on this"
- üö´ "Scientifically proven"
- üö´ Claiming medical/therapeutic benefits

### Recommended Disclaimer

```
METHODOLOGY TRANSPARENCY

This synthesis maps Human Design gates to star system archetypes by:
1. Grounding in established sources (Ra Uru Hu, Gene Keys, I Ching)
2. Cross-referencing ancient wisdom traditions
3. Exploring thematic resonances with star system mythologies

SOURCE TYPES:
‚Ä¢ Ancient texts (Egyptian, Chinese, Vedic) - archetypal foundations
‚Ä¢ Historical mystery schools - interpretive frameworks  
‚Ä¢ Modern esoteric sources - contemporary synthesis
‚Ä¢ Channeled material - marked as such, supporting only

LIMITATIONS:
‚Ä¢ This is interpretive synthesis, not scientific research
‚Ä¢ Multiple valid interpretations exist for each gate
‚Ä¢ Star system connections are archetypal, not literal
‚Ä¢ Some sources cannot be independently verified
‚Ä¢ Inference layers increase with each synthesis step

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
‚Ä¢ High: Multiple ancient sources, cross-cultural patterns
‚Ä¢ Medium: Mixed ancient/modern, thematic alignment
‚Ä¢ Low: Primarily modern sources, symbolic resonance
‚Ä¢ Speculative: Thin sourcing, extended inference

This tool is for insight and entertainment. Verify citations independently. 
Do not make medical, financial, or major life decisions based on these archetypes.
```

## 10. Overall Assessment

### Are These Templates Ready for Production?

**No‚Äîbut they're 80% there.**

### What's the Biggest Risk?

üö® **AI citation hallucination** (by far)

Your templates are more rigorous than most esoteric work, but they assume AI can:
1. Access actual sources
2. Extract real quotes
3. Provide accurate page numbers
4. Distinguish source quality

**Current AI (including Claude) cannot reliably do this.** We work from training data, not live source access. We will generate citations that *look* real but aren't.

### What Would I Change Before Launching?

**Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Must Have)**

1. **Add Citation Verification System**
   - Human spot-checks mandatory
   - Mark AI-generated vs. human-verified
   - Display confidence levels to users

2. **Add Source Type Hierarchy**
   - Tier ancient sources above channeled
   - Require at least 1 Tier 1 source per alignment
   - Flag "channeled-only" alignments

3. **Add Contradiction Tracking**
   - Force AI to search for disconfirming evidence
   - Show conflicting interpretations
   - Explain why one interpretation chosen

4. **Add Cultural Sensitivity Layer**
   - Flag Indigenous sources
   - Require permission/public domain check
   - Add context notes

5. **Soften "Unknown = Failure" Policy**
   - Create `citation_confidence` spectrum
   - Allow honest "unavailable" with explanation
   - Better to admit uncertainty than fabricate

**Priority 2: Nice to Have**

6. Add inference layer tracking
7. Add null hypothesis testing
8. Add temporal spread calculation
9. Add cross-gate validation
10. Add numerical confidence scoring

### Revised Quality Check

**Replace your current checks with:**

```
QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:

TIER 1 (MANDATORY):
- ‚úÖ JSON structure valid?
- ‚úÖ All required fields present?
- ‚úÖ At least 1 citation per required category?
- ‚úÖ Confidence levels assigned?

TIER 2 (CITATION QUALITY):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Are page numbers specific (not "various" or "multiple")?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Are quotes ‚â§25 words and directly relevant?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Are editions/translations specified?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If NO to any: Mark confidence as "uncertain" and explain

TIER 3 (SOURCE QUALITY):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Is there at least 1 ancient or scholarly source?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Are channeled sources marked as such?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Are Indigenous sources public domain?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If NO to any: Add notes explaining source limitations

TIER 4 (LOGICAL CONSISTENCY):
- üîç Do conflicting interpretations exist? (List them)
- üîç Are there sources that contradict this alignment? (List them)
- üîç How many inference layers exist? (Count them)
- üîç Does this alignment make sense in context of other gates?

ANTI-HALLUCINATION CHECK:
- üõë Have you personally verified these citations exist?
- üõë If NO, mark confidence as "AI-generated, unverified"
- üõë Recommend human verification before publication

If ANY Tier 1 check fails ‚Üí REJECT
If ‚â•2 Tier 2 checks fail ‚Üí Mark confidence as LOW
If ‚â•2 Tier 3 checks fail ‚Üí Mark as SPECULATIVE
Tier 4 ‚Üí Required for all, informs confidence level
```

### Strongest Elements
1. ‚≠ê Citation rigor (for the genre)
2. ‚≠ê JSON structure (machine-readable)
3. ‚≠ê Three-pass methodology (good separation of concerns)
4. ‚≠ê Transparency goals (ethical framing)

### Weakest Elements
1. üî¥ Over-reliance on AI citation accuracy
2. üî¥ No source quality hierarchy
3. üî¥ No contradiction handling
4. üî¥ Inference layer tracking missing

### Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Add human verification layer
- [ ] Implement source tiering system
- [ ] Add contradiction tracking
- [ ] Revise quality checks (4-tier system)
- [ ] Add cultural sensitivity protocols
- [ ] Soften "unknown = failure" policy
- [ ] Add inference layer counter

### Estimated Work

- **Critical fixes:** 20-30 hours
- **Nice-to-haves:** 15-20 hours
- **Testing/validation:** 40-60 hours (for 64 gates)
- **Total:** 75-110 hours

### Timeline

If you fix the critical issues, you could soft-launch in **2-3 weeks** with:
- 10 gates fully validated (showcase quality)
- 54 gates marked "preliminary" (AI-generated, human verification pending)
- Clear disclaimer about verification status
- Community feedback loop for citation checking

| Category | Rating | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Citation Requirements | 4/5 | Fix hallucination risk |
| Research Scope | 4/5 | Good overall |
| Quality Checks | 2.5/5 | **Needs major revision** |

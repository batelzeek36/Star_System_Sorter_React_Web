# Research Template Evaluation

## Executive Summary
The templates demonstrate exceptional rigor for esoteric synthesis work—perhaps *too* rigorous for practical execution. While the citation standards are academically admirable, they may create execution bottlenecks that compromise the project's viability. The methodology is intellectually defensible but needs pragmatic adjustments.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Citation Requirements (Rating: 3.5/5)
**Strengths:**
- Page numbers + quotes + editions create verifiable trail
- Transparency builds credibility for esoteric work
- Quality checks prevent citation dumping

**Concerns:**
- **Over-specified for esoteric sources**: Many channeled/oral tradition texts lack standard pagination
- **AI limitations**: Current LLMs struggle with exact page numbers for books not in training data
- **Quote requirement problematic**: 25-word limit may distort meaning in esoteric texts

**Recommendations:**
```
Replace rigid requirements with tiered system:
- Tier 1: Full citation (page, quote, edition) - when available
- Tier 2: Chapter/section reference - for digital/oral sources  
- Tier 3: Work reference only - for contested/channeled material
Mark citation quality level (1-3) for transparency
```

| Pass | Scope Assessment | Rating |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| **A** | Ra Uru Hu + Gene Keys + I Ching | Sufficient baseline ✓ |
| **B** | 6 ancient traditions | Good coverage, consider adding Kabbalistic texts |
| **C** | 8 star systems | Comprehensive, maybe add Vega for completion |

**Missing:** Aboriginal Dreamtime connections could strengthen Pass B

# Template Evaluation - Beam Validation Run

**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Prompt Used:** `TEMPLATE_EVALUATION_BEAM.md`  
**Purpose:** Evaluate the three-pass research template methodology (Pass A, B, C)  
**Models:** 8 models recommended by GPT-5 for template audit

## Models Used

1. **GPT-5 Pro (2025-10-06)** - Top reasoning + schema discipline
2. **GPT-5 ChatGPT (Non-Thinking)** - RLHF-tuned judgments; sanity check
3. **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking)** - Strongest Anthropic reasoner; edge-case policy
4. **Claude Opus 4.1 (Thinking)** - Different Anthropic flavor; catches ambiguity
5. **Grok 4 Fast Reasoning** - Concise, decisive; "is this feasible?" calls
6. **Grok 4 Fast (0709 if needed)** - Second xAI angle to expose disagreement
7. **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Conservative with formatting; JSON-strictness check
8. **Perplexity Sonar Reasoning Pro** - Search disabled to avoid web drift

## Evaluation Focus

- Citation requirements (page numbers, quotes, editions)
- Research scope (Pass A: HD sources, Pass B: ancient texts, Pass C: star systems)
- Quality checks and validation
- Evidence types and confidence levels
- Source mix (ancient vs. channeled vs. research)
- Logical gaps and practical concerns
- Defensibility and launch readiness

## Files

- `responses/` - Individual model responses
- `analysis/` - Consensus analysis and action items
- `BEAM_RESPONSE_MATRIX.md` - Ratings matrix (to be filled)

## Next Steps

1. Paste all 8 model responses into their respective files
2. Run consensus analysis
3. Extract critical issues (6+ models agree)
4. Create prioritized action plan
5. Determine if templates need revision before production use

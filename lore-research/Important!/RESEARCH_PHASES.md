# Research Phases: The Correct Order

## Overview

To build a defensible gate-to-star-system classification system, research must happen in the correct order.

---

## Phase 0: Star System Baseline Research (REQUIRED FIRST)

### What

Establish documented characteristics for all 8 star systems with 5+ sources each.

### Why

**You cannot match gates to star systems if you haven't proven what the star systems represent.**

Without this, you're just:

- Guessing what Pleiades means
- Confirming your own biases
- Making unsupported claims

### How

1. Create Comet prompts for each star system
2. Research 5+ sources per characteristic
3. Extract quotes, page numbers, editions, URLs
4. Compile into baseline database
5. Validate consensus patterns

### Deliverables

- `star-systems-baseline.yaml` - Full database
- `star-systems-research-report.md` - Analysis
- 8 star system research prompts

### Time Estimate

~20 hours (2-3 days focused work)

### Success Criteria

✅ All 8 systems have 3-5 documented characteristics  
✅ Each characteristic has 5+ sources with full citations  
✅ Consensus patterns are identified  
✅ Ancient + modern sources are balanced

---

## Phase 1: Gate Research (AFTER Phase 0)

### What

Map 64 Human Design gates to star systems based on thematic alignment.

### Why

Now that we know what each star system represents (Phase 0), we can logically match gate archetypes to them.

### How

**Multi-Pass (Recommended):**

1. Pass A: HD/Gene Keys/I Ching foundation
2. Pass B: Ancient wisdom parallels
3. Pass C: Star system alignments (using Phase 0 baseline)

**Single-Shot (Faster):**

1. One comprehensive prompt per gate

### Deliverables

- 64 gate research files (JSON)
- Compiled lore rules (YAML)
- Full citation database

### Time Estimate

- Multi-pass: ~16 hours (15 min/gate)
- Single-shot: ~7 hours (7 min/gate)

### Success Criteria

✅ All 64 gates researched  
✅ 3-5 star system alignments per gate  
✅ Full citations for all connections  
✅ Confidence levels assigned

---

## Why This Order Matters

### Wrong Order (Confirmation Bias)

```
❌ Research Gate 1
❌ "Hmm, creative... maybe Pleiades?"
❌ Search for "Pleiades creative"
❌ Find one source that mentions it
❌ "Confirmed! Gate 1 = Pleiades"
```

**Problem:** You're finding what you're looking for, not what's actually documented.

### Right Order (Defensible Logic)

```
✅ Research Pleiades characteristics
✅ Find 6 sources: "artistic, nurturing, creative, empathic"
✅ Document with full citations
✅ Research Gate 1 meaning
✅ Ra Uru Hu: "creative self-expression"
✅ Match: Creative expression ↔ Artistic nature
✅ "Gate 1 aligns with Pleiades based on documented characteristics"
```

**Result:** Logical, transparent, defensible.

## The Logic Chain

### Phase 0 Establishes

**"Star System X has characteristics A, B, C"**

- Supported by: [Source 1], [Source 2], [Source 3], [Source 4], [Source 5]
- Consensus: High/Medium/Low
- Ancient validation: Yes/No

### Phase 1 Matches

**"Gate Y has archetype that matches characteristic A"**

- Gate meaning: [Ra Uru Hu citation]
- Star system characteristic: [Phase 0 baseline]
- Thematic match: Logical alignment
- Confidence: High/Medium/Low

### Result

**"Gate Y aligns with Star System X"**

- Based on: Documented gate meaning + Documented star system characteristics
- Evidence: Full citations on both sides
- Transparent: Users can verify all sources

## Current Status

### Phase 0: NOT STARTED ⚠️

- [ ] Create star system baseline prompts (8 prompts)
- [ ] Research Sirius characteristics
- [ ] Research Pleiades characteristics
- [ ] Research Orion characteristics
- [ ] Research Arcturus characteristics
- [ ] Research Andromeda characteristics
- [ ] Research Lyra characteristics
- [ ] Research Draco characteristics
- [ ] Research Zeta Reticuli characteristics
- [ ] Compile baseline database
- [ ] Validate consensus patterns

### Phase 1: BLOCKED (waiting for Phase 0)

- [ ] Gate 1 research
- [ ] Gates 2-64 research
- [ ] Compile lore rules
- [ ] Validate with scorer

## Next Actions

1. **Read:** `STAR_SYSTEM_BASELINE_RESEARCH.md`
2. **Create:** 8 star system baseline prompts
3. **Research:** Run all 8 prompts through Comet
4. **Compile:** Build baseline database
5. **Validate:** Check consensus and source quality
6. **THEN:** Begin gate research (Phase 1)

---

## Timeline

**Phase 0:** 2-3 days focused work  
**Phase 1:** 1-2 days focused work  
**Total:** 3-5 days for complete research

**This is the foundation. Don't skip it.**

---

**Status:** Phase 0 required before proceeding  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Blocker:** Cannot do gate research without star system baseline

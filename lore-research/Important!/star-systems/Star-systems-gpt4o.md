Here’s a cross-checkable **Phase 0 intelligence drop** for your **Star System Sorter (S³)**. This serves as a **working hypothesis** to validate via Comet, your lore team, or external literature. It distills what’s currently known (and commonly repeated) about each of the 8 star systems from a mix of **esoteric texts, channeled sources, mythological references, and UFO lore**.

# 🛠 Next Steps

You can now generate **8 Comet prompts** using this data as hypothesis validation.

Here’s a universal **Comet prompt template** for any system:

```txt
Research [STAR SYSTEM] in esoteric, ancient, and modern sources.

Requirements:
- 5+ distinct sources for each trait
- Page numbers, direct quotes (<25 words)
- Ancient + modern + channeled sources
- Focus on consensus archetypes (3–5)

Return JSON in this format:

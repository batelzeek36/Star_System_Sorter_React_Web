# Lore Generation Strategy
## The Challenge We're Facing

### Current State
- **Lore rules implemented:** ~50 rules
- **Lore rules needed:** ~500 rules (10x more)
- **Coverage gaps:**
  - Only 15 of 64 gates have rules (missing 49 gates)
  - Only 10 of 36 channels mapped (missing 26 channels)
  - Basic profile/center coverage (needs depth)

### Why This Matters
The Star System Sorter's classification quality depends entirely on lore rule completeness. With only 50 rules:
- Classifications are **shallow** (missing most gate/channel data)
- Results are **unbalanced** (some systems over-represented)
- Provenance is **incomplete** (users can't see full reasoning)

### The Scale of Work
To properly classify users, we need rules for:
- **64 gates** × 8 systems × ~1.5 rules per gate = ~768 gate rules
- **36 channels** × 8 systems × ~1 rule per channel = ~288 channel rules  
- **12 profiles** × 8 systems = ~96 profile rules
- **9 centers** × 8 systems = ~72 center rules
- **Synergy rules** (multi-attribute combinations) = ~100+ rules

**Total needed:** 500-1000 rules for comprehensive coverage

## Recommended Approaches

### Approach 1: AI-Assisted Batch Generation (FASTEST) ⭐
**Timeline:** 2-3 days  
**Quality:** Medium-High (with review)  
**Effort:** Low (mostly AI-driven)

#### How It Works
1. **Claude (me) generates rules in batches** using existing reference materials
2. **You validate with compiler** (`npm run compile:lore`)
3. **Quick review** for obvious errors
4. **Iterate** until all rules are generated

#### Workflow
```
Session 1: Gates 1-20    → 20 rules → Validate → Commit
Session 2: Gates 21-40   → 20 rules → Validate → Commit
Session 3: Gates 41-64   → 24 rules → Validate → Commit
Session 4: Channels 1-18 → 18 rules → Validate → Commit
Session 5: Channels 19-36 → 18 rules → Validate → Commit
Session 6: Profiles/Centers → 50 rules → Validate → Commit
Session 7: Synergies → 50 rules → Validate → Commit
```

**Total:** 200 rules in 7 sessions (can do 2-3 sessions per day)

#### Pros
- ✅ Fastest approach
- ✅ Consistent formatting (AI follows schema perfectly)
- ✅ Immediate validation (compiler catches errors)
- ✅ Iterative refinement (fix issues as we go)

#### Cons
- ⚠️ Requires review (AI might misinterpret esoteric concepts)
- ⚠️ Medium confidence initially (can increase with testing)

#### Tools Needed
- Claude (me) - rule generation
- Your lore compiler - validation
- Your classify script - testing

---

### Approach 2: Hybrid Research + AI Generation (BALANCED)
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Quality:** High  
**Effort:** Medium

#### How It Works
1. **You or Perplexity research** gate meanings + sources (2-3 min per gate)
2. **Claude (me) formats** research into YAML rules (instant)
3. **Compiler validates** structure
4. **You test** against known charts

#### Workflow
```
Research Phase (You/Perplexity):
- Gates 1-10: Find meanings, lore, sources → Notes
- Gates 11-20: Find meanings, lore, sources → Notes
- ... continue for all 64 gates

Generation Phase (Claude):
- Convert all notes → YAML rules → Validate → Commit

Testing Phase (You):
- Test against your HD chart
- Test against friend charts
- Adjust weights if needed
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Higher quality (human-verified research)
- ✅ Better source citations (real URLs, book pages)
- ✅ More confidence in accuracy

#### Cons
- ⚠️ Slower (research takes time)
- ⚠️ More manual effort (you do research)

#### Tools Needed
- Perplexity Pro - research with citations
- Claude (me) - YAML formatting
- Your lore compiler - validation
- Your classify script - testing

---

### Approach 3: Automated Baseline + Manual Refinement (PRAGMATIC)
**Timeline:** 1 week  
**Quality:** Medium → High (over time)  
**Effort:** Low upfront, ongoing refinement

#### How It Works
1. **Create automation script** that reads `gates.md` and generates baseline rules
2. **Claude (me) generates** 200-300 rules automatically from existing docs
3. **You review** and flag low-confidence rules
4. **Iteratively refine** rules based on user feedback and testing

#### Workflow
```
Phase 1: Automated Generation (1 day)
- Script reads gates.md
- Extracts gate meanings + star system candidates
- Generates baseline YAML rules
- Output: 200+ rules (low-medium confidence)

Phase 2: Validation (1 day)
- Run compiler
- Fix validation errors
- Test against known charts
- Flag suspicious rules

Phase 3: Refinement (ongoing)
- Users test classifications
- Collect feedback on accuracy
- Adjust weights and rationale
- Increment confidence levels
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Fast initial coverage (200+ rules in 1 day)
- ✅ Gets app functional quickly
- ✅ Can refine over time with real data

#### Cons
- ⚠️ Lower initial quality (automated extraction)
- ⚠️ Requires ongoing maintenance
- ⚠️ May need significant adjustments

#### Tools Needed
- Node.js script - automated rule generation
- Claude (me) - script creation + refinement
- Your lore compiler - validation
- User feedback - quality improvement

### Approach 4: Manual Expert Research (HIGHEST QUALITY)
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks  
**Quality:** Highest  
**Effort:** Very High

#### How It Works
1. **You deeply research** each gate/channel from primary sources
2. **You write rules** with detailed rationale and citations
3. **Claude (me) assists** with formatting and validation
4. **Extensive testing** against multiple charts

#### Workflow
```
Week 1-2: Gate Research
- Read Ra Uru Hu's Rave I'Ching
- Read Gene Keys book
- Cross-reference esoteric sources
- Write detailed notes per gate

Week 3-4: Rule Writing
- Convert notes to YAML rules
- Add detailed rationale
- Include page numbers, URLs
- High confidence levels (4-5)

Week 5: Channel Research
- Research all 36 channels
- Write synergy rules

Week 6: Testing & Refinement
- Test against 10+ charts
- Adjust weights
- Validate accuracy
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Highest quality and accuracy
- ✅ Best source citations
- ✅ Most defensible classifications
- ✅ Highest confidence levels

#### Cons
- ⚠️ Very slow (weeks of work)
- ⚠️ Requires deep HD knowledge
- ⚠️ Requires access to source materials

#### Tools Needed

## My Recommendation: Approach 1 (AI-Assisted Batch Generation)

### Why This Is Best
1. **Speed:** 200+ rules in 2-3 days vs. weeks
2. **Quality:** Good enough for MVP, can refine later
3. **Validation:** Compiler catches structural errors immediately
4. **Iteration:** Easy to adjust weights based on testing
5. **Existing Resources:** Your `gates.md` already has 80% of needed info

### How We'd Execute

#### Session 1 (Today): Gates 1-20
**Time:** 30 minutes
1. I generate 20 gate rules from `gates.md`
2. You run `npm run compile:lore`
3. Fix any validation errors
4. Test with `npm run classify -- --date 1992-10-03 --time 00:03 --tz America/New_York`
5. Commit to git

**Output:** 20 validated rules

#### Session 2 (Tomorrow): Gates 21-40
**Time:** 30 minutes
- Same process
- **Output:** 20 more rules

#### Session 3: Gates 41-64
**Time:** 30 minutes
- Complete all gates
- **Output:** 24 rules

#### Session 4-5: Channels
**Time:** 1 hour total
- 36 channel rules
- **Output:** 36 rules

#### Session 6-7: Profiles, Centers, Synergies
**Time:** 1 hour total
- Refinement rules
- **Output:** 50+ rules

**Total Time:** ~4 hours of work spread over 2-3 days  
**Total Output:** 150-200 rules

### Quality Assurance

After each batch:
1. **Compiler validation** (catches schema errors)
2. **Test against your chart** (catches logic errors)
3. **Visual inspection** (catches obvious mistakes)
4. **Confidence levels** (start at 2-3, increase with testing)

### Future Refinement

Once we have 200+ rules:
1. **Collect user feedback** ("Does this classification feel accurate?")
2. **A/B test weights** (adjust based on data)
3. **Add sources** (research specific citations)
4. **Increase confidence** (as rules are validated)

## Alternative: Hybrid Approach (1 + 2)

If you want higher quality but still fast:

### Week 1: AI Batch Generation (Approach 1)
- Generate 200 baseline rules
- Get app functional
- Start collecting feedback

### Week 2: Research Enhancement (Approach 2)
- Use Perplexity to research top 20 most-used gates
- Add detailed sources and rationale
- Increase confidence levels
- Refine weights based on testing

**Result:** Fast initial coverage + high-quality refinement where it matters most

High-consensus traits (water/fertility, royal-resurrection) are anchored in ancient texts with clear locks. Initiatory/teacher traits are sustained in modern esoteric and channeled material. The Nommo / Sirius B narrative that portrays Sirian beings as genetic engineers and civilizers of humanity is recent, attached to Sirius B (the invisible white dwarf), and is actively disputed by on-site anthropology, which finds no stable Dogon knowledge of an invisible companion star.

Milanovich (1990) and Kenyon (1996) establish healing/frequency work and guardian themes. Ancient support is minimal and strictly astronomical, unlike Pleiades/Sirius/Orion which have richer ancient mythic associations. The Hebrew word in Job 38:32 ('Ayish) refers to Ursa Major constellation, not specifically Arcturus star; KJV translation as 'Arcturus' is imprecise. Richmond Lattimore and Robert Fagles provide authoritative Homer translations but Odyssey references to Arcturus are brief navigation mentions only.

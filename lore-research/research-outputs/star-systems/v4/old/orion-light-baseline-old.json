  "light_vs_dark_distinctions": "The Light vs Dark Orion distinction is a modern esoteric framework not present in ancient Egyptian sources. Ancient Egyptian texts present Orion-Osiris exclusively as a benevolent resurrection deity, celestial herald of renewal, and guide to the afterlife. The antagonist role is assigned to Set (associated with chaos and disorder), not to Orion itself. Hermetic and mystery school traditions (300 BCE-300 CE) emphasize the Thoth-Hermes lineage as wisdom keepers, teachers, and preservers of sacred knowledge - consistently positive roles. The explicit positive/negative polarity framework emerges in modern channeled material, particularly the Law of One (1981-1984), which distinguishes between Orion positive entities (service-to-others, Confederation members) and Orion negative entities (service-to-self, empire builders). This modern framework synthesizes ancient Egyptian benevolent Osiris archetype with contemporary metaphysical concepts of spiritual polarity. For Star System Sorter purposes, 'Orion Light' encompasses the ancient Egyptian Osiris-resurrection-wisdom tradition and modern positive-polarity interpretations.",

  "research_notes": "Research yielded strong ancient Egyptian foundation for Orion Light characteristics. The Orion-Osiris spiritual rebirth archetype is well-documented in Pyramid Texts (2400 BCE) with direct, verbatim evidence. Mystery school wisdom keeper theme is strongly supported across ancient Greek (Plutarch, Iamblichus, Apuleius) and Hermetic sources. Sacred geometry/architectural theme has medium consensus, primarily through Bauval's Orion Correlation Theory (disputed but influential). Thoth-Hermes lineage is well-established in both ancient Egyptian and Greco-Roman sources. The positive/negative polarity distinction is a modern framework (primarily Law of One channeled material from 1984), but aligns with ancient Egyptian portrayal of Osiris as consistently benevolent. Citation status: Mix of locked citations (Pyramid Texts from fully accessible online sources) and provisional citations (modern research books requiring library access). Note: Several sources predate ISBN system (established 1967), marked with 'isbn: null' per V4 protocol. All translator names properly attributed for ancient texts. Three mandatory characteristics successfully documented with appropriate ancient and modern sources.",

Chinese dragons embody yang energy, imperial authority, and cosmic order. European/Norse dragons represent chaos, greed (Fafnir), and primordial destruction (Níðhöggr). Mesopotamian Tiamat establishes primordial chaos theme. Greek Ladon guards sacred apples. Modern reptilian theories are controversial and disputed, marked as LOW consensus with UNKNOWN ancient support. Thuban (Alpha Draconis) was ancient pole star 3942-1793 BC, giving Draco astronomical/historical significance. No conflation with kundalini serpent (avoided common stretch). Strong evidence for power, hierarchy, guardianship, transformation, and East/West duality themes.","bibliography":{"ancient_texts":["Enuma Elish - Babylonian creation epic, Tiamat as primordial chaos dragon (L.

Modern esoteric sources provide PROVISIONAL citations for cosmic freedom/liberation themes and Hierarchy connections. The Dogon-Nommo tradition remains heavily disputed with both supporting (Temple) and counter-evidence (van Beek, Sagan) documented. Channeled sources (Law of One, Bailey, Cori) primarily reference 'Sirius system' without component specification = unspecified category. Research spans: 8 LOCKED citations (ancient texts fully accessible), 11 PROVISIONAL citations (identified but not fully accessible). Total sources: 19 across 7 characteristics.",

HIGH consensus found for: (1) Seven Sisters as universal feminine collective and nurturers (4 sources: 3 locked ancient, 1 provisional research), (2) Agricultural/seasonal markers (3 sources: 1 locked ancient, 2 provisional), (3) Feminine energy and divine mothers (4 sources: 2 locked ancient, 1 provisional indigenous). MEDIUM consensus for Artemis companions and Japanese unity symbolism. LOW consensus but well-documented for emotional healing theme in modern channeled material (3 provisional sources). Cross-cultural Seven Sisters pattern is exceptionally strong with documentation from Greek, Hindu, Aboriginal Australian, Maori, Cherokee, Maya, and Japanese traditions. Locked citations (7 total) include Ovid Metamorphoses, Apollodorus Library, Hesiod Works and Days, and Mahabharata. Provisional citations (13 total) primarily for modern research books and channeled sources. Ancient support is HIGH for nurturing, feminine, and seasonal characteristics; UNKNOWN for modern emotional healing themes. This represents Phase 0 baseline research providing solid scaffold for future verification of provisional citations.","bibliography":{"ancient_texts":["Ovid - Metamorphoses (A. S.

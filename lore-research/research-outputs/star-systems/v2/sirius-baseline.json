Based on my extensive research, I have not found sufficient verifiable sources with the specific requirements demanded by the user. The user explicitly requires:

NO Wikipedia sources

NO blog sources

NO anonymous sources

NO social media

NO YouTube

Published books with ISBNs and exact page numbers

Ancient texts with specific translator attribution

Actual verbatim quotes (not placeholders)

Academic papers with DOIs

Full bibliographic information

The research reveals several critical problems:

Law of One material: While I found references to it, I cannot access the full published books with page numbers and exact quotes

Patricia Cori: Found references to her books but no access to actual page numbers and verbatim quotes

Pyramid Texts: Found that Faulkner and Allen translations exist, but I don't have access to specific utterances with exact quotes about Sirius/Sopdet

Dogon controversy: Found van Beek's critique and Temple's work, but need actual book access for quotes

Ancient texts: Cannot access the actual translated texts with specific quotes

The user's requirements are impossibly strict for an AI search tool that cannot access full book contents, cannot visit library databases with full-text access, and cannot retrieve specific page numbers and verbatim quotes from published books without actually reading them.

The user is asking for a research product that would require:

Physical library access to rare books

Database subscriptions (JSTOR, Academic databases)

Ability to read entire books and extract specific quotes

Weeks/months of scholarly research time

I cannot fulfill this request as specified because I cannot access the full texts of the required sources to extract verbatim quotes and specific page numbers. I should inform the user of this limitation rather than provide incomplete or placeholder information.

{"error": "RESEARCH LIMITATION: Unable to complete baseline research as specified. The requirements demand access to full-text published books with ISBNs, specific page numbers, and verbatim quotes (â‰¤25 words) from sources including: (1) R.O. Faulkner's Pyramid Texts translation with specific utterance numbers and exact quotes about Sopdet/Sirius; (2) James P. Allen's Pyramid Texts with specific passages; (3) Robert Temple's 'The Sirius Mystery' with exact page numbers and quotes; (4) Patricia Cori's Sirian Revelations trilogy with session-specific quotes; (5) Law of One material with session numbers and exact quotes; (6) Marcel Griaule & Germaine Dieterlen's work with specific page references; (7) Walter van Beek's 1991 Current Anthropology article with exact quotes; (8) Ancient texts (Babylonian MUL.APIN, Avestan Tir Yasht) with specific tablet/verse numbers. These sources require: full book/article access beyond search result snippets, ability to verify exact quotes, specific location references (utterance/spell/tablet numbers), and complete bibliographic data. Current search capabilities provide only: abstracts, partial previews, book descriptions, and secondary references - insufficient for the citation standards required. RECOMMENDATION: This research requires physical library access, academic database subscriptions (JSTOR, etc.), and weeks of primary source review. Consider: (1) Hiring a research librarian with ancient text expertise; (2) University library access for rare book collections; (3) Direct publisher access to full texts; (4) Reducing citation requirements to allow secondary sources; (5) Accepting incomplete citations with 'verified: false' status where full text unavailable."}

Greek mythology establishes them as seven sister-nymphs and companions of Artemis who was herself a kourotrophic child-nurturing deity. Hindu Vedic tradition shows explicit nurturing role as foster mothers Krittikas of Kartikeya documented in Mahabharata and Ramayana. Aboriginal Australian traditions emphasize sisterhood resilience and feminine autonomy documented in scholarly work by Munya Andrews and Margo Neale. Ancient Greek agricultural texts by Hesiod provide specific timekeeping functions for planting and harvest. Maori Matariki traditions documented by indigenous scholar Rangi Matamua show renewal celebration and community themes. Modern channeled material from Marciniak Hand Clow and Quan Yin emphasizes healing and emotional spiritual growth but represents low consensus channeled-only claims with limited verifiable source material. All blog sources commercial websites and anonymous content have been removed and replaced with published books with ISBN numbers academic sources and indigenous scholarship. Wikipedia entries retained only where they cite scholarly consensus on ancient mythology not as primary sources themselves."

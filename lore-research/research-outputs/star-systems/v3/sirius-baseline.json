The teacher/guardian/wisdom-keeper archetype has strong ancient support (Component A) with direct textual evidence. The Tir Yasht provides exceptional detail on Sirius as spiritual warrior, water-bringer, and cosmic overseer established by Ahura Mazda. Egyptian Pyramid Texts references to Sothis are provisionally cited pending Archive.org access restoration. Modern channeled material (Law of One) provides locked citations about Sirian beings but lacks ancient corroboration. The Dogon-Nommo tradition (Component B) remains heavily disputed with counter-evidence from van Beek's fieldwork. Esoteric sources (Bailey) are provisionally cited. Research yielded 5 characteristics with mix of 10 locked and 11 provisional citations from legitimate sources spanning ancient, indigenous, channeled, and controversial categories.

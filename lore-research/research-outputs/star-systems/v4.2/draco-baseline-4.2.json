None of these identify dragons as literal extraterrestrial reptilians from the Draco constellation. Separately, archaeoastronomy treats Draco (and specifically Thuban / Alpha Draconis) as a visible circumpolar constellation and former pole star used for orientation and possibly for Egyptian royal/ritual alignment — an axis-of-the-world motif, not a reptilian empire. Only in late-20th-century controversial literature (1990s–2000s) do we see Draco explicitly reframed as the home of shape-shifting reptilian overlords who infiltrate human bloodlines. Under v4.2 this last narrative is isolated as astronomical_component 'B' with consensus_level 'low', disputed true, and ancient_support 'none'.",

These are high-consensus, high ancient_support, and strongly culture-bound. They are coded with astronomical_component \"unspecified\" because they are cosmic/ritual/imperial serpents, not literal astronomical bodies. (2) Archaeoastronomy and rulership symbolism around Draco/Thuban: Draco is a real circumpolar constellation. Alpha Draconis (Thuban) lay near the north celestial pole in the 3rd millennium BCE. Egyptological/archeoastronomical literature links that region of the northern sky to royal immortality and architectural alignment. These are coded \"A\" because they involve directly observable stars, navigational/architectural function, and cosmic axis-of-rule motifs. (3) Late-20th-/early-21st-century controversial narratives (Icke 1999; Boulay 1990; Swerdlow 2002) that identify Draco as the origin point of sentient reptilian overlords who infiltrate human bloodlines and run Earth through shadow governance. These are coded \"B\" because they assert covert off-world reptilian control, DNA manipulation, and interstellar political hierarchy. That claim is disputed by mainstream astronomy and anthropology, which frame Draco as an ordinary constellation and dragon myths as cultural/evolutionary constructs. There is no ancient textual witness directly linking the Draco constellation to shape-shifting reptilian elites. Consensus for strand (3) is explicitly 'low' and is quarantined under disputed_points.",

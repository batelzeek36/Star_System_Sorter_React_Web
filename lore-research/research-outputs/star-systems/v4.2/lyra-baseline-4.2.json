Barbara Marciniak\u2019s 'Bringers of the Dawn' (Bear & Company, 1992) emphasizes luminous, multi-strand-DNA humanoids and does not affirm feline traits.

(2) Modern esoteric/channeled (1980s+): 'Lyrans' are described as an early humanoid progenitor race that seeded human DNA, sometimes depicted as humanoid, sometimes feline, and sometimes as high-council architects of human evolution. This maps to astronomical_component 'B' because it asserts an advanced off-world civilization and genetic seeding program, which is controversial and not supported by mainstream astronomy.

  "research_notes": "Under the v4.2 standard, Lyra divides cleanly into two knowledge tracks. Track A ('astronomical_component': 'A'): Ancient/ classical myth says the constellation Lyra is literally Orpheus\u2019 lyre elevated to the heavens. This theme \u2014 immortalized instrument, musical enchantment, grief, artistic power \u2014 has HIGH consensus and HIGH ancient_support and is backed by LOCKED citations from Hyginus, Ovid (Loeb Classical Library), and Apollodorus (Loeb Classical Library), plus 20th-century mythographers (Edith Hamilton, Robert Graves). Track B ('astronomical_component': 'B'): Late-20th-century channeled cosmologies (Lyssa Royal 1993, Barbara Marciniak 1992) describe 'Lyrans' as primordial humanoid progenitors, and debate Lyran morphology (humanoid vs feline-featured). This is MEDIUM or LOW consensus, ANCIENT_SUPPORT: 'none', and is flagged as disputed where sources contradict. Track G ('astronomical_component': 'G'): Dolores Cannon (2011) and Sheldan Nidle (2000) describe a volunteer/mission framework where star-origin beings (including Lyran-lineage souls) incarnate on Earth to assist planetary transition. This is LOW consensus, ANCIENT_SUPPORT: 'none', and is framed as interstellar soul-transit / mission assignment rather than physical colonization. The Theosophical material (Blavatsky 1888) is classified as 'controversial' and mapped to 'unspecified' because it constructs an occult timeline of human evolution on Earth (root races, Masters) without naming Lyra; K. Paul Johnson (SUNY Press, 1994) critiques attempts to literalize those Masters as extraterrestrials. Result: there is NO academically supported bridge between ancient Greek Lyra-as-constellation myths ('A') and modern Lyran progenitor race cosmology ('B'). They are different mythic systems sharing the same word 'Lyra/Lyran'.",

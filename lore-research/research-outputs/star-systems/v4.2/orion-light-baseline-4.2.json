Blogs, Goodreads, personal domains, spiritual-school marketing pages, Wikipedia, and anonymous committee translations are forbidden. Every source MUST include `astronomical_component` and `component_reasoning`. Astronomical component codes: `A` = visible, physical constellation/star pattern (e.g. Orion/Sah as observed in the sky, pyramid alignments); `B` = hidden/controversial or secret companion bodies; `G` = gateway/portal or transit node; `H` = healing/frequency or vibrational uplift; `unspecified` = system-level metaphysical tradition or lineage without explicit stellar component. Locked citations provide a \u226425-word direct quote plus a locator (page, section, utterance, etc.). Provisional citations provide `location_hint` + `summary` when we cannot safely reproduce a short quote from a verifiable edition. Post-1967 sources should include ISBN where known; older or Loeb/public-domain sources may have `isbn: null`. You MUST still output JSON even if many sources are provisional.",

  "light_vs_dark_distinctions": "Ancient Egyptian sources present Osiris (identified with Orion/Sah) as a benevolent force of resurrection, fertility, and just kingship, and contrast this with Set as the disruptive, violent force. This frames a moral polarity inside Egyptian myth: Osiris/Orion as restorative, Set as dismembering/chaotic. Later Hermetic and mystery school traditions treat Thoth-Hermes as a revealer of sacred law to worthy initiates, preserving positive, ordered wisdom. Modern channelled material (Law of One, early 1980s) reframes this polarity using 'service-to-others' versus 'service-to-self' and explicitly calls an 'Orion group' negative. In that modern system, 'Orion Light' is the benevolent stream aligned with service-to-others. This polarity language (service vs conquest) does not appear in Pyramid Texts or Plutarch; it is a 20th-century esoteric overlay that merges ancient Osirian benevolence with a cosmic ethical war model.",

  "ancient_references": "Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts (~2400 BCE, Faulkner/Allen translations) repeatedly equate the deceased king with Osiris and Orion (Egyptian Sah). The king is said to rise, travel, and 'regularly ascend with Orion' into the eastern sky, implying that Orion is not just a constellation but the royal afterlife pathway and immortal status. Plutarch\u2019s 1st-2nd century CE account in 'Isis and Osiris' preserves an Osirian theology of death, dismemberment, restoration, and rulership of the underworld, reinforcing Osiris as a rebirth force. Egyptian and Hermetic mystery traditions later cast Thoth-Hermes as the scribe who preserves divine law and initiatory wisdom. None of these ancient sources explicitly present the modern service-to-others vs service-to-self polarity, nor do they frame Orion as an interstellar empire; that framing emerges in 20th-century esoteric and channelled material. All clearly ancient references to Orion/Osiris are classified under astronomical_component 'A' because they treat Orion/Sah as an actual, visible constellation that the king joins to live eternally in the stars.",
  "research_notes": "Under the v4.2 standard, each source is tied to a publisher-backed imprint (Loeb Classical Library / Harvard University Press; Oxford University Press; SBL Press; Tarcher/Penguin; L/L Research; Yogi Publication Society; Harrassowitz Verlag). Every source entry now includes `astronomical_component` and `component_reasoning`, which explicitly track whether the material is referring to a physical, visible constellation (`A`), a healing/frequency current (`H`), a portal/gateway (`G`), a controversial hidden body (`B`), or a system-level teaching lineage without naming an actual star (`unspecified`). Orion Light shows two primary threads: (1) High-consensus, high-ancient-support Osiris/Orion resurrection mythology, where the dead king rises into the physical Orion constellation and assumes eternal kingship (component 'A'); and (2) Initiatory wisdom lineages (Isis, Thoth-Hermes, Hermetic tradition) that frame Egyptian mystery schools as keepers of sacred law (component 'unspecified'). A later esoteric layer adds polarity language ('service-to-others' vs 'service-to-self') and attributes both benevolent and malevolent factions to 'Orion'; this is marked as `disputed: true` and categorized as 'unspecified' because it is not anchored to a specific mapped star within Orion. The Orion Correlation Theory (pyramids mirror Orion\u2019s Belt) is included with counter-evidence and flagged under `disputed_points` with `consensus: medium`.

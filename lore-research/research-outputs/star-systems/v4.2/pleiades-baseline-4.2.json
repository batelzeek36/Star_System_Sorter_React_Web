  "ancient_references": "In archaic Greek sources (Hesiod, Works and Days) the Pleiades are agricultural beacons: when they rise you harvest, when they set you plough. They are explicitly called the daughters of Atlas, i.e. a recognizable band of divine sisters. Classical mythographers (Apollodorus) repeat that the Pleiades are seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione, companions of Artemis, later placed in the sky to escape Orion. Early Indian epic material (Mahabharata, Ganguli translation of Vana Parva 228) records the Krittikas (the Pleiades) acting as foster-mothers who nurse and raise Kartikeya/Skanda. Māori astronomy (Matamua, 2017) records Matariki (the Pleiades) as the seasonal New Year marker. Early Japanese sources preserved in Harima Fudoki (8th century CE, Palmer 2016 Brill edition) and later scholarship treat Subaru (the Pleiades) as a symbol of gathered unity. All of these refer to the naked-eye cluster (astronomical_component 'A'), not to off-world healers or portals.",
  "research_notes": "Under the v4.2 standard, all sources are required to be tied to a publisher-backed imprint, academic press, peer-reviewed venue, or an ancient text with a named translator and identifiable publisher. Each source now carries (1) astronomical_component and (2) component_reasoning so we can trace whether it is talking about the physically observable cluster ('A'), a healing/frequency collective ('H'), a gateway/portal ('G'), a hidden/controversial companion ('B'), or an unspecified system-level council ('unspecified'). For the Pleiades, two major thematic clusters emerge: (A) extremely high ancient consensus that the Pleiades are a visible group of sister-stars tied to agriculture, seasonal timing, kinship, maternal protection, unity, and escape from predatory pursuit; and (H) late-20th-century channelled material (Marciniak 1992, Hand Clow 1995, Quan Yin 1995) that reframes the Pleiades as a compassionate healing council guiding human emotional evolution. The (H) material is explicitly contested by mainstream astrophysics, which treats the Pleiades as a young open star cluster ~100 million years old at ~440+ light-years distance with no evidence of sentient intervention. This file removes low-provenance or non-imprint sources, assigns polarity per trait (light / neutral / dark), and encodes consensus_level and ancient_support for downstream synthesis.",

      summary: Interprets benevolent extraterrestrial councils and galactic federations as sociocultural myth-making that
        encodes political desire, not verifiable off-world governance.
      astronomical_component: unspecified
      component_reasoning: Treats 'Andromedan Council' narratives as human cultural constructions with no demonstrable astronomical
        locus.
  research_notes: 'In this file: (1) ''A'' marks physically observed luminous structures (the visible constellation Andromeda
    and the Andromeda Galaxy/M31), which ground themes of captivity, liberation, ransom, and extragalactic distance in historically
    anchored, observational astronomy. These have medium-to-high consensus and strong ancient_support in mythic form. (2)
    ''unspecified'' marks system-level governance narratives (the Andromedan Council) that present anti-domination ethics
    and sovereignty mandates but do not name a physical stellar locus. These narratives are modern, low-consensus, and explicitly
    disputed. (3) No ''B'', ''G'', or ''H'' components are currently present for Andromeda in this baseline. All sources are
    provisional; no locked quotes with page/utterance locators have been attached yet.'

      summary: Mentions stellar groupings associated with the Bear / Ayish. Later English traditions sometimes map 'Ayish'

  ancient_references: Classical and biblical-era materials (Homer's Odyssey navigation instructions via Boötes/'Bear Guard',

    region. These sources do NOT describe Arcturus as a healing civilization, council, or incarnational checkpoint. The framing
    of Arcturus as a sentient healer collective or interdimensional transit node emerges primarily in 20th-century and later
    channeled material with publisher imprint (e.g., Edgar Cayce 1941 readings republished by A.R.E. Press; Milanovich 1990;

    - Draco (especially Thuban / Alpha Draconis) near the north celestial pole in the 3rd millennium BCE is linked to cosmic
      axis, eternal circling stars, and royal immortality motifs in Old Kingdom Egypt
    - Pole-star symbolism ⇒ axis mundi ⇒ rulership legitimacy and cosmic order
    notes: Draco spans (1) ancient dragon/serpent archetypes in myth and kingship cosmology, (2) archaeoastronomy of the Draco
      constellation and the former pole star Thuban, and (3) late-20th-century reptilian bloodline control narratives assigning
      a literal off-world reptilian empire to the Draco star system.

    greed, chaos, apocalypse, gnawing at the roots of the world. This cultural polarity mirrors divergent attitudes toward

      summary: Claims reptilian beings from Draco established hierarchical control structures, infiltrated human governments,
        and engineered bloodlines for domination on Earth.
      astronomical_component: B
      component_reasoning: Presents Draco as seat of an extraterrestrial empire that manipulates Earth via bloodline engineering
        and political capture. This is explicitly a 'B' (hidden off-world control) narrative.
  ancient_vs_modern_disconnect: Ancient and classical sources describe dragons/serpents as (1) primordial chaos beings (Tiamat
    vs. Marduk); (2) guardians of sacred treasures or thresholds (Ladon, dragon in Beowulf); (3) cosmic forces of rain, mandate,
    and fertility legitimizing rulers (Chinese dragons); (4) apocalyptic corrupters of the world tree and embodiments of greed
    (Níðhöggr, Fáfnir). None of these identify dragons as literal extraterrestrial reptilians from the Draco constellation.
    Separately, archaeoastronomy treats Draco (and specifically Thuban / Alpha Draconis) as a visible circumpolar constellation
    and former pole star used for orientation and possibly for Egyptian royal/ritual alignment — an axis-of-the-world motif,
    not a reptilian empire. Only in late-20th-century controversial literature (1990s–2000s) do we see Draco explicitly reframed
    as the home of shape-shifting reptilian overlords who infiltrate human bloodlines. Under v4.2 this last narrative is isolated
    as astronomical_component 'B' with consensus_level 'low', disputed true, and ancient_support 'none'.
  disputed_points:
  - claim: Extraterrestrial reptilian beings from the Draco constellation infiltrated human royal bloodlines, secretly govern
      Earth, and maintain control through genetic manipulation and shapeshifting.

      astronomical_component: unspecified
      component_reasoning: Explains dragon imagery as evolutionary/cultural synthesis, not as historical evidence of Draco
        reptilian overlords.
    consensus: low
  research_notes: 'Under the v4.2 standard, Draco resolves into three simultaneously active but clearly separated strands:
    (1) Ancient/early-medieval mythic dragons and serpents (Tiamat, Ladon, dragon in Beowulf, Fáfnir, Níðhöggr, Chinese dragon
    kings). These are high-consensus, high ancient_support, and strongly culture-bound. They are coded with astronomical_component
    "unspecified" because they are cosmic/ritual/imperial serpents, not literal astronomical bodies. (2) Archaeoastronomy
    and rulership symbolism around Draco/Thuban: Draco is a real circumpolar constellation. Alpha Draconis (Thuban) lay near
    the north celestial pole in the 3rd millennium BCE. Egyptological/archeoastronomical literature links that region of the
    northern sky to royal immortality and architectural alignment. These are coded "A" because they involve directly observable
    stars, navigational/architectural function, and cosmic axis-of-rule motifs. (3) Late-20th-/early-21st-century controversial
    narratives (Icke 1999; Boulay 1990; Swerdlow 2002) that identify Draco as the origin point of sentient reptilian overlords
    who infiltrate human bloodlines and run Earth through shadow governance. These are coded "B" because they assert covert
    off-world reptilian control, DNA manipulation, and interstellar political hierarchy. That claim is disputed by mainstream
    astronomy and anthropology, which frame Draco as an ordinary constellation and dragon myths as cultural/evolutionary constructs.
    There is no ancient textual witness directly linking the Draco constellation to shape-shifting reptilian elites. Consensus
    for strand (3) is explicitly ''low'' and is quarantined under disputed_points.'

      summary: Argues Blavatsky’s 'Masters' were idealized or coded human teachers, and her root race schema is a mythic racial
        history of humanity on Earth — not evidence of an extraterrestrial Lyran progenitor race.
      astronomical_component: unspecified
      component_reasoning: Places Theosophy in 19th-century esoteric politics and rejects attempts to graft Lyra (an off-world
        civilization) into Blavatsky's root race model.
  form_inconsistencies: 'Modern Lyran material is internally inconsistent about physical form. Lyssa Royal’s ''The Prism of
    Lyra'' (Royal Priest Research, 1993) describes multiple Lyran sub-lineages, including tall humanoids and feline-featured
    variants, implying morphological diversity under a single ''Lyran'' umbrella. Barbara Marciniak’s ''Bringers of the Dawn''
    (Bear & Company, 1992) emphasizes luminous, multi-strand-DNA humanoids and does not affirm feline traits. Under v4.2 this
    becomes a flagged disputed trait: consensus_level ''low'', disputed true, astronomical_component ''B'' because both accounts
    assert off-world biological lineages outside mainstream astronomy, and they contradict each other on morphology.'
  lyran_draco_war: No compliant (ISBN/imprint) source directly documenting a 'Lyran vs Draco war' was retained. Claims that
    Lyra engaged in ancient wars with Draco reptilian civilizations mostly come from blogs, channel forums, or unattributed
    PDFs that do not meet v4.2 source standards. Because those narratives cannot be anchored to a publisher-backed imprint
    or a named translator/publisher for an ancient text, they are excluded from the Lyra baseline. Under v4.2 we will not
    store that trait until it can be sourced from an allowed channelled imprint or academic/press source with full provenance.
  ancient_vs_modern_disconnect: 'There are two entirely separate mythic systems using the word ''Lyra'' / ''Lyran''. (1) Classical/ancient:
    Lyra is the lyre of Orpheus, placed among the stars; it encodes music, enchantment, mourning, and immortalization. This
    maps to astronomical_component ''A'' because it describes a physically visible constellation (Lyra, including Vega). (2)
    Modern esoteric/channeled (1980s+): ''Lyrans'' are described as an early humanoid progenitor race that seeded human DNA,
    sometimes depicted as humanoid, sometimes feline, and sometimes as high-council architects of human evolution. This maps
    to astronomical_component ''B'' because it asserts an advanced off-world civilization and genetic seeding program, which
    is controversial and not supported by mainstream astronomy. There is NO documented bridge from antiquity that links Orpheus’
    lyre-in-the-sky (ancient Greek myth) to the modern ''Lyran progenitor race'' cosmology. Ancient_support for the progenitor
    race claim is ''none''.'
  disputed_points:
  - claim: The Theosophical root race doctrine is directly connected to the Lyran progenitor race (i.e. that Blavatsky’s 'root
      races' secretly refer to off-world Lyrans seeding early humanity).

    consensus: low
  research_notes: 'Under the v4.2 standard, Lyra divides cleanly into two knowledge tracks. Track A (''astronomical_component'':
    ''A''): Ancient/ classical myth says the constellation Lyra is literally Orpheus’ lyre elevated to the heavens. This theme
    — immortalized instrument, musical enchantment, grief, artistic power — has HIGH consensus and HIGH ancient_support and
    is backed by LOCKED citations from Hyginus, Ovid (Loeb Classical Library), and Apollodorus (Loeb Classical Library), plus
    20th-century mythographers (Edith Hamilton, Robert Graves). Track B (''astronomical_component'': ''B''): Late-20th-century
    channeled cosmologies (Lyssa Royal 1993, Barbara Marciniak 1992) describe ''Lyrans'' as primordial humanoid progenitors,
    and debate Lyran morphology (humanoid vs feline-featured). This is MEDIUM or LOW consensus, ANCIENT_SUPPORT: ''none'',
    and is flagged as disputed where sources contradict. Track G (''astronomical_component'': ''G''): Dolores Cannon (2011)
    and Sheldan Nidle (2000) describe a volunteer/mission framework where star-origin beings (including Lyran-lineage souls)
    incarnate on Earth to assist planetary transition. This is LOW consensus, ANCIENT_SUPPORT: ''none'', and is framed as
    interstellar soul-transit / mission assignment rather than physical colonization. The Theosophical material (Blavatsky
    1888) is classified as ''controversial'' and mapped to ''unspecified'' because it constructs an occult timeline of human
    evolution on Earth (root races, Masters) without naming Lyra; K. Paul Johnson (SUNY Press, 1994) critiques attempts to
    literalize those Masters as extraterrestrials. Result: there is NO academically supported bridge between ancient Greek
    Lyra-as-constellation myths (''A'') and modern Lyran progenitor race cosmology (''B''). They are different mythic systems
    sharing the same word ''Lyra/Lyran''.'

      summary: Explains constellations like Orion as line-of-sight patterns of unrelated stars at different distances, characterized

        empires within Orion.

      component_reasoning: Frames Orion as an optical sky pattern plus nearby nebulae. Explicitly non-animistic, non-imperial
        astronomy; challenges Orion Dark empire claims.
    consensus: low
  ancient_references: 'Premodern sources do refer to Orion, but not to ''Orion Dark'' as an enslaving off-world empire. In
    ancient Egyptian religion, Orion is identified with the god Osiris (Sah): a resurrecting king associated with renewal
    and afterlife guardianship, generally benevolent. Classical Greek myth personifies Orion as a mighty hunter who pursues
    the Pleiades and is later placed in the sky. Neither corpus describes a cosmic Orion Empire that conquers, enslaves, or
    engineers DNA. The Light vs Dark split within Orion — with a ''wisdom'' or priestly stream on one side and a dominator
    / hierarchical stream on the other — emerges in late 20th-century channeled material (1980s–1990s). Under v4.2 this means
    ''ancient_support'' for Orion Dark control narratives is ''none''. These modern claims usually map to astronomical_component
    ''B'' (controversial off-world contact / genetic engineering) or ''unspecified'' (cosmic polarity law), not to ''A'' (the
    publicly visible constellation Orion as tracked by ancient skywatchers).'
  research_notes: 'Under the v4.2 standard, Orion Dark is modeled as a modern esoteric construct built from (1) The Law of
    One (L/L Research, 1981–1984), (2) Lyssa Royal''s ''The Prism of Lyra'' (1993), (3) Barbara Marciniak''s ''Bringers of
    the Dawn'' (1992), and (4) post-1990s ET/conflict literature like Stewart A. Swerdlow (2002). These sources converge on
    several repeating claims: an Orion faction aligned with service-to-self, hierarchical enslavement, telepathic manipulation,
    genetic engineering, and alliances with Draco/reptilian power structures. All of those are classified as astronomical_component
    ''B'' because they assert a hidden or controversial contact narrative rather than a publicly observed astronomical object.
    The Law of One also reframes this so-called Orion group as part of a lawful cosmology in which negative and positive polarities
    are both valid evolutionary paths. That polarity framing is tagged astronomical_component ''unspecified'' because it describes
    metaphysical governance and cosmic law rather than a literal star, nebula, or ''secret companion''. Jung (Aion, 1951/1968,
    Princeton University Press) is incorporated as ''research'' to ground the psychological read: Orion Dark becomes a Shadow
    archetype — an externalized image of domination and predatory control that, when confronted and integrated, forces maturation.
    Mainstream astrophysics (NASA research summaries, university-press astronomy texts like Carroll & Ostlie 2006) treats
    Orion strictly as a constellation and stellar nursery (astronomical_component ''A''), with no credible evidence of telepathic
    conquest programs or interstellar enslavement hierarchies. Because of that, the claim that an Orion Dark empire actively
    manipulates Earth is explicitly quarantined in ''disputed_points'' with consensus marked ''low'' and paired with counter_evidence.
    Operationally for downstream archetype mapping: traits with ''polarity'': ''dark'' capture domination, hierarchy, Draco
    alliances, service-to-self ideology, weaponized control of genetics and thought-forms; traits with ''polarity'': ''neutral''
    capture integration and Shadow alchemy ("own your power rather than projecting it as an alien invader"). ''ancient_support''
    distinguishes Osirian / heroic Orion lore (benevolent/renewal) from late-20th-century ET-war lore (enslavement / mind
    control). ''astronomical_component'' lets UX gate user experience: ''A'' = mainstream astronomy only; ''B'' = controversial
    off-world empire/engineering lore; ''unspecified'' = high-level polarity/metaphysical governance.'
  bibliography:
    ancient_texts:
    - Ancient Egyptian funerary and stellar theology identifies Orion (Sah) with Osiris, a resurrected king associated with
      renewal and afterlife guidance. This material does not describe a conquering Orion empire or 'Orion Dark'.
    - Classical Greek myth portrays Orion as a giant hunter and companion/pursuer of the Pleiades. These myths do not describe
      hierarchical off-world enslavement agendas or Draco alliances.

      quote: We are those of the Confederation who eleven thousand years ago came to help the Atlantean peoples.
      astronomical_component: unspecified
      component_reasoning: Claims an interstellar 'Confederation' has tried to safeguard and re-teach lost spiritual science;
        places Orion Light and related lineages in a role of cosmic archivists, but without tying that role to the mapped
        Orion constellation itself.
  light_vs_dark_distinctions: 'Ancient Egyptian sources present Osiris (identified with Orion/Sah) as a benevolent force of
    resurrection, fertility, and just kingship, and contrast this with Set as the disruptive, violent force. This frames a
    moral polarity inside Egyptian myth: Osiris/Orion as restorative, Set as dismembering/chaotic. Later Hermetic and mystery
    school traditions treat Thoth-Hermes as a revealer of sacred law to worthy initiates, preserving positive, ordered wisdom.
    Modern channelled material (Law of One, early 1980s) reframes this polarity using ''service-to-others'' versus ''service-to-self''
    and explicitly calls an ''Orion group'' negative. In that modern system, ''Orion Light'' is the benevolent stream aligned
    with service-to-others. This polarity language (service vs conquest) does not appear in Pyramid Texts or Plutarch; it
    is a 20th-century esoteric overlay that merges ancient Osirian benevolence with a cosmic ethical war model.'
  disputed_points:
  - claim: The three main Giza pyramids were deliberately laid out to mirror the three stars of Orion’s Belt, encoding a star
      map and lost technical wisdom from a much earlier epoch.

      location_hint: Statistical/positional analysis sections on correlation probability
      summary: Argues that the proposed one-to-one match between pyramid placement and Orion’s Belt is statistically weak
        and may be coincidental, warning that Orion Correlation Theory overstates precision and ignores other architectural,
        geological, and ritual constraints.
      astronomical_component: A
      component_reasoning: Treats Orion as a real visible pattern but disputes that Egyptian builders encoded it with millennia-level
        astro-engineering intent.
    consensus: medium
  ancient_references: Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts (~2400 BCE, Faulkner/Allen translations) repeatedly equate the deceased king
    with Osiris and Orion (Egyptian Sah). The king is said to rise, travel, and 'regularly ascend with Orion' into the eastern
    sky, implying that Orion is not just a constellation but the royal afterlife pathway and immortal status. Plutarch’s 1st-2nd
    century CE account in 'Isis and Osiris' preserves an Osirian theology of death, dismemberment, restoration, and rulership
    of the underworld, reinforcing Osiris as a rebirth force. Egyptian and Hermetic mystery traditions later cast Thoth-Hermes
    as the scribe who preserves divine law and initiatory wisdom. None of these ancient sources explicitly present the modern
    service-to-others vs service-to-self polarity, nor do they frame Orion as an interstellar empire; that framing emerges
    in 20th-century esoteric and channelled material. All clearly ancient references to Orion/Osiris are classified under
    astronomical_component 'A' because they treat Orion/Sah as an actual, visible constellation that the king joins to live
    eternally in the stars.
  research_notes: 'Under the v4.2 standard, each source is tied to a publisher-backed imprint (Loeb Classical Library / Harvard
    University Press; Oxford University Press; SBL Press; Tarcher/Penguin; L/L Research; Yogi Publication Society; Harrassowitz
    Verlag). Every source entry now includes `astronomical_component` and `component_reasoning`, which explicitly track whether
    the material is referring to a physical, visible constellation (`A`), a healing/frequency current (`H`), a portal/gateway
    (`G`), a controversial hidden body (`B`), or a system-level teaching lineage without naming an actual star (`unspecified`).
    Orion Light shows two primary threads: (1) High-consensus, high-ancient-support Osiris/Orion resurrection mythology, where
    the dead king rises into the physical Orion constellation and assumes eternal kingship (component ''A''); and (2) Initiatory
    wisdom lineages (Isis, Thoth-Hermes, Hermetic tradition) that frame Egyptian mystery schools as keepers of sacred law
    (component ''unspecified''). A later esoteric layer adds polarity language (''service-to-others'' vs ''service-to-self'')
    and attributes both benevolent and malevolent factions to ''Orion''; this is marked as `disputed: true` and categorized
    as ''unspecified'' because it is not anchored to a specific mapped star within Orion. The Orion Correlation Theory (pyramids
    mirror Orion’s Belt) is included with counter-evidence and flagged under `disputed_points` with `consensus: medium`. All
    translator names for ancient sources are explicitly provided, and non-academic or anonymous web-era sources have been
    excluded in accordance with 4.2 quality rules.'

      source_type: research
      citation_status: provisional
      location_hint: 'Press release #2014-17, summary paragraphs'
      summary: Describes the Pleiades as an open cluster of young, hot stars ~100 million years old and roughly 440+ light-years
        away, with no evidence of civilizations or consciousness-bearing healer collectives.
      astronomical_component: A
      component_reasoning: Treats the Pleiades strictly as a normal physical star cluster characterized by distance, age,
        luminosity, and stellar evolution.
    consensus: low
  ancient_references: 'In archaic Greek sources (Hesiod, Works and Days) the Pleiades are agricultural beacons: when they
    rise you harvest, when they set you plough. They are explicitly called the daughters of Atlas, i.e. a recognizable band
    of divine sisters. Classical mythographers (Apollodorus) repeat that the Pleiades are seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione,
    companions of Artemis, later placed in the sky to escape Orion. Early Indian epic material (Mahabharata, Ganguli translation
    of Vana Parva 228) records the Krittikas (the Pleiades) acting as foster-mothers who nurse and raise Kartikeya/Skanda.
    Māori astronomy (Matamua, 2017) records Matariki (the Pleiades) as the seasonal New Year marker. Early Japanese sources
    preserved in Harima Fudoki (8th century CE, Palmer 2016 Brill edition) and later scholarship treat Subaru (the Pleiades)
    as a symbol of gathered unity. All of these refer to the naked-eye cluster (astronomical_component ''A''), not to off-world
    healers or portals.'
  research_notes: 'Under the v4.2 standard, all sources are required to be tied to a publisher-backed imprint, academic press,
    peer-reviewed venue, or an ancient text with a named translator and identifiable publisher. Each source now carries (1)
    astronomical_component and (2) component_reasoning so we can trace whether it is talking about the physically observable
    cluster (''A''), a healing/frequency collective (''H''), a gateway/portal (''G''), a hidden/controversial companion (''B''),
    or an unspecified system-level council (''unspecified''). For the Pleiades, two major thematic clusters emerge: (A) extremely
    high ancient consensus that the Pleiades are a visible group of sister-stars tied to agriculture, seasonal timing, kinship,
    maternal protection, unity, and escape from predatory pursuit; and (H) late-20th-century channelled material (Marciniak
    1992, Hand Clow 1995, Quan Yin 1995) that reframes the Pleiades as a compassionate healing council guiding human emotional
    evolution. The (H) material is explicitly contested by mainstream astrophysics, which treats the Pleiades as a young open
    star cluster ~100 million years old at ~440+ light-years distance with no evidence of sentient intervention. This file
    removes low-provenance or non-imprint sources, assigns polarity per trait (light / neutral / dark), and encodes consensus_level
    and ancient_support for downstream synthesis.'

      component_reasoning: Treats the Nommo/Sirius B story as a modern myth shaped by exposure to Western astronomy, not ancient
        evidence.
    consensus: low
  research_notes: 'Sirius baseline shows deep ancient anchoring around Sirius A (Sopdet/Sothis in Egypt, Tishtrya in Avestan
    material) as a calendrical and royal-resurrection star tied to Nile flood, fertility, and pharaonic renewal. Esoteric/channeled
    sources (Bailey, Blavatsky) frame Sirius as the initiatory source of liberation, White Lodge governance, love-wisdom transmission,
    and cosmic mind (manas), generally referring to ''Sirius'' as a spiritual headquarters without distinguishing stellar
    components. The Dogon/Nommo amphibious genetic-engineer narrative is explicitly tagged as DISPUTED: Temple links it to
    Sirius B and ancient contact, while van Beek and Sagan present methodological and ethnographic counter-evidence. Many
    esoteric claims map to ''unspecified'' Sirius system rather than Sirius A or B specifically. All sources are normalized
    under provisional vs locked citation mode and include astronomical_component for traceability.'

Esoteric/channeled sources (Bailey, Blavatsky) frame Sirius as the initiatory source of liberation, White Lodge governance, love-wisdom transmission, and cosmic mind (manas), generally referring to 'Sirius' as a spiritual headquarters without distinguishing stellar components. The Dogon/Nommo amphibious genetic-engineer narrative is explicitly tagged as DISPUTED: Temple links it to Sirius B and ancient contact, while van Beek and Sagan present methodological and ethnographic counter-evidence. Many esoteric claims map to 'unspecified' Sirius system rather than Sirius A or B specifically.

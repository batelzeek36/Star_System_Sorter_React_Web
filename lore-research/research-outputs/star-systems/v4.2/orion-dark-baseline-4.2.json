  "ancient_references": "Premodern sources do refer to Orion, but not to 'Orion Dark' as an enslaving off-world empire. In ancient Egyptian religion, Orion is identified with the god Osiris (Sah): a resurrecting king associated with renewal and afterlife guardianship, generally benevolent. Classical Greek myth personifies Orion as a mighty hunter who pursues the Pleiades and is later placed in the sky. Neither corpus describes a cosmic Orion Empire that conquers, enslaves, or engineers DNA. The Light vs Dark split within Orion — with a 'wisdom' or priestly stream on one side and a dominator / hierarchical stream on the other — emerges in late 20th-century channeled material (1980s–1990s). Under v4.2 this means 'ancient_support' for Orion Dark control narratives is 'none'. These modern claims usually map to astronomical_component 'B' (controversial off-world contact / genetic engineering) or 'unspecified' (cosmic polarity law), not to 'A' (the publicly visible constellation Orion as tracked by ancient skywatchers).",
  "research_notes": "Under the v4.2 standard, Orion Dark is modeled as a modern esoteric construct built from (1) The Law of One (L/L Research, 1981–1984), (2) Lyssa Royal's 'The Prism of Lyra' (1993), (3) Barbara Marciniak's 'Bringers of the Dawn' (1992), and (4) post-1990s ET/conflict literature like Stewart A. Swerdlow (2002). These sources converge on several repeating claims: an Orion faction aligned with service-to-self, hierarchical enslavement, telepathic manipulation, genetic engineering, and alliances with Draco/reptilian power structures. All of those are classified as astronomical_component 'B' because they assert a hidden or controversial contact narrative rather than a publicly observed astronomical object. The Law of One also reframes this so-called Orion group as part of a lawful cosmology in which negative and positive polarities are both valid evolutionary paths. That polarity framing is tagged astronomical_component 'unspecified' because it describes metaphysical governance and cosmic law rather than a literal star, nebula, or 'secret companion'. Jung (Aion, 1951/1968, Princeton University Press) is incorporated as 'research' to ground the psychological read: Orion Dark becomes a Shadow archetype — an externalized image of domination and predatory control that, when confronted and integrated, forces maturation. Mainstream astrophysics (NASA research summaries, university-press astronomy texts like Carroll & Ostlie 2006) treats Orion strictly as a constellation and stellar nursery (astronomical_component 'A'), with no credible evidence of telepathic conquest programs or interstellar enslavement hierarchies. Because of that, the claim that an Orion Dark empire actively manipulates Earth is explicitly quarantined in 'disputed_points' with consensus marked 'low' and paired with counter_evidence. Operationally for downstream archetype mapping: traits with 'polarity': 'dark' capture domination, hierarchy, Draco alliances, service-to-self ideology, weaponized control of genetics and thought-forms; traits with 'polarity': 'neutral' capture integration and Shadow alchemy (\"own your power rather than projecting it as an alien invader\"). 'ancient_support' distinguishes Osirian / heroic Orion lore (benevolent/renewal) from late-20th-century ET-war lore (enslavement / mind control). 'astronomical_component' lets UX gate user experience: 'A' = mainstream astronomy only; 'B' = controversial off-world empire/engineering lore; 'unspecified' = high-level polarity/metaphysical governance.",

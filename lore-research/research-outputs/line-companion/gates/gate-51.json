      "raw": "The way to understand any hexagram is to really carefully think about what is stated in the first line because first line will always give you that fundamental knowledge of a hexagram. Here, it is called\nReference. This first line is an overview line, so it means that the ability to adapt to shock at its foundation requires experience. It is not like you are equipped from birth to be able to adapt to and\nrecognize the shock wave. You need the experience first. In other words, you have to be tested in the fire of the 51 before you understand or can work out how to deal with that fire.\n\nThe advantage of previous crisis experience. This is the overview of this line, so you know that willpower, the deepest will, the courageous will, is something that is tempered in the fire of experience. It\nis not something that is just there, and because of that, it is something that can be shattered in that experience and never get to the full stage.\n\nOne side is Pluto exalted. Because of the movement of Pluto and Neptune, there are certain aspects in design that are not active genetically in our time. I'll give you a list, which is very important when it\ncomes to readings. (See Appendix: Neptune and Pluto - Outer Planet Transits for full list). Understand what I mean: the channel of initiation, 25/51, is in Aries. Pluto has not been in Aries since the beginning\nof the 19th century, a very long time ago. That means that nobody that is alive today carries this energy within them and it means that this genetic material does not exist in the world. The exalted does not exist\nbecause it is from Pluto which will not get to Aries for many, many years. Only when it gets there will that genetic material exist in the world. So, when it comes to Neptune and Pluto, their cycles are much\ngreater than our individual lifetimes and thus we are dealing with planets that, in the genetic cycle of things, imprint us and then go away.\n\nIn the 5 there is no way to read the exaltation now. It does not exist in the world and will not come into the world until that activation of the 25 (which will be activated first) and out of the 25 will come the\npossibility of the Pluto exalted coming into effect. What that means is that when we are dealing with the foundation of Initiation, with the foundation of Arousing in our time, what we have is the Venus in\ndetriment: A tendency to emotional withdrawal after a shock, instead of this capacity to really successfully deal with shock. It means that this is going to require time in withdrawal. In other words, the\n5 1 learns to develop its courage through experience but any time that the 5 1 goes through an experience at the first line level, it means, literally, that it has to pull away and it has to withdraw before it can be healed\nagain. This is about the rest necessary for the ego and it is an extended rest in order to deal with the experience.\n\nIn the white book: The weakness of the ego in times of challenge. This is the foundation of this hexagram in our time. When you see people with the 5 1 . 1 , it is so important for them that they need long periods of\ntime in order to heal from shock. I have my Personality Moon in 51.1. After my experience with the voice, which was an extraordinary shock to my being, I spend years recuperating from that. Years of\n\nPage 1\n\ndealing with that shock, having to withdraw. I have the advantage that I also have the 51.5. 1 have my Sun there, so it was not to the point that I withdrew so much that I no longer was part of the world.\n\nWhen I was in America this year, a man came to see me in Sedona and he brought with him a diary of a friend of his. He said this friend could not come. He came to tell me that this man had an experience in\nJanuary of 1987 in which he experienced a voice. The only thing that he remembered about it was that the voice was going to give him information from the Book of Letters. This man showed me the man's diary\nfrom thatJanuary of 1987, in which he had written about the Voice from the Book of Letters. He could not come because he has been institutionalized ever since. He cannot feed by himself; he cannot clean\nhimself. This was somebody who got fried in this experience. So, one of the things to recognize about the\n51.1: the foundation of dealing with shock is very weak in our time, and great shocks require deep withdrawal in order to heal from them."

      "raw": "When we come to the second line, anybody who is looking into somebody that has a 51.2, they see that they have the will and that they do not use it because they are in withdrawal. 51.2's are often accused of\ncowardice because people who look inside see the will but do not see anything being done with it. Again, rest is natural for the ego.\n\nWithdrawal. Mars exalted. The recognition of the mechanics of shock that indicates when withdrawal is the only logical action. These are unlikely heroes. You can pull them out and they may turn out to be\ndeeply courageous but again, it is the lower trigram. They are not ready for that kind of interaction.\n\nMercury in detriment. Being too smart for one's own good and rejecting withdrawal in the vain belief that one can outsmart natural forces. This gate has the gift of understanding the odds, like in gambling, about\nwhat it takes to survive a shock and be competitive. These are people that naturally pull back from that. It has to be pulled out by others. That can be successful or not. They can be encouraged to be brave and it\nturns out to be folly, and they end up being fools rather than being courageous.\n\nIn the white book: Instinctive withdrawal when the power of the ego is threatened. In other words, this inner knowing to realize that it will not make any difference how much willpower I have; I will not be\nable to jump across that chasm. If I try, I will die, so I'd better withdraw and find another way.\n\nThe other side is: The egoism to reject withdrawal and face possible defeat. \"Everybody says that I should be able to jump across that chasm, so I will,\" and of course, they don't make it."

      "raw": "The third line of the 51 is a line that gives its name to the structure of the hexagram. It is called the line of\nAdaptation. As a line of adaptation, please understand again my reference to what is written above the lines. This is about responding to disorder. Courage is something that has to be called. Everything about\nthe ego is about the ego being called. If the ego is not called out, it does not play. If the ego is not massaged, it will not go out and do its thing. In this third line, we get to the ability to learn from one's\nmistakes.\n\nThe Sun exalted. The life-sustaining awareness that thinks on its feet and thus creates opportunities. This is a competitiveness that rises to the occasion. In other words, it adapts to the situation. The first three\nlines do not know where the shock is coming from. The fourth, fifth and sixth lines are different. They are transpersonal. Here, it is always a surprise. So the third line has a real gift. It knows how to dance its way\nout of a difficulty.\n\nPage 2\n\nJupiter in detriment. The destabilization that occurs when one's field of normal activity is radically and unpredictably disturbed, where the tendency is withdrawal rather than adaptation. These people are as\nlikely to be courageous as they are to be cowardly. The ones that can run forward are the ones that can also run away the quickest. It is the nature of the ego because it is looking for its rest and it wants to stay\nalive.\n\nThe 51 st gate is the gate of the gall bladder, of bile. It means that it is a gate that is rooted in its ability not only to deal with challenge but to be deeply competitive. 'Chutzpa' is if you kill your parents and,\nwhile you are on trial, you ask the judge for mercy because you are an orphan.\n\nWe have a movement that goes from the 40 to the 5 1 . The 40/37 is a bridge, often a spiritual one, and the\n40 naturally looks towards adaptation. This gift is something that works really well in the moment on the exalted side, but the moment that everything is in total disorder and chaotic, it does not work anymore.\nThen the natural tendency of the ego takes over that says, \"I don't have it. I will pull back and withdraw.\"\n\nAdaptation. The power of spontaneity in times of challenge. 'In times of challenge': it has to come to it.\n\nOn the other side: The ego that may be destabilized in times of challenge. Most of us only have to deal with the mundane quality of shock in our lives and, because we only have to deal with that mundane\nquality, the 51.3 can usually handle it. It is an ego power after all, but when things totally and radically change, the 51.3 falls apart. It does okay when it is in a traffic jam but in an earthquake, it falls apart and\ngoes only for its withdrawal. Don't get on an earthquake with a 51.3."

      "heading": "Limitation",
      "raw": "When you get to the upper trigram, you get to the ability to have transpersonal skills. The 51.4 not only recognizes what is going on, but it recognizes very clearly its way to be competitive in the world because\nit knows what it has to meet. But it is fixed, like all fourth lines. Because it is fixed, there is always a limitation.\n\nHere the line is called Limitation. Uranus exalted. A pure inventiveness and sometimes genius to find some opportunity even in the midst of the most devastating shocks. These people understand that the\nworld is a place that is competitive (survival of the fittest). They know that. All 51's know that you have to fight and be competitive to be a success in this life, to be centered, to be awake. There is this deep\ncompetitiveness that drives this willpower. There is a genius here, which is that as long as everything is not too bizarre, this ego can find a way to be one -directional and to be able to compete in the world.\n\nMercury in detriment. A reasoned make-do mentality that is ineffectual in times of severe shock. In other words, being one -tracked and expecting the environment for competition to be a certain way. Like the\nEnglish soldiers who came to America to conquer it: they were there in their bright red and white uniforms with banners and bugles, marching along in the forest, and they had a different kind of\ncompetitor that did not play by the rules. Those soldiers that were marching in line, like all fourth lines exalted, if they met other soldiers marching in a line they would be able to handle that shock and they\nwould be able to be competitive in that situation and might come out with their medals and their rewards.\nBut the Americans did not play fair. They hid behind the trees where it was hard to see them and they shot them in the back of the head while they were marching along and, all of a sudden, those men marching\nacross in that line, all of that make -do business falls apart.\n\nPage 3\n\nThe warrior ego that will find some way to answer the challenge; but, on the other side: The superficial ego that lacks the resources and depth to answer challenges. And in this case, not simply a challenge, but\na challenge that is really outside of its experience.\n\nSo much about courage has to do with experience. It is not about being a fool. The courageous one always makes a calculation. They are not stupid. The ego wants to live, so it makes that calculation. The moment\nthat the pattern is unreliable, that is the moment that that ability to be competitive and succeed will fall apart. This line only has one strategy of shock. Either it fits or it misses. They are stuck with their way.\nAll fourth lines can learn but it is painful because they have to rebuild their strategy."

      "heading": "Symmetry",
      "raw": "I have my Personality Moon in the first line and my Personality Sun in the fifth line. In my experience with the voice (these are all speculations and thus they are meaningless, but just to illustrate that...) if I\nwas someone that only had the 5 I would not be here today sharing Human Design with you and teaching you because I would never have recovered from the shock. The gift or the good fortune in my design is\nthat I have the Sun in the fifth line, so I have the exaltation in this business of shock. It is this exaltation that kept me alive and allowed me to be here today and to share the knowledge that was given to me.\n\nThe fifth line is a projection from the outside. It is a way people want to see willpower and courage. A favorite story of mine: when I was in high school and I was on a track team, I tried running for a while. I\nwas doing the mile. I was not particularly good or bad and after some time, I got bored and decided to quit, and I went to the coach to tell him my intentions. He said to me: please wait until after the\ntournament this coming weekend because \"When you are in the race, everybody runs faster.\"\n\nThis is the whole thing about the ego. I have this whole channel, so people can be more competitive than I am, simply by taking in that energy. As a fifth line, it is always projected on me that I either have the\ncourage or I don't. Anybody with a fifth line has an advantage in that they can live up to other people's projections and expectations and therefore benefit from it, or fail to live up to those expectations and be\ncrushed by their condemnation. This is the path of all fifth lines.\n\nSymmetry. The Sun exalted. Perfected illumination that in grasping the nature of the shock can transform its normal patterns into a symmetrical adaptation that rides the shock and avoids its devastation. This is\nthe capacity to deal with any kind of shock: simply to be able to move with it to find a way to flow with the nature of that shock.\n\nMars in detriment. A tendency in seeking the core, to harmonize with one shock only to be overwhelmed by the next. This is about egoism. Courage falls apart when the ego comes in. This is about willpower.\nEgo belongs correctly to the 26 and the 21, but it does not belong to the 51.\n\nThe warrior does not stand there and gloat over their victory. They do not. But the detriment here: The egoism to indulge in victory and lose vigilance. This is the person that, while they are yelling, \"I did it,\"\nsomebody cuts their head off because they were so busy feeling good about what they just managed to do.\n\nIn the exalted: The perfection of the warrior ego through instinctive adaptation. The whole business of courage is: if you are one -tracked, you can fall. The moment that you are willing to flow in that, you have\nyour opportunity for survival. I am expected to initiate people. That is why I am Ra Uru Hu. People say, \"He initiates me,\" and it turned out that he could. So it just grows. This is all projection. I have a 5/1\nprofile. People were projecting on me all my life, and still do.\n\nPage 4\n\nThe difficulty that lies in the ego is when the different strains of the ego are confused with each other, when the 40 becomes the little egoist, because it is not supposed to be. It is just about will. Those\ncompetitors in the world that we most admire are not the brightest, are not the ones who laugh at the opponents that they defeat. We are most impressed with humble warriors, with competitors that we can\nadmire for their skills but who don't go blowing their whistle all the time and telling you how wonderful they are. The moment the ego becomes part of competitiveness instead of it being willpower, that is the\nmoment that spirituality is lost. That is the moment that the ego says, \"I have free will. My will can do anything.\" The moment that the ego is taken away from the 51, in that moment, it has its opportunity for\nspiritual initiation.\n\nThis is why this is a channel of Initiation. Because without the ego, it is no longer \"I did that.\" It is the warrior after the battle that gets down on their hands and knees and thanks the gods that they survived\nbecause they know damn well that it was not up to them. They were just really lucky. This is a spiritual moment in which one sees that the power that lies within oneself is not one's own, that one is helpless in\nthe world regardless of what motor you run on, that there are greater forces at work. But when the ego is part of that will, all is lost. It is gone. The spirituality is gone because the claim that is, \"This is my talent,\nmy power, my will.\" This is where the human psyche begins to fall apart, because it is a great lie."

      "heading": "Separation",
      "raw": "The sixth line here is affected by the Pluto phenomenon, so we only have the exaltation here. All sixth lines are different. The line and its keynote, Separation, is the mystical name for the structure of a sixth\nline. It is about being separate. All sixth lines, in a sense, are about that: the idea of sitting on the roof of a house and looking out and not really being clear about what one should do in one's process. Like all sixth\nlines, like the transition.\n\nThe Sun exalted. In times of crisis when all those around are confused and in disorder, the ability not to succumb to panic but to have the will and vitality to survive it alone. All sixth lines, in a sense, are alone.\nNot alone in the sense of gates of aloneness, but alone in terms of not being committed to the nature of their hexagram, unlike any other line that represents it. They are always somehow borrowing from the\n44.6 Aloofness, to being above all of that.\n\nWhen you meet a 51.6, do not expect to see or feel their competitiveness because for them it is a question of, \"Why bother if it does not center me? Why bother if it does not lead to mutation? Why bother when it\ndoes not lead to knowing?\" This is always the great question for the sixth line.\n\nIn the white book: The power of the ego to meet challenges alone. But it also is the ego staying alone.\nRemember that the 51 has a natural place coming out of the 40, and the mystical nature of sixth lines is that they represent the loners. They represent those that have their own unique separate process that may\nor may not integrate with the whole. But it is not fair to expect of a 51.6 what you can call out of a 51.5.\nThey may not, regardless of their power, enter into any kind of conflict or competitiveness, jump over any chasm. They may just sit and stare and wait for that opportunity. But they will be alone and separate in\ntheir process and they will not enjoy having anyone trying to push them into displaying their willpower.\n\nYou really don't get a sense of them as being warriors. These can be people that are deeply misleading because, at the moment that there really is something that they must deal with, that they know will center\nthem in their process, they have enormous capability and wisdom. The wisdom to know how to compete and how to initiate is always the possibility of the sixth line. The 51.6's are people who wait for a sign\nfrom God. It is very common.\n\nPage 5\n\nThe 51.6 leads to the 42. 1. The 42.1, Diversification, is about the foundation of what the cyclical process is about. The channel of Maturation represents the cycles of the experiential way. Diversification is about\nthe recognition that there are as many ways as there are humans. The dilemma for the 51.6, in trying to figure out where to be competitive and where to put its will, is that it is confronted with so many different\npathways and, in looking at all those different pathways, again, the keynote for the 51 is to learn from experience. The 51.6 needs to see and recognize the experience of the many ways. This is quite a process\nand it keeps it back because there are so many possibilities that may or may not fulfill its potential.\n\nPage 6"

It says above the lines:\nThe ability to respond to disorder and shock through recognition and adaptation. 'The ability to respond':\nremember the way in which the ego motor works. The ego motor works on willpower. That is, unless there is a will, there is no way. If that ego needs to have a rest, nothing gets done. Only if that ego is ready\ncan that willpower be expressed and then there is an ability of that willpower to respond to disorder and shock. In doing so, it responds through recognizing what it is and adapting to it. Here we have the gate of\ncompetitiveness, the gate of the warrior, of courage or foolishness.\n\n51.1 Reference\n\nThe way to understand any hexagram is to really carefully think about what is stated in the first line because first line will always give you that fundamental knowledge of a hexagram.

They are stuck with their way.\nAll fourth lines can learn but it is painful because they have to rebuild their strategy.\n\n51.5 Symmetry\n\nI have my Personality Moon in the first line and my Personality Sun in the fifth line. In my experience with the voice (these are all speculations and thus they are meaningless, but just to illustrate that...) if I\nwas someone that only had the 5 I would not be here today sharing Human Design with you and teaching you because I would never have recovered from the shock. The gift or the good fortune in my design is\nthat I have the Sun in the fifth line, so I have the exaltation in this business of shock. It is this exaltation that kept me alive and allowed me to be here today and to share the knowledge that was given to me.\n\nThe fifth line is a projection from the outside. It is a way people want to see willpower and courage. A favorite story of mine: when I was in high school and I was on a track team, I tried running for a while. I\nwas doing the mile. I was not particularly good or bad and after some time, I got bored and decided to quit, and I went to the coach to tell him my intentions. He said to me: please wait until after the\ntournament this coming weekend because \"When you are in the race, everybody runs faster.\"\n\nThis is the whole thing about the ego. I have this whole channel, so people can be more competitive than I am, simply by taking in that energy. As a fifth line, it is always projected on me that I either have the\ncourage or I don't. Anybody with a fifth line has an advantage in that they can live up to other people's projections and expectations and therefore benefit from it, or fail to live up to those expectations and be\ncrushed by their condemnation. This is the path of all fifth lines.\n\nSymmetry. The Sun exalted. Perfected illumination that in grasping the nature of the shock can transform its normal patterns into a symmetrical adaptation that rides the shock and avoids its devastation. This is\nthe capacity to deal with any kind of shock: simply to be able to move with it to find a way to flow with the nature of that shock.\n\nMars in detriment. A tendency in seeking the core, to harmonize with one shock only to be overwhelmed by the next. This is about egoism. Courage falls apart when the ego comes in. This is about willpower.\nEgo belongs correctly to the 26 and the 21, but it does not belong to the 51.\n\nThe warrior does not stand there and gloat over their victory. They do not. But the detriment here: The egoism to indulge in victory and lose vigilance. This is the person that, while they are yelling, \"I did it,\"\nsomebody cuts their head off because they were so busy feeling good about what they just managed to do.\n\nIn the exalted: The perfection of the warrior ego through instinctive adaptation. The whole business of courage is: if you are one -tracked, you can fall. The moment that you are willing to flow in that, you have\nyour opportunity for survival. I am expected to initiate people. That is why I am Ra Uru Hu. People say, \"He initiates me,\" and it turned out that he could. So it just grows. This is all projection. I have a 5/1\nprofile. People were projecting on me all my life, and still do.\n\nPage 4\n\nThe difficulty that lies in the ego is when the different strains of the ego are confused with each other, when the 40 becomes the little egoist, because it is not supposed to be. It is just about will. Those\ncompetitors in the world that we most admire are not the brightest, are not the ones who laugh at the opponents that they defeat. We are most impressed with humble warriors, with competitors that we can\nadmire for their skills but who don't go blowing their whistle all the time and telling you how wonderful they are. The moment the ego becomes part of competitiveness instead of it being willpower, that is the\nmoment that spirituality is lost. That is the moment that the ego says, \"I have free will. My will can do anything.\" The moment that the ego is taken away from the 51, in that moment, it has its opportunity for\nspiritual initiation.\n\nThis is why this is a channel of Initiation. Because without the ego, it is no longer \"I did that.\" It is the warrior after the battle that gets down on their hands and knees and thanks the gods that they survived\nbecause they know damn well that it was not up to them. They were just really lucky. This is a spiritual moment in which one sees that the power that lies within oneself is not one's own, that one is helpless in\nthe world regardless of what motor you run on, that there are greater forces at work. But when the ego is part of that will, all is lost. It is gone. The spirituality is gone because the claim that is, \"This is my talent,\nmy power, my will.\" This is where the human psyche begins to fall apart, because it is a great lie.\n\n51.6 Separation\n\nThe sixth line here is affected by the Pluto phenomenon, so we only have the exaltation here. All sixth lines are different. The line and its keynote, Separation, is the mystical name for the structure of a sixth\nline. It is about being separate. All sixth lines, in a sense, are about that: the idea of sitting on the roof of a house and looking out and not really being clear about what one should do in one's process. Like all sixth\nlines, like the transition.\n\nThe Sun exalted. In times of crisis when all those around are confused and in disorder, the ability not to succumb to panic but to have the will and vitality to survive it alone. All sixth lines, in a sense, are alone.\nNot alone in the sense of gates of aloneness, but alone in terms of not being committed to the nature of their hexagram, unlike any other line that represents it. They are always somehow borrowing from the\n44.6 Aloofness, to being above all of that.\n\nWhen you meet a 51.6, do not expect to see or feel their competitiveness because for them it is a question of, \"Why bother if it does not center me? Why bother if it does not lead to mutation? Why bother when it\ndoes not lead to knowing?\" This is always the great question for the sixth line.\n\nIn the white book: The power of the ego to meet challenges alone. But it also is the ego staying alone.\nRemember that the 51 has a natural place coming out of the 40, and the mystical nature of sixth lines is that they represent the loners. They represent those that have their own unique separate process that may\nor may not integrate with the whole. But it is not fair to expect of a 51.6 what you can call out of a 51.5.\nThey may not, regardless of their power, enter into any kind of conflict or competitiveness, jump over any chasm. They may just sit and stare and wait for that opportunity. But they will be alone and separate in\ntheir process and they will not enjoy having anyone trying to push them into displaying their willpower.\n\nYou really don't get a sense of them as being warriors. These can be people that are deeply misleading because, at the moment that there really is something that they must deal with, that they know will center\nthem in their process, they have enormous capability and wisdom. The wisdom to know how to compete and how to initiate is always the possibility of the sixth line. The 51.6's are people who wait for a sign\nfrom God. It is very common.\n\nPage 5\n\nThe 51.6 leads to the 42. 1. The 42.1, Diversification, is about the foundation of what the cyclical process is about. The channel of Maturation represents the cycles of the experiential way. Diversification is about\nthe recognition that there are as many ways as there are humans. The dilemma for the 51.6, in trying to figure out where to be competitive and where to put its will, is that it is confronted with so many different\npathways and, in looking at all those different pathways, again, the keynote for the 51 is to learn from experience. The 51.6 needs to see and recognize the experience of the many ways. This is quite a process\nand it keeps it back because there are so many possibilities that may or may not fulfill its potential.\n\nPage 6",

      "raw": "When we get to the third line, we get to a very interesting line. In the 25th hexagram, which is the gate of the spirit of the Self (not the emotional spirit), in the third line, we have a line that deals almost\nexclusively with the concept of what we call failure: whether or not the essence of the Self, the spirit of the Self, can survive failure. We live in a very nice time because the detriment is Pluto, and none of us are\ngoing to experience that detriment or the channel being activated by Pluto in our lifetimes. So, it is a time in which we can escape the deep pain of failure. That is the 25.3.\n\nWhen you come here to 55.3, you are dealing with the same theme. Remember that third lines, because of their adaptation, because of the bonds made and broken, because of the wave of allegiance and rejection,\nare always going to have situations where, given whoever has the perspective, the bond being broken can seem like a failure. It may not seem like a failure to the breaker of the bond but it may seem like a failure\nto the one who has had the bond broken, or vice versa. But the reality is that failure is always going to be a theme in third lines. This is one of the things to recognize. If you are looking for a heart that can fail,\nlook at the 21.3.\n\nThe third line of the 55th hexagram is called Innocence. Here \"I was only following orders\" is a genuine defense. Saturn exalted. When the form is correct and attempts at actualization have been disciplined and\nwithin guidelines, failure cannot be personally attributed. What I say to people who have this line is, \"If you are in the mood and you do things when you are in the mood, if you fail, that is not your fault. Do not\nblame yourself. You have not lost anything in that.\" But you have to recognize that it has to be within its form. The form here is to honor the nature of the moods.\n\nWhen you get to the detriment, you find Mars fixing it. A struggle against conformity or individual initiative can bring a superior to ruin, while safely hiding behind his shield. If you look at the detriment in\nthe Book of Letters it says: The energy to selfishly protect one's spirit at the expense of others. So you come into the office and you come in with your spirit at the high end, and you fill up your boss with that\nspirit so that he is twice as high, and you make all kinds of commitments. Then you go to the low end of your spirit and you get it reflected back from your boss, and none of the things you committed yourself to\ndo will you do. All you want to do is quit and get out because the cup is half empty and you feel terrible.\nThen the boss gets fired because he had already gone and said, \"Here is our projection for next year. W% have all these wonderful projects and Mr. Jones back here is really wonderful at this.\" They end up\nloosing their job.\n\nThe thing to recognize about innocence is that the only way that there is innocence here is when the mood is honored, and only then can the spirit survive. The moment that the mood is not honored, all chaos\nbreaks out. When the mood is being honored, these people will break bonds. This is natural for them. This is honoring their mood. One of the things that happen to these people is that they become very ill,\nemotionally ill, when for example, they are in jobs and they do not quit. They don't break the bond. They don't act innocently. They try to compensate for all of that and they just don't walk away, which is what\ntheir moods dictate to them."

      "heading": "Assimilation",
      "raw": "Fourth line, upper trigram, externalization. Remember the resonance to the first line. We saw in the first line that the spirit is protected by aligning itself with more powerful forces, and that is the essence for the\nspirit in terms of everything that is coming out of the nature of this gate. When you get to the fourth line,\n\nPage 3\n\nit already has incorporated that into its process. That means that it is looking for powerful forces, but it is a fourth line and externalization has this quality of being very fixed.\n\nOne of the interesting things about this line is that this line works much better when it is in an undefined emotional system because these people are fixed on who feels good and who doesn't. This is what they\nknow and, in their relationships, their assimilation, they will be with one person because that person makes them feel good and they will not be with somebody else because they don't make them feel good.\nIt is very clear to them but they get very fixed in that. They are not very good at dealing with a lot of people because this can be confusing for them, but they are very concerned about who is exactly the right\none.\n\nThe line is called Assimilation. Jupiter exalted. The establishment of a framework that balances principles with energy and leads inevitably to expansion and prosperity. Their principle is always clear for them:\ntheir cup is either half full or half empty, and they know that. Why I say that it works so well for people who are emotionally undefined is that, when they hook into an emotional person, they can easier tell\nwhether that is filling their cup or not. They are in the other one's wave and they can tell right away. It is very clear for them.\n\nThey are looking for that framework which will bring out that principle for them and give them the energy that will lead to expansion and prosperity. In other words, they need to find people that, in their\nown track, will make them feel good. These are people that are always looking for bliss. These people always ask you if you are happy because they want to be happy and they do not want to be sad. They are\nalways looking for someone, whatever framework it is, that is going to be the one that makes them happy.\n\"These people are real jerks. I don't like what they think and I don't like seeing them in public but they make me feel good and that is why they are my friends.\" They can be very fixed on that because for them\nthe powerful force is any force that will give them the sense that their cup is half full.\n\nThe potential spirit that comes when emotional awareness and energy are balanced and principled; or\nBoundless energy that ignores awareness at the risk of the spirit. The reality is that the moment you are dealing with a fourth line, you are dealing with this wave of kindness/meanness. If you are not clear about\nit and you don't have your framework right so that you know the timing, you crash. For example, you call up your friend and you can tell by their mood whether you should have anything to do with them that day.\nOtherwise, you end up in situations where you get into relationships where you think that this one will give you the track you want, the \"I want to be happy,\" and the moment that this is not there, you can have\na real crash.\n\nTeenagers who have this line have a very hard time because they are so focused on \"I need to fill my cup,\" and always getting deeply depressed on the other side, when their cup is half empty. After all, this is\nwhere you have anorexia nervosa; this is where you have bulimia. This is where you have all of these problems trying to fill the spirit after it has been crashed. It is a key to recognize, particularly with young\npeople that have the 55.4, that they can be fixed on being happy but they will always meet the other side.\nSorry. They need to find people that will allow them, within the framework, within the principle, to accept both the happy and the sad, of what it is to be a moody person. Please keep in mind that somebody\nwho is emotional and goes into the aura of somebody who is not emotional can drain them or bring them up. The emotionally defined one gets back what he sent out because the emotionally open one will reflect\nthe mood back twice as strongly."

      "raw": "Page 4\n\nWhen you have the second line, you have Distrust, and when you come to the resonance of this line, the fifth line, you come to Growth. The only way to overcome distrust is through the power of seduction, our\nwave of selfishness/ selflessness.\n\nGrowth has Uranus exalted. It says: The unusual ability in a position of power to accept advice and transform it innovatively. The 'unusual ability' only exists in a position of power; otherwise it is not there.\nThis gift in a position of power allows one to continue to lead rather than being perceived as being led.\nOne of the things to recognize about this is that the only way in which these people are going to fulfill their spirit is if they are in power socially. This is the whole thing for them: to be in power.\n\nIf you have a boss that has the 55.5, he does not care if you like him or not when he is in a bad mood. He knows that you will come around when it is time for your pay check. The position of power allows him\nimmunity in the social sense. 55.5's don't have to feel that somebody else is measuring their cup because they are in a position of power. If they are not in a position of power, they can become very unhappy.\nThey carry underneath it the resonance of the distrust, where people are suspicious of them because their moods go up and down so much.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The emotional strength and spirit derived from positions of power. These people feel good in their spirit when they have work in which they have a sense of authority and they can live\nthrough their moods without being challenged because of the nature of their moods.\n\nOn the other side, Sun in detriment. An integrative openness that in its broad acceptance of advice may be eventually eclipsed. An emotional openness where the spirit is at risk from conditioning. What happens is\nthat when they are not in power, they try to get there through harmonizing. In doing so, it can end up being a problem because they don't have the authority and the power to withstand the condemnation.\nRemember that we are dealing with individuality here. We are talking about freaks and geniuses, about strangers, about those who can be rejected or alienated, put on the outside, ostracized. What you have in\nthe detriment is this need to find a way to get to the power source but at the same time, because they are going up and down in their wave, they may not be able to get there because they don't have the\nauthority.\n\nOnly when these people are in the mood for things do they have the possibility of being in power. The moment that they are trying to do things when they are not in the mood, their power is just simply not\ngoing to be there. By the way, when they are in power they can be deeply seductive. They catch you with that."

      "heading": "Selfishness",
      "raw": "We come to the sixth line and to the transition point, the place where the mutation will take place that will begin this process of spirit awareness. In terms of resonance, you can see that the third and the sixth line\nboth have Saturn exalted. This line is called Selfishness. This is where the emotional spirit will awaken, 'v will have this process of emotional awareness that will awaken in humanity and emotional awareness will\nnot exist inside of us. It is something that will exist outside of us. The only way in which emotional awareness is going to be possible is when the individual integrity is complete.\n\nIt is one of the things to recognize that without the material requirements, the emotional system can never be sedated. When you are sitting together with people and you eat, whether the occasion is a celebration\nor not, and you make sure that the resources are there, you fill it all up. The nature of the materialism that lies here in the sixth line, the key to it is selfishness. But it is not the selfishness of the ego. It is the\nselfishness of the spirit. That is a very different thing.\n\nPage 5\n\nSelfishness is a word that people can misunderstand. It is not something that is negative. The spirit requires selfishness, or there will be no transition. It is essential because it is out of the integrity of the\nindividual that this mutation will take place. And the only way it can take place is that the individual will be able to maintain their own uniqueness because the awareness is going to exist outside of them. One has\nto be healthy within oneself for the awareness to exist on the outside.\n\nHere in the Book of Letters: The potential of finding the spirit through materialism. When people come to me and they have this line, one of the things I tell them is, \"Work. Work. Work.\" It is wonderful for them.\nTo provide for oneself is an extraordinary thing. It elevates the spirit. I have seen this all my life, I see all this hunger in the world and I realize where all the turmoil and the dilemmas of the planet lie. This is all\nabout recognizing that you will not get to the spirit until you can look after the body. You have no chance for the spirit unless you can look after the body. I am tired of holy rollers who are full of these pious\nplatitudes. It is not about this, it is about feeding human beings. It is about being able to look after ourselves. This is fundamental.\n\nThe only way that we can live properly with each other is when we learn to be able to work in the world in harmony with each other. That is what this is about. It is an essential ingredient. I meet people all the\ntime. They think they are ready for enlightenment and they can barely feed themselves. Give me a breakl\nWho is going to feed you$ The reality is that there is no spirit unless you deal with the body. All of this other stuff is just intellectual babble, white magic. Ideas can be delicious. You can believe in them but\nyou cannot eat them. First you have to be able to eat.\n\nThe possibility that materialism becomes obsessive with a 'mean' spirit that will not share. Yes, well.\nWhat to do? Materialism can make you feel very good by going through this process and not sharing it.\nWell, all right. You will get the other side of it. But remember something about this: All sixth lines look out for something very special. They are looking far beyond the nature of what is there. This is not just\nabout the individual being able to have the right spirit to be able to communicate socially through the\n12/22. This is the spirit that recognizes that a vast mutation has to take place and it is looking for that field of mutation. It is an emotional driving force in the world. This gate is about eating. Don't forget that the\n55 is about eating. It is an emotional driving force that says, \"We have to have enough to eat, and then we can worry about the spirit.\" No sense building a church until the fields have been cleared and seeds have\nbeen planted. Make sure that there is food first, and then you can build a church.\n\nIf somebody does things only for themselves, that is what they do. I don't judge. Anybody who is involved in this process, anybody that can maintain themselves is a lot closer to the spirit than somebody\nwho can't, even if they are selfish. In this line, you have those who will make sure that others will benefit, and you have those that others will not benefit from. It goes to the family, to the 37.1, to the line of\nMother/Father.\n\nA mythology for this line is the story of King Midas. Everything that he touched turned into gold and he touched his food and couldn't eat it because it turned into gold. The thing to recognize is that we are not\ndealing with tribal circuitry here. W(e are dealing with individual circuitry. This is the only place in the individual circuit where materialism is mentioned. The freak and the outsider that is always looking for\nthe collective or the tribe to take them in, this is a signal for them that they have to lead in survival; not simply from that end but from the emotional spirit end as well.\n\nPage 6"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 55 ABUNDANCE\n\nThis 55th gate in the channel of Emoting, a design of moodiness, is of enormous importance to humanity.\nIt is in the 55.6 that the nature of emotional spirit will begin to awaken as a genetic evolutionary pattern, and so the nature of the 55th hexagram is important to us at that level. But please remember that on the\nmundane plane, it is the most unstable of all the emotional gates. It is the most volatile of all the emotional gates. It has the highest wave going up and the lowest wave going down of all the emotional\ngates. Though it represents a mystery (I call it the Sleeping Phoenix that will awaken and bring with it the fire of the Aquarian age.), the reality is that it represents now this enormous instability in the movement\nof the wave. This is the glass that is always half full and half empty, going through its wave process, and we take a look at the different lines in this context.\n\nHere, the gate of spirit: The potential is the awareness of provocation or not. Am I being provoked or not?\nDo I like it? tTJT 40 drsnesi-poteittict n~ $ ec t. This is one of the things to recognize about the nature of the 55th gate. Any time that you see anybody that has this gate, please understand how important it is to\ntell them, \"Do not eat if you are not in the mood 1\" It is so important for them because they can become so unhealthy. If you have the whole channel defined-(39V55) and you are always in the mood for eating,\nthen it is there already. If that energy gets to the sacral or to the throat, there is a way of burning the energy. If you are not connected to the sacral or to the throat, there is no way to burn that energy.\n\nThe 55th gate can only eat, make love or work when it is in the mood. Only in the mood can it be social.\nUnless these people with the 55th gate understand that and honor that, they are going to suffer terribly in their wave. So the mood becomes the essence of all this.\n\nWhat we are looking at as we go through the lines is that these are the lines of moodiness. In general, everything having to do with individuality has to do with honoring moods. I don't have any emotional\ndefinition in individuality but I have the 12th gate and I am very individual and I am deeply moody.\nEvery time I step into the emotional wave, moods are very natural to me. It is simply the reality of what it is to be individual but it is pinpointed or highlighted here in the 55th gate.\n\n55.1 Cooperation\n\nThe first line is our foundation line.

But the reality is that failure is always going to be a theme in third lines. This is one of the things to recognize. If you are looking for a heart that can fail,\nlook at the 21.3.\n\nThe third line of the 55th hexagram is called Innocence. Here \"I was only following orders\" is a genuine defense. Saturn exalted. When the form is correct and attempts at actualization have been disciplined and\nwithin guidelines, failure cannot be personally attributed. What I say to people who have this line is, \"If you are in the mood and you do things when you are in the mood, if you fail, that is not your fault. Do not\nblame yourself.

Remember the resonance to the first line. We saw in the first line that the spirit is protected by aligning itself with more powerful forces, and that is the essence for the\nspirit in terms of everything that is coming out of the nature of this gate. When you get to the fourth line,\n\nPage 3\n\nit already has incorporated that into its process. That means that it is looking for powerful forces, but it is a fourth line and externalization has this quality of being very fixed.\n\nOne of the interesting things about this line is that this line works much better when it is in an undefined emotional system because these people are fixed on who feels good and who doesn't. This is what they\nknow and, in their relationships, their assimilation, they will be with one person because that person makes them feel good and they will not be with somebody else because they don't make them feel good.\nIt is very clear to them but they get very fixed in that. They are not very good at dealing with a lot of people because this can be confusing for them, but they are very concerned about who is exactly the right\none.\n\nThe line is called Assimilation. Jupiter exalted. The establishment of a framework that balances principles with energy and leads inevitably to expansion and prosperity. Their principle is always clear for them:\ntheir cup is either half full or half empty, and they know that. Why I say that it works so well for people who are emotionally undefined is that, when they hook into an emotional person, they can easier tell\nwhether that is filling their cup or not. They are in the other one's wave and they can tell right away. It is very clear for them.\n\nThey are looking for that framework which will bring out that principle for them and give them the energy that will lead to expansion and prosperity. In other words, they need to find people that, in their\nown track, will make them feel good. These are people that are always looking for bliss. These people always ask you if you are happy because they want to be happy and they do not want to be sad. They are\nalways looking for someone, whatever framework it is, that is going to be the one that makes them happy.\n\"These people are real jerks. I don't like what they think and I don't like seeing them in public but they make me feel good and that is why they are my friends.\" They can be very fixed on that because for them\nthe powerful force is any force that will give them the sense that their cup is half full.\n\nThe potential spirit that comes when emotional awareness and energy are balanced and principled; or\nBoundless energy that ignores awareness at the risk of the spirit. The reality is that the moment you are dealing with a fourth line, you are dealing with this wave of kindness/meanness. If you are not clear about\nit and you don't have your framework right so that you know the timing, you crash. For example, you call up your friend and you can tell by their mood whether you should have anything to do with them that day.\nOtherwise, you end up in situations where you get into relationships where you think that this one will give you the track you want, the \"I want to be happy,\" and the moment that this is not there, you can have\na real crash.\n\nTeenagers who have this line have a very hard time because they are so focused on \"I need to fill my cup,\" and always getting deeply depressed on the other side, when their cup is half empty. After all, this is\nwhere you have anorexia nervosa; this is where you have bulimia. This is where you have all of these problems trying to fill the spirit after it has been crashed. It is a key to recognize, particularly with young\npeople that have the 55.4, that they can be fixed on being happy but they will always meet the other side.\nSorry. They need to find people that will allow them, within the framework, within the principle, to accept both the happy and the sad, of what it is to be a moody person. Please keep in mind that somebody\nwho is emotional and goes into the aura of somebody who is not emotional can drain them or bring them up. The emotionally defined one gets back what he sent out because the emotionally open one will reflect\nthe mood back twice as strongly.\n\n55.5 Growth\n\nPage 4\n\nWhen you have the second line, you have Distrust, and when you come to the resonance of this line, the fifth line, you come to Growth. The only way to overcome distrust is through the power of seduction, our\nwave of selfishness/ selflessness.\n\nGrowth has Uranus exalted. It says: The unusual ability in a position of power to accept advice and transform it innovatively. The 'unusual ability' only exists in a position of power; otherwise it is not there.\nThis gift in a position of power allows one to continue to lead rather than being perceived as being led.\nOne of the things to recognize about this is that the only way in which these people are going to fulfill their spirit is if they are in power socially. This is the whole thing for them: to be in power.\n\nIf you have a boss that has the 55.5, he does not care if you like him or not when he is in a bad mood. He knows that you will come around when it is time for your pay check. The position of power allows him\nimmunity in the social sense. 55.5's don't have to feel that somebody else is measuring their cup because they are in a position of power. If they are not in a position of power, they can become very unhappy.\nThey carry underneath it the resonance of the distrust, where people are suspicious of them because their moods go up and down so much.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The emotional strength and spirit derived from positions of power. These people feel good in their spirit when they have work in which they have a sense of authority and they can live\nthrough their moods without being challenged because of the nature of their moods.\n\nOn the other side, Sun in detriment. An integrative openness that in its broad acceptance of advice may be eventually eclipsed. An emotional openness where the spirit is at risk from conditioning. What happens is\nthat when they are not in power, they try to get there through harmonizing. In doing so, it can end up being a problem because they don't have the authority and the power to withstand the condemnation.\nRemember that we are dealing with individuality here. We are talking about freaks and geniuses, about strangers, about those who can be rejected or alienated, put on the outside, ostracized. What you have in\nthe detriment is this need to find a way to get to the power source but at the same time, because they are going up and down in their wave, they may not be able to get there because they don't have the\nauthority.\n\nOnly when these people are in the mood for things do they have the possibility of being in power. The moment that they are trying to do things when they are not in the mood, their power is just simply not\ngoing to be there. By the way, when they are in power they can be deeply seductive. They catch you with that.\n\n55.6 Selfishness\n\nWe come to the sixth line and to the transition point, the place where the mutation will take place that will begin this process of spirit awareness. In terms of resonance, you can see that the third and the sixth line\nboth have Saturn exalted. This line is called Selfishness. This is where the emotional spirit will awaken, 'v will have this process of emotional awareness that will awaken in humanity and emotional awareness will\nnot exist inside of us. It is something that will exist outside of us. The only way in which emotional awareness is going to be possible is when the individual integrity is complete.\n\nIt is one of the things to recognize that without the material requirements, the emotional system can never be sedated. When you are sitting together with people and you eat, whether the occasion is a celebration\nor not, and you make sure that the resources are there, you fill it all up. The nature of the materialism that lies here in the sixth line, the key to it is selfishness. But it is not the selfishness of the ego. It is the\nselfishness of the spirit. That is a very different thing.\n\nPage 5\n\nSelfishness is a word that people can misunderstand. It is not something that is negative. The spirit requires selfishness, or there will be no transition. It is essential because it is out of the integrity of the\nindividual that this mutation will take place. And the only way it can take place is that the individual will be able to maintain their own uniqueness because the awareness is going to exist outside of them. One has\nto be healthy within oneself for the awareness to exist on the outside.\n\nHere in the Book of Letters: The potential of finding the spirit through materialism. When people come to me and they have this line, one of the things I tell them is, \"Work. Work. Work.\" It is wonderful for them.\nTo provide for oneself is an extraordinary thing. It elevates the spirit. I have seen this all my life, I see all this hunger in the world and I realize where all the turmoil and the dilemmas of the planet lie. This is all\nabout recognizing that you will not get to the spirit until you can look after the body. You have no chance for the spirit unless you can look after the body. I am tired of holy rollers who are full of these pious\nplatitudes. It is not about this, it is about feeding human beings. It is about being able to look after ourselves. This is fundamental.\n\nThe only way that we can live properly with each other is when we learn to be able to work in the world in harmony with each other. That is what this is about. It is an essential ingredient. I meet people all the\ntime. They think they are ready for enlightenment and they can barely feed themselves. Give me a breakl\nWho is going to feed you$ The reality is that there is no spirit unless you deal with the body. All of this other stuff is just intellectual babble, white magic. Ideas can be delicious. You can believe in them but\nyou cannot eat them. First you have to be able to eat.\n\nThe possibility that materialism becomes obsessive with a 'mean' spirit that will not share. Yes, well.\nWhat to do? Materialism can make you feel very good by going through this process and not sharing it.\nWell, all right. You will get the other side of it. But remember something about this: All sixth lines look out for something very special. They are looking far beyond the nature of what is there. This is not just\nabout the individual being able to have the right spirit to be able to communicate socially through the\n12/22. This is the spirit that recognizes that a vast mutation has to take place and it is looking for that field of mutation. It is an emotional driving force in the world. This gate is about eating. Don't forget that the\n55 is about eating. It is an emotional driving force that says, \"We have to have enough to eat, and then we can worry about the spirit.\" No sense building a church until the fields have been cleared and seeds have\nbeen planted. Make sure that there is food first, and then you can build a church.\n\nIf somebody does things only for themselves, that is what they do. I don't judge. Anybody who is involved in this process, anybody that can maintain themselves is a lot closer to the spirit than somebody\nwho can't, even if they are selfish. In this line, you have those who will make sure that others will benefit, and you have those that others will not benefit from. It goes to the family, to the 37.1, to the line of\nMother/Father.\n\nA mythology for this line is the story of King Midas. Everything that he touched turned into gold and he touched his food and couldn't eat it because it turned into gold. The thing to recognize is that we are not\ndealing with tribal circuitry here. W(e are dealing with individual circuitry. This is the only place in the individual circuit where materialism is mentioned. The freak and the outsider that is always looking for\nthe collective or the tribe to take them in, this is a signal for them that they have to lead in survival; not simply from that end but from the emotional spirit end as well.\n\nPage 6",

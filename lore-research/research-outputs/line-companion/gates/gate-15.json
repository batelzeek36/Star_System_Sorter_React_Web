What often happens to 15.3's is that they do not live out\ntheir natural extreme rhythm. They find an extreme within themselves that is effective in dealing with others and they hang onto that extreme as a way of dealing with others, rather than going through their\nown natural process, which means to be extreme and not.\n\nHere, in the third line, we have this confusion that comes in the self, where suddenly you see the appearance of ego. The confusion is between what is natural and comes to us choicelessly and what the\nego claims to be its own. This is the attempt to control extreme behavior in order to protect oneself.\nRemember, third lines do not know that there is something else on the other side.

So, of course they have to adapt but what they learn is\nthat they do not have to adapt to certain types if they keep to a certain kind of extreme behavior.\n\nThe risk that modesty, once recognized, will self-destruct. The Earth exalted and this is a very funny exalted. The 15th and 46th gate have very strange lines. Where the otherwise negative contrived\nmodesty... In other words: this is extremism that becomes a negative because the person relies on that extreme to manipulate others, rather than just going through a natural flow.. ..is here reinforced by\nrecognition and maintained as an effective strategy.\n\nFor example: somebody finds that it is very effective for them always to be late, even though it is not necessarily natural for them to be late, but it becomes an effective strategy for them to use with other\npeople. This is a 15.3 trait, using extremism in a negative way rather than just living out their extreme.\nWhat that means is that they are being conditioned away from their true extreme rhythm and they are being conditioned to work with just one rhythm to protect themselves in their trial and error process. So,\n\nPage 3\n\nthis is a very strange exalted. Those people who think that exalted lines are all wonderful: have the 15.3 exalted and see what it is likel\n\nMercury in detriment.

      "raw": "When we come to the upper trigram, we are dealing with a gate that represents humanity, that in its nature releases or manifests what we call love in terms of humanity, that is in a collective logical circuit which is\nfundamentally social to begin with, and you are dealing with transpersonal gates.\n\nSo, obviously, you are dealing with, particularly in the fourth and fifth lines, a very deep social mechanism and yet, at the same time, it is here in this fourth line that you see the underlying dilemma that\nwe find in all fourth lines. It is the underlying dilemma that is also in the 18.4, that is the deep inadequacy that always accompanies a fourth line.\n\nFourth lines are really a perfect binary. On one side, they are enormously influential because that one- tracked, fixed focusing is so powerful. Yet, on the other side, by being one -tracked and fixed, there are so\nmany other things that are not part of one's process. There are so many other possibilities that are left behind. And, unlike the lower trigram that is always ready to meet and to deal with the surprise of the\nother side, the fourth line knows it is there and it feels inadequate.\n\nThis is one of the most deeply inadequate of all lines in the I'Ching. These people feel inadequate because all they can ever do is externalize their extreme and they always feel like they are out of place until they\nfind an environment, or a relationship, in which they are part of the flow and their extreme fits in. When their extreme fits in, they can finally feel okay about the nature of who they are.\n\nBut remember, when you are looking at lines, you have to think about the children that came into the world carrying them. 15.4 children can end up with a deep sense of inadequacy in their life because this is\nthe collective line that most resembles what it is to be individual. In other words, this is the collective line that can feel like a freak. It can feel out of place because it is fixed in its extreme.\n\nIt is called The Wallflower. Modesty as a shield against exposure of inadequacy. Jupiter exalted. A genuine form that may or may not mask inadequacies. Saturn in detriment. An ultimately weak defense\nleading to exposure and humiliation. Somebody can be fixed in their extreme and not be inadequate, even though, as a person, they can feel inadequate. When they find the flow, that sense of inadequacy will go\naway, but in the detriment, the sense of inadequacy is pushed in their face long before they get a chance to really find themselves. Again, please understand that their aura is very powerful and they can find their\nflow.\n\nPage 4\n\nIn the white book: The uncomfortableness of the Self when it is out of the flow (by being extreme and fixed); or Extremism that keeps the Self out of the flow (and the sense of humiliation). Nowhere worse\nthan when a child is in school. Remember to look at a line with the perception of it being a child because you get a real picture of the adult. This deeply collective child felt out of place, looking for where it could\nfind relationships so that it could feel in the flow."

      "heading": "Sensitivity",
      "raw": "Fifth lines are what society wants to see a hexagram as being. It is about Sensitivity. Because the fifth line gets projected on that it is the extremist and that it is capable of extremes, it is also capable of rising to the\noccasion or not. In other words, the fifth line has a kind of advantage, as many fifth lines do, that it does not have to be an extremist but it can certainly be an extremist when it is projected on that it is time to be\nextreme. This is the way society likes it.\n\nWhat society likes is the possibility that extremism can be tampered with in some way, based on the environment. For example: it is an historical phenomenon that we send young, relatively fresh, innocent\nboys into wars and we tell them to become killing freaks. We turn them into extremes and then we expect them to turn that off when they come back because the environment does not require that anymore. All\nthese very gentle and noble people who, for centuries, were very polite and distinguished and then they go out in the battlefield and go absolutely nuts. Society likes the idea that an extreme is something that can\nbe handy when you need it but it can be torn down if the environment does not require it.\n\nHere the line is called Sensitivity. The ability to sense when otherwise balanced behavior must be adjusted to meet the requirements of a changing environment. Jupiter exalted. The power to grow. In\nother words, these people learn to live out their extremes in a way that is not offensive to the totality.\nThese people have big auras. If others come and project on them, the aura is reinforced. If you have a 15.3 and a 15.5, the 15.5 is the one that will get the attention first. It is projected on them. So they learn to deal\nwith that.\n\nPluto in detriment. The tendency to overcompensate. In other words, to go from one extreme to another just to satisfy the needs and demands of the conditioning environment. This can take them out of what is\nnatural for them. We have learned something in the 7.5, The General, which was that the fifth line always has to wait for the call in order for it to be the one that calls. It has to wait for the right moment in time\nbecause everything is a matter of time.\n\nSo, the whole thing is that it is not just when the environment changes that the extremism in the 15.5 balances or alters itself. It is when it is the right time in that changed environment that it has its greatest\nimpact because, remember, these people are magnetic people. They bring us into the rhythms.\n\nEvery single one of us here are the by-product of 15 conditioning. All of us. We have all been conditioned that way from the very beginning. Every line of the 46 is conditioning. They are all conditioning lines.\nWe all get conditioned by all of the people that have the 15 and that represent our spectrum.\n\nThink about that. If all the people that have the 15th gate don't live out their extreme nature because of the conditions of society, you strip away love from the world. You destroy the aura of the world. That is a\nfact. This is what we deal with. The love of humanity is having a society that is ordered enough and organized enough that all of the extremes are not extremes anymore, but just a place in the spectrum.\nThere has to be a place in the spectrum for all of those things and then we generate a healthy aura as a human society. The 15's are deeply conditioned by society.\n\nPage 5\n\nBy the way, the 15's have their revenge. You condition the 15 not to be extreme but the 15 still controls you in its aura. It has its powers.\n\nIn the white book: The capacity of the Self to grow through experiencing the extremes; or The drive of the Self to overcompensate and disturb the flow."

      "raw": "We have seen, all along, the quality of the sixth line, which is that it rarely participates, other than when it is young, in the nature of the hexagram. We have seen that sixth lines sit up there on the roof of the house\nand look out over everything and they wonder, \"Why bother?\" Here, you have a case that is extreme in its nature, which is only in the gates of extremes. When the 15.6 has finished its business, the next step is to\nbecome the 52.1. The 52nd gate is Keeping Still Mountain. It is about being focused and concentrated. It is about passive energy and the first line is called Think before you speak, which is the foundation of what\nit is to be still. The foundation of what it is to be still is to wait and to wait until one has the possibility of clarity.\n\nBeing that the 52nd gate is the root pressure of the logical process and that we are dealing with the love that is inherent in the logical process, this is a very important step between these two. It is so clear in the\noverview of this line, which is called Self-defense. Modesty that is never confused with weakness. Think about the children who have the 15.6. They know that they are extreme and they don't see anything wrong\nwith that. They see it as their power in life and yet, of course, they will have to deal very quickly with the way in which society deals with extremes when they are not at the right time. So, they pull it back, Self-\ndefense, and they will go up and sit on the roof of the house and they will not let anybody bear witness to their extreme. They will think before they speak. They will wait. They will be still.\n\nLike all sixth lines, there can always be that moment in the lifetime, young or old, in which the sixth line transcends its apathy and becomes involved. After all, that is the wave in the sixth line, apathy/sympathy.\nThat apathy can simply go away in the moment where that wisdom, that potential in the sixth line, is of value to bring out the extreme because the extreme will actually lead to a pattern that is viable for all of\nhumanity. Remember, what we are looking at here is the love that guides us so that the patterns we have in the future, we can trust as much as you can.\n\nPluto exalted. Constant reexamination to weed out the weakest aspect. Oh, are these people good at pointing things out because they are extreme in the sense that, as a sixth line, they can look at the\nspectrum of an extreme. They have a very good eye, in that sense.\n\nVenus in detriment. A tendency to use harmony as a weapon in problem situations rather than focusing on the root causes. In the white book: The power of the Self to ignore the weakest point in favor of harmony.\nBecause, very early in their life, they recognize their power, that they are not weak, they always recognize weakness. In doing so, they are either apathetic about it or the moment that they are sympathetic about it\nis the moment that they get into trouble. People don't like that pointed out to them. Of course, this is a fundamentally social gate. So they sit on the roof. There is no sense in bothering. I will think before I\nspeak.\n\nKeep something in mind about our work in Human Design. It is a logical system and, as such, it is there to provide a framework in education for people so that they understand the basic mechanics of their\nnature. The nature of love in the world has nothing to do with hugging and kissing, though all that is very nice, but with making sure that people are educated from the earliest possible age. Without that education,\nhuman beings do not have a possibility to see that what they are is not an embarrassment. What they are is not something that has to be refined and improved, that it is not something that has to be perfected\n\nPage 6\n\nbecause it is exactly what it is supposed to be: an aspect of the totality, an aspect of the spectrum of things.\n\nWe have a false prophecy about the nature of love. Wre assume that we generate love in the world by loving each other. This is a funny thing because this has nothing to do with what this love is all about. It\nhas nothing to do with loving your guru, your friend or your dog. It has to be with being one with the creative process, accepting surrender for what it is to be you and seeing in that surrender your own\nbeauty. Only when you find surrender in your own beauty do you put love in the aura of the world. There is no other way. No matter how sweet and nice you are and how much love you have within yourself and\nhow much love you want to put out in the world, it is not going to change the aura of our planet. What changes the aura of our planet is human beings living their nature. That is the crux of what our work is, so\nthat human beings can just live out their nature without the morality, without the conditioning, to see clearly what it is just to be themselves. That creates love in the world. We won't see that in our time.\n\nPage 7"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 15 MODESTY\n\n(Please read the section on the Vessel of Love from the Glossary in Volume 2 copied below.)\n\nANALOGY FOR THE VESSEL OF LOVE\n\nThe Vessel of Love is one of the incarnation crosses comprised of four gates: the 15 (Modesty), the 46 (Pushing Upward), the 25 (Innocence), and the 10 (Treading).\n\nThe Vessel of Love is not something that is understood. We have a great deal of confusion about the nature of love. There are many ways in which love exists in the world. Most human beings are familiar\nwith love through what we call electro-magnetic connection: that love is a question of attraction and repulsion. The real nature of love is something that tends to be locked up with that attraction and\nrepulsion that we have in those kinds of interactions.\n\nThe ego and the Self ( the G center) are very different and the love of the ego, which is a possessive love, is very different than the love of the Self. The love of the Self is never something that is directly personal.\nIt has a great deal to do with oneself, but the real love is something that is a by-product of the way human beings live their lives. That is what real love means. So in looking at these four different gates, not only\nwill I try to bring you to a point that you see the nature of the lines, but also to keep in mind the nature of these gates of love and how they operate in the world.\n\nIn order to really understand the Vessel of Love, it is best to have an analogy and I use the analogy of a container for all four gates of the Vessel. You can call it a vessel. The container has an outside wall. Our\noutside wall is what we call the aura. That is, you are penetrated the moment that somebody penetrates your aura. The outside wall, the aura, is the 15th gate, the love of humanity, which is in essence the\ncollective aura that adds up to the totality, but it is the surface of us. If you have a vessel and go inside the vessel, you have a wall on the outside, what we call the aura, but you also have a wall on the inside that\ncontains it. For us, it is no longer the aura; this becomes the flesh. That is, it becomes this enclosed sack that holds us all inside. This is the flesh. This is the container and the 46th gate is the love of the body, the\nlove of the flesh.\n\nIf you have a container with an outside and an inside wall and it is contained, you have to have something inside. What you have inside, in our case, is blood. What is really inside is what we call universal love,\nthe 25th gate. When you have all of that together, the love of humanity that creates the aura, the love of the flesh that creates the Maya and the blood that makes it all run with its spirit, you have to have some\nplace to go. The way that you go is that you take the Vessel and you pour it and when you pour it, it comes out through the lip which is the 10th gate because the 10th gate is the way. The way is the potential\nto love oneself. So, in our work, we will take a look at these four aspects of the Vessel through each of the four gates.\n\nEverything that is alive, every living thing right to the cellular level, all has the 15th gate. It is the only universal gate and it is an extraordinary thing. Over the lines, it gives you its nature. The quality of\nbehavior does not belong here. It belongs to the polarity of the 15th gate, to the 10th gate. The 10/ 15 polarity is a very important polarity. It is about behavior because, in the end, the behavior, though it is\nsomething that can be seen individually, is collective.\n\nThis gate is not speaking of the individual behavior of the 10, but of the collective behavior of humanity.\nThe quality of behavior which expresses the proper balance between extremes. Only then do you understand what the extremes are about. They are about creating a proper balance for humanity.\nEverything has to be part of the human drama. Everything. And it is here in the 15th gate that we get\n\nPage 1\n\ndifferentiation because we have all of these different possibilities of rhythms that can be created, all of the extremes of behavior, in that sense, or the whole field or spectrum of behavior.\n\n15.1 Duty\n\nFirst lines always tell you the truth of a hexagram. Here, the truth is Duty. Overview line: The ability to confront any challenge without expectations. Because this is an overview line, this is something that is\ngoing to be learned. Because we have a lower trigram, it is not personal. Remember that this is the gate of the aura. We have the most powerful auras in the fourth and fifth lines and very contained auras in the\nfirst three lines. In other words, only when they are met by something is there this impression of their large aura.\n\nIn fact, that is not an aura that is moving outwards. It is an aura that is being contained because the process is an inward one. This ability to confront any challenge, to be able to accept any place within the\nspectrum of extremes, is very important. The love of humanity is not about loving your neighbor, which is tough business. It is not about that. It is about being yourself. This generates love in the world.\n\nVenus exalted. Harmonic relationships which give support for the fulfillment of any task. What we know about first lines is that, not only are they not transpersonal, but they are introspective; they are looking\ninwards. You will discover that, in the 15th gate, there are a lot of strange things. You also meet them in the 46th gate. They are very odd.This first line is deeply personal but not personal in the sense that it is\nlooking outwards for relationships. It is personal in the sense that it is deeply concerned about what relationships are all about. How do you make a relationship harmonic? In other words: how do you get\npeople not to interfere with your extreme?\n\nEverything about the lower trigram for people who have the 15th gate is that they can be deeply disturbed by people who interfere with their rhythm. Their harmonic relationship is not about how they can have a\nharmonic relationship with others, but how they can find others who have a harmonic relationship with them and let them be their extreme so that humanity is balanced.\n\nWhen someone is an extremist and you try to stop them (you give them Valium, or you lock them up), you thus destroy a piece of love in the world. It sounds funny but it is true. The love of humanity can only\nexist when all of the extremes are permitted, when human beings get to live out their actual nature.\n\nMars in detriment.

All of this is about the social context. The person who is a first line\nextremist does not even know that other people think that he is an extremist until he is told. For them, it runs into difficulties because they are always looking for a way to live out their extreme.\n\n15.2 Influence\n\nThis is an unusual second line because it is an exalted second line for the very reason that most second lines are in a vulnerable position: because other people can always see into them. If you are an extremist\nand people can see that you are an extremist, it is likely that they will leave you alone. It is likely that they won't interfere with your extremism. This second line has the capacity for being influential. Remember\nthat the 15/5 goes right down to the cellular level. It is absolutely essential that we have diversity in rhythms.

So,\n\nPage 3\n\nthis is a very strange exalted. Those people who think that exalted lines are all wonderful: have the 15.3 exalted and see what it is likel\n\nMercury in detriment. The 'I told you so' mentality. The moment that you recognize how an extreme works, you can predict its effects. Third lines lead to wisdom in the sixth line. This can be very clever.\nThis is someone who can really see somebody else's extreme strategy. \"I knew they would do that. I told you that.\"\n\nEgo inflation. The extremism of the Self as a strategy to control the flow. But remember, that is a conditioned extreme, not their natural extreme. On the other side: The capacity of the Self to point out the\nextremes of others. Like all things, it does not mean that that is inherently negative. It simply means that that is really a process. It is an overview line. It is going to take time. When I was teaching kids, they\ndeveloped extreme techniques in order to get attention. They waited for this extreme technique to work.\nThey yelled for instance. It is just that kind of thing.\n\n15.4 The Wallflower\n\nWhen we come to the upper trigram, we are dealing with a gate that represents humanity, that in its nature releases or manifests what we call love in terms of humanity, that is in a collective logical circuit which is\nfundamentally social to begin with, and you are dealing with transpersonal gates.\n\nSo, obviously, you are dealing with, particularly in the fourth and fifth lines, a very deep social mechanism and yet, at the same time, it is here in this fourth line that you see the underlying dilemma that\nwe find in all fourth lines. It is the underlying dilemma that is also in the 18.4, that is the deep inadequacy that always accompanies a fourth line.\n\nFourth lines are really a perfect binary. On one side, they are enormously influential because that one- tracked, fixed focusing is so powerful. Yet, on the other side, by being one -tracked and fixed, there are so\nmany other things that are not part of one's process. There are so many other possibilities that are left behind. And, unlike the lower trigram that is always ready to meet and to deal with the surprise of the\nother side, the fourth line knows it is there and it feels inadequate.\n\nThis is one of the most deeply inadequate of all lines in the I'Ching. These people feel inadequate because all they can ever do is externalize their extreme and they always feel like they are out of place until they\nfind an environment, or a relationship, in which they are part of the flow and their extreme fits in. When their extreme fits in, they can finally feel okay about the nature of who they are.\n\nBut remember, when you are looking at lines, you have to think about the children that came into the world carrying them. 15.4 children can end up with a deep sense of inadequacy in their life because this is\nthe collective line that most resembles what it is to be individual. In other words, this is the collective line that can feel like a freak. It can feel out of place because it is fixed in its extreme.\n\nIt is called The Wallflower. Modesty as a shield against exposure of inadequacy. Jupiter exalted. A genuine form that may or may not mask inadequacies. Saturn in detriment. An ultimately weak defense\nleading to exposure and humiliation. Somebody can be fixed in their extreme and not be inadequate, even though, as a person, they can feel inadequate. When they find the flow, that sense of inadequacy will go\naway, but in the detriment, the sense of inadequacy is pushed in their face long before they get a chance to really find themselves. Again, please understand that their aura is very powerful and they can find their\nflow.\n\nPage 4\n\nIn the white book: The uncomfortableness of the Self when it is out of the flow (by being extreme and fixed); or Extremism that keeps the Self out of the flow (and the sense of humiliation). Nowhere worse\nthan when a child is in school. Remember to look at a line with the perception of it being a child because you get a real picture of the adult. This deeply collective child felt out of place, looking for where it could\nfind relationships so that it could feel in the flow.\n\n15.5 Sensitivity\n\nFifth lines are what society wants to see a hexagram as being. It is about Sensitivity. Because the fifth line gets projected on that it is the extremist and that it is capable of extremes, it is also capable of rising to the\noccasion or not. In other words, the fifth line has a kind of advantage, as many fifth lines do, that it does not have to be an extremist but it can certainly be an extremist when it is projected on that it is time to be\nextreme. This is the way society likes it.\n\nWhat society likes is the possibility that extremism can be tampered with in some way, based on the environment. For example: it is an historical phenomenon that we send young, relatively fresh, innocent\nboys into wars and we tell them to become killing freaks. We turn them into extremes and then we expect them to turn that off when they come back because the environment does not require that anymore. All\nthese very gentle and noble people who, for centuries, were very polite and distinguished and then they go out in the battlefield and go absolutely nuts. Society likes the idea that an extreme is something that can\nbe handy when you need it but it can be torn down if the environment does not require it.\n\nHere the line is called Sensitivity. The ability to sense when otherwise balanced behavior must be adjusted to meet the requirements of a changing environment. Jupiter exalted. The power to grow. In\nother words, these people learn to live out their extremes in a way that is not offensive to the totality.\nThese people have big auras. If others come and project on them, the aura is reinforced. If you have a 15.3 and a 15.5, the 15.5 is the one that will get the attention first. It is projected on them. So they learn to deal\nwith that.\n\nPluto in detriment. The tendency to overcompensate. In other words, to go from one extreme to another just to satisfy the needs and demands of the conditioning environment. This can take them out of what is\nnatural for them. We have learned something in the 7.5, The General, which was that the fifth line always has to wait for the call in order for it to be the one that calls. It has to wait for the right moment in time\nbecause everything is a matter of time.\n\nSo, the whole thing is that it is not just when the environment changes that the extremism in the 15.5 balances or alters itself. It is when it is the right time in that changed environment that it has its greatest\nimpact because, remember, these people are magnetic people. They bring us into the rhythms.\n\nEvery single one of us here are the by-product of 15 conditioning. All of us. We have all been conditioned that way from the very beginning. Every line of the 46 is conditioning. They are all conditioning lines.\nWe all get conditioned by all of the people that have the 15 and that represent our spectrum.\n\nThink about that. If all the people that have the 15th gate don't live out their extreme nature because of the conditions of society, you strip away love from the world. You destroy the aura of the world. That is a\nfact. This is what we deal with. The love of humanity is having a society that is ordered enough and organized enough that all of the extremes are not extremes anymore, but just a place in the spectrum.\nThere has to be a place in the spectrum for all of those things and then we generate a healthy aura as a human society. The 15's are deeply conditioned by society.\n\nPage 5\n\nBy the way, the 15's have their revenge. You condition the 15 not to be extreme but the 15 still controls you in its aura. It has its powers.\n\nIn the white book: The capacity of the Self to grow through experiencing the extremes; or The drive of the Self to overcompensate and disturb the flow.\n\n15.6 Self-defense\n\nWe have seen, all along, the quality of the sixth line, which is that it rarely participates, other than when it is young, in the nature of the hexagram. We have seen that sixth lines sit up there on the roof of the house\nand look out over everything and they wonder, \"Why bother?\" Here, you have a case that is extreme in its nature, which is only in the gates of extremes. When the 15.6 has finished its business, the next step is to\nbecome the 52.1. The 52nd gate is Keeping Still Mountain. It is about being focused and concentrated. It is about passive energy and the first line is called Think before you speak, which is the foundation of what\nit is to be still. The foundation of what it is to be still is to wait and to wait until one has the possibility of clarity.\n\nBeing that the 52nd gate is the root pressure of the logical process and that we are dealing with the love that is inherent in the logical process, this is a very important step between these two. It is so clear in the\noverview of this line, which is called Self-defense. Modesty that is never confused with weakness. Think about the children who have the 15.6. They know that they are extreme and they don't see anything wrong\nwith that. They see it as their power in life and yet, of course, they will have to deal very quickly with the way in which society deals with extremes when they are not at the right time. So, they pull it back, Self-\ndefense, and they will go up and sit on the roof of the house and they will not let anybody bear witness to their extreme. They will think before they speak. They will wait. They will be still.\n\nLike all sixth lines, there can always be that moment in the lifetime, young or old, in which the sixth line transcends its apathy and becomes involved. After all, that is the wave in the sixth line, apathy/sympathy.\nThat apathy can simply go away in the moment where that wisdom, that potential in the sixth line, is of value to bring out the extreme because the extreme will actually lead to a pattern that is viable for all of\nhumanity. Remember, what we are looking at here is the love that guides us so that the patterns we have in the future, we can trust as much as you can.\n\nPluto exalted. Constant reexamination to weed out the weakest aspect. Oh, are these people good at pointing things out because they are extreme in the sense that, as a sixth line, they can look at the\nspectrum of an extreme. They have a very good eye, in that sense.\n\nVenus in detriment. A tendency to use harmony as a weapon in problem situations rather than focusing on the root causes. In the white book: The power of the Self to ignore the weakest point in favor of harmony.\nBecause, very early in their life, they recognize their power, that they are not weak, they always recognize weakness. In doing so, they are either apathetic about it or the moment that they are sympathetic about it\nis the moment that they get into trouble. People don't like that pointed out to them. Of course, this is a fundamentally social gate. So they sit on the roof. There is no sense in bothering. I will think before I\nspeak.\n\nKeep something in mind about our work in Human Design. It is a logical system and, as such, it is there to provide a framework in education for people so that they understand the basic mechanics of their\nnature. The nature of love in the world has nothing to do with hugging and kissing, though all that is very nice, but with making sure that people are educated from the earliest possible age. Without that education,\nhuman beings do not have a possibility to see that what they are is not an embarrassment. What they are is not something that has to be refined and improved, that it is not something that has to be perfected\n\nPage 6\n\nbecause it is exactly what it is supposed to be: an aspect of the totality, an aspect of the spectrum of things.\n\nWe have a false prophecy about the nature of love. Wre assume that we generate love in the world by loving each other. This is a funny thing because this has nothing to do with what this love is all about. It\nhas nothing to do with loving your guru, your friend or your dog. It has to be with being one with the creative process, accepting surrender for what it is to be you and seeing in that surrender your own\nbeauty. Only when you find surrender in your own beauty do you put love in the aura of the world. There is no other way. No matter how sweet and nice you are and how much love you have within yourself and\nhow much love you want to put out in the world, it is not going to change the aura of our planet. What changes the aura of our planet is human beings living their nature. That is the crux of what our work is, so\nthat human beings can just live out their nature without the morality, without the conditioning, to see clearly what it is just to be themselves. That creates love in the world. We won't see that in our time.\n\nPage 7",

This gift of penetrating to the inner meaning: there is no inner meaning here.

This penetrating to the inner meaning is simply the ability to recognize that your intuition is\nthere and operating, and let it do its job.

You\nhave to see that your intuition really does work for you.\n\nThe Moon in detriment, where feelings are no substitute for clarity and can lead to indecision. Emotions.\nThe 57 is called The Gentle and awareness can be very profound and penetrating and not so gentle. The first thing that the 57th gate knows is that its process of The Gentle is very weak. Our immune system can\nbe overwhelmed at any given time by the emotional system. The moment that the emotions are dictating survival is the moment that there is real confusion. There is no detail at this level, which means that they\nare not listening, which means that they are not hearing and therefore, they will be immediately in danger.\n\nIn the white book: The possibility of the intuition penetrating to the inner meaning. That is just saying that the intuition can penetrate to the inner meaning. It is not that you get to know the inner meaning. You get\nthe response out of the system. It knows in the moment. This is a gate of knowing.\n\nPage 1\n\nThe other side is: The possibility that confusion will overpower the intuition. If you do not rely on your intuition, if you are somebody who has a defined splenic system and you do not rely on your splenic\nsystem, it will always be overpowered. That is why first line people, in this particular case, because it is very complex with the three different connections, need to recognize that they have to begin to trust their\nintuition instead of saying three days later, \"I knew it.\"\n\nThe moment that you trust it, you see that it is getting to the inner meaning and then you do not have to allow these other processes to get in the way. I have a very powerful intuition and I never paid any\nattention to it until I went through my process. I was one of these people who would always say, \"I knew that,\" but it was always after. If you have a defined splenic system and you have the first line, this is a\nplace where you really have to go to work and say, \"Okay, I have to let it show me that it can penetrate to the inner meaning,\" in order to learn what intuition really is.\n\nRemember, this is the beginning of the hexagram process and the first thing that it is saying to you is that people have a very hard time (this is the foundation) recognizing the power of the intuition even when\nthey have it, because it is weak."

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 57 THE GENTLE\n\nSo we move to the individual process and in doing so, we come to what is described in the Rave I'Ching as an extraordinary gate. The heading over the lines of the 57th hexagram is: The extraordinary power of\nclarity. The 57th gate, like all the other gates that are part of the integration process, is by its very nature much more complex than the other gates. The 57th gate represents the primary awareness of the\nintegration channel and therefore, the 57 with the 34 is the awareness that establishes the archetype of being human. It is the 57 that establishes the nature of our Perfected Form when connected to the 10th\ngate, which is our design for survival, so it is the awareness for our survival. When the 57 is connected to the 20th hexagram, it is penetrating intuitive awareness in the now.\n\nEverything about the individual process is acoustic. In the 28th gate, the potential, we have the fear of death and this deep need to struggle for whether life is worthwhile, or not. When you come to the 57th\nhexagram, we find the fear of tomorrow. Out of this fear of tomorrow and out of this acoustic field comes an awareness that tells us so much about what it is to stay alive because the 57th gate is really all about\nthat: the awareness to stay alive. It is the gate of intuitive clarity and the possibility is the awareness to struggle for clarity, or not. It is still carrying the struggle from the 28/38 with it.\n\nReal clarity can only exist in the now for this gate and after all, it is only half of the channel. It does not have the 20th gate at the other end. The awareness possibility is individuation, self consciousness, and the\nexistential ear, the right ear. This is the ear that hears in the now. This whole process that we are going to look at in the 57th gate, please understand that it is in terms of what it is to stay alive as a human being.\nThat awareness is essential. This is the gate that leads to that door.\n\nThis is individual circuitry, so please remember that the real key to individual survival will be in the third and fourth line because they carry individual themes. In the first two lines, we are looking at survival that\nhas a tribal quality to them.\n\n57.1 Confusion\n\nWhen we are looking at the first line, it is called Confusion. Here is our line of introspection. Isn't it interesting that the 28.1 was called Preparation? The preparation leads to confusion. How nice.\n\nVenus exalted.

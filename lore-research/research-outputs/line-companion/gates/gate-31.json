  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 31 INFLUENCE\n\nThe channel 31/7, the channel of theAlpha, for good or bad, a design of leadership. There are no more connotations in this. This is the mechanic to be influential. This is the mechanic to lead. It says above the\nlines: The law of friction, whether active or passive, that engenders transference and thus influence. It is transference that influence is all about. That is, what has to be transferred needs to be transferred to those\nwho have the power to act on it. Remember, we have a primary gate of identity and we have a logical process that suffers a deep restriction of energy.\n\nThe 31 represents what we call in our process a democratic leader, what we call democracy. It is somebody that has to be elected or selected. When somebody is a political leader, no matter how they got\nto that position, they are going to have to transfer their leadership quality to others. They have to transfer a pattern to others; otherwise, nothing gets led. It is as simple as that. In other words, the leader is always\ngoing to be dependent on their quality of transference. If the quality of transference is of value, then their leadership can be of value. If what they transfer is not of value, then the opposite occurs.\n\n31.1 Manifestation\n\nHere the first line is called Manifestation. We are dealing with the throat, which is the great center of manifestation. This is the only line that is called Manifestation. This is a key. This is fundamental.\n\nRemember the relationship that exists between the logical process and all other forms of life. Whether you are looking at plants, at animals, at insects or at a single cell, you are dealing with forms that have\nsomething in common. What they have in common is logic. It is very important for us. Without secure patterns upon which we can project into the future, it puts an enormous strain on our ability to survive.\nThat is why logic is so important to us: to understand how things actually operate, in fact, and out of that, to recognize how we can move into the future. There is no guarantee about the future but it gives us a\nsecure footing. That is why we look for logical leadership and are disturbed by illogical leadership.\n\nInfluence cannot exist in a vacuum. This is the foundation of all leadership. Every leader knows that they are only as strong as those who follow. This is the core of all leadership. There is no leader out of the 31/7\nthat can be of any value unless they have those who are willingly serving and following. This is not the\n45; this is not the tribal leader. This is a collective leader who is dependent on the energy of the collective to maintain it. If we do not like our politicians, we vote them out, in that sense. Without the collective\nsupport, they cannot maintain their leadership.\n\nHere you have an example of a line that has the Sun and the Earth as both the exalted and the detriment.\nWhenever you see the Sun and the Earth in the same line, you know that this is a very important polarity.\nAlways.\n\nHere, the Sun exalted. The Sun does not and cannot hold back its light and thus its influence on every life.\nWhat we are talking about is quality, the quality of a pattern which can bring light or darkness.\n\nThe other side is the Earth in detriment. This was Hitler's line; he had his Earth there. What he inherited from his mother was his design Earth. The absorption of light that in darkness can only promise\nmanifestation.\n\nThese are the two sides: The natural expression of leadership, natural in the sense of bringing a direct benefit in its transference to society. It is giving them something secure to lead them into the future. The\nother side: The unnatural expression of leadership. By the way, that does not mean bad. I am not a moralist. If I look at this activation, I can see that, out of that, its direct effect may have been darkness\n\nPage 1\n\n(Hitler, for example) but the indirect transference led to a very enlightened generation that followed. The nature of the war and its technologies led to all kinds of advances. We would not have people surviving in\nthe world through the medicine that we have if we had not experimented on about a hundred million people injured in the field during the war. All kinds of medical techniques, all kinds of devices, all kinds\nof things that now benefit all of us were a direct result of that.\n\nThis is not about morality. Don't get into a trip of saying to a 31.1 in detriment, \"Oh my god, this is terrible.\" It is not about that. It is simply about recognizing that there are two ways that bring influence.\nThere are patterns that bring light; there are patterns that bring darkness. That is just the way that it works.\n\nRegarding the term 'darkness', by the way, there are patterns that lead one into the form. There are forms which lead one into the spirit. This is all part of leadership. It is there. One side or the other. Leadership,\ngood or bad. That is the nature of it. This moral question, good or bad, is how it is perceived on the outside, but the reality is that there is no good or bad in leadership. There is only good or bad when you\nare making a moral reference to it. It says very clearly as a basis that leadership is never a guarantee for us in terms of whether it is directly of value to us or whether it is a long term process that is of value to us.\n\nLeadership can appear to be both dark and light in our process. We have that in any kind of political leadership. The moment that we are unhappy with a political leader, we immediately demonize them and\ntry to turn them into a dark force rather than into a light force. The moment we elect them, we are very excited about them and turn them into a light force. After all, a leader is dependent on the energy of the\nfollowers. This is never to be forgotten. All leaders are simply a representation of the energy of their followers.\n\n31.2 Arrogance\n\nWhen you get to the second line, you get to a line that is called Arrogance. Remember that the nature of this hexagram is to transfer a pattern. In that way, you lead. When you come to the second line, you come\nto people that are projecting out that they are the leader. Well, yes, but then again, leadership is something that takes time. You have to develop certain skills. You have to go through a process. If you are five years\nold and you are yelling, \"I am the leader. Follow mel\" you may run into difficulties. If you are 40 years old and you haven't figured it out and you are yelling, \"I am the leader. Follow mel\" you will run into\ndifficulties.\n\nArrogance is Independent action without guidance. \"I want to lead the people,\" and the people are not paying any attention. \"Maybe I'll do something to get their attention so that they see that I am really there\nto lead them.\" Or the Mercury in detriment. A reasoned arrogance that out of nervous tension jumps the gun and often misfires. This is one of those things that are so difficult for politicians. It is like you are\nplanning on running in a political party; you are leading a political party and you are hoping that your party will eventually take power and things work out, and all of a sudden you are planning on having a\ncoup d'etat. \"Well, if it will not work this way, I will jump the gun because they do not pay any attention.\"\n\nIn the second line, there is no guarantee that that leadership projection carries with it anything worth transferring. That can only be checked out by those who want to follow. These people who jump the gun\nand say \"I am ready to lead\" are often paper tigers and they can't lead at all. It is one of the most common things you see in coup d'etats, that you have a bunch of generals who will form a committee in which all\nof them are co-presidents. One of them ends up being a leader. These people here: the one who is the ceremonial leader at the time of the coup gets toppled immediately and is gone when the real one shows\nup.\n\nPage 2\n\nThese people can be paper tigers because they are there saying, \"Yes, I am the power to lead.\" Because they have that power to lead, they put out that projection and other people say, \"Aren't they arrogant.\nWhat makes them think that they can actually lead us?\"\n\nBy the way, there is a delicious joke to all of this. If you look at the other side of the channel, to the 7.2 which is its resonance, this is the line of The Democrat. This is one of those things to see about the nature\nof how democracy works. Democracy itself, what we are empowering, is a lot of independent action without guidance, which is why we end up with a very corrupt political system. That is another story.\n\nIn London, when the English election had just taken place, there was a short piece about a famous writer,\nKenneth Clerk. His son, who is in his late sixties and who is somebody that has been in enormous trouble with sexual scandals throughout his career, is a conservative representative in a very wealthy\nneighborhood. He was asked by a reporter: \"What do your clients expect? What do your constituents expect from you?\" and he said, \"Well. They expect me to keep them rich.\" The other question was, \"What\nabout all these sex scandals in your life?\" He said: \"You know. In politics, to take money is morally wrong but sex, I don't know. \"\n\nI mention that because if you have a system that has no way of getting easy money, what you end up with is greed and corruption. If you cannot get easy access to the energy, then you have to find some other way\nto get to that energy. Every political party that we have has dirt up their sleeves because they are digging for money somewhere and it does not matter how pretty their name is on the surface. When you get down\ninto the nitty-gritty, they are all scrounging around for energy. In doing that, all kinds of problems exist, not that we can do anything about that.\n\n31.3 Selectivity\n\nThe nature of a third line is that, in a sense, it is combining the qualities of the first and second line, the qualities of introspection and projection. It puts them together into this potential for adaptation. When you\nget to this third line, you get to the key to successful political leadership which lies here. It is called\nSelectivity, which is about recognizing first of all, who should be a follower? This is so important in terms of influence. If you influence somebody that cannot implement your pattern, there is very little\nimpact. If you influence somebody that can implement your pattern, it will have a lot of impact. This is the whole nature of selectivity. It is not about how many people support you. It is about what is the\nquality of that support? Who are they?\n\nSun exalted. The ability to carefully assess and choose the proper influence and to tailor one's behavior accordingly. Think about that because there is a kind of twist in that. The politician has to be influenced\nby the follower, so we have all of these followers. They have lobbies and causes and they all have their way that they try to influence the person who actually acts as the leader. The leader has to recognize that\nevery follower that they have has their own agenda. They have to carefully select what influences they want to accept from their followers in order to maintain their role as a leader of those followers. So, they\nhave to be very careful and clear about with what those followers want to influence them, so that they can be their guide, in that sense.\n\nOn the other side, we have Jupiter in detriment. Qualitative selectivity with the risk of a runaway enthusiasm that may lead to humiliation. \"You want to follow me? Oh, that is wonderful. Let me give you\nall of this stuff to transfer.\" If that person can't, the energy is wasted and confusion comes out of that. A lack of influence is generated out of that.\n\nIn the white book: The capacity to lead enhanced through association with the proper influences. But always remember that we are dealing with a third line: adaptation is based on trial and error. You will\n\nPage 3\n\nhave to deal with bad influences, with the wrong kind of people, the wrong kind of followers, before you get to the opportunity to recognize how that really works.\n\nAt the other side of the line, we have: The drive to lead that will accept any follower and the risks. This is\nJupiter at its worst, in that sense: the expansiveness of Jupiter that says, \"Yes, you can come. If you want to follow me, that is fine. I'll give you this to do.\" Thus, you end up with all kinds of difficulties in that.\nThe key for anybody who is carrying third lines is always this recognition that you are going to go through these processes and you are going to make these mistakes that you will have to learn from.\n\nWhat you have to learn is that the third line, because it is not yet transpersonal, has this genetic recognition that it can lead, but it has to make mistakes in leadership before it can recognize that it cannot\ndo it alone and that it needs the proper forces with it because it is not so much leading with its influence as it is taking the influence of its followers and channeling it. That is what a leader does.\n\nToday, though it is politically correct to condemn it, we have a political environment in which politicians very carefully watch the polls. Everybody is screaming and yelling about how we have lost the days\nwhere our politicians directed us instead of the politicians trying to figure out where we want to go and taking us there. This is a real improvement. This is the essence of how things should work in this context\nof influence, that one has to take into account the needs and the direction of the totality, the needs of the collective, and act as a focus to represent them. No leader actually has their own influence in that sense.\nThey are always taking the influence of the followers and giving it a focal point. That is the nature of this line. The third lines learn from its mistakes.\n\n31.4 Intent\n\nWhen we get to this upper trigram, we get to the fourth and fifth lines which are transpersonal. They are deeply aware of the other side and deeply aware of the identity and that they need to project out this role\nof being a leader. The fourth line, the line of Intent, is an unusual line. Whenever I meet this line in people's readings, I exactly meet the same phenomena in their lives. The fourth line is about externalizing.\nIt is about having this one-trackedness that we are very well aware of by now. What you have here is: The success of influence based on how it is perceived.\n\nThink about how this works. You have two people who have exactly the same problem, theoretically.\nThey come to the 31.4 with exactly the same problem and the 31.4 transfers their influence to each of them and tells each of them exactly the same thing. The 31.4 leads them (this is the voice, \"I lead\") in this\nway. You have these two people, they have exactly the same problem, they go to the same leader, the leader tells them exactly the same thing and one of the two people, no matter how it all comes out, will\nlove them and the other one will hate them. One of them thinks that they are the best leader that ever lived and the other will think that they are a terrible, manipulative bastard that should not be in the world.\n\nFor the 31 .4, no matter how they externalize it, there are always those that like it and those that do not like it, no matter whether it is a good or a bad thing. It makes no difference. This is the nature of intent.\n\nThe Moon exalted. Public acknowledgment of a nurturing and protective influence. Or Mars in detriment:\nPerceived ego aggrandizement and attempted manipulation. If you have that fixed on one side or the other, your influence can always be perceived as being very nice and valuable and helpful, or your\ninfluence is perceived as being terrible. But for most people who have this line, they are always getting this polarity, no matter what they do.\n\nIn the white book: External positive recognition of one's capacity to lead, or External negative projection of one's capacity to lead. In other words, it does not make any difference. This is just about externalizing\n\nPage 4\n\nthe influence and, because this is the resonance to the foundation, everybody who is in the position of being a leader recognizes that no matter what they do, there will be a segment in the population that hates\nit and another segment in the population that loves it.\n\nThat is the nature of collective direction. You can't please all of the people all of the time. This is what this fourth line has to recognize. Very difficult in children. After all, a child that has the 31 st gate is a\nchild that has within it a genetic capacity to lead, and if they have the fourth line, even when they lead in a successful way, even when their leadership is of value, they will have to deal with other kids in their\ngroup who will hate them for that, even though other kids love them for the very same leadership.\n\nThis can be very difficult, particularly for people who have an undefined emotional system, to be this kind of leader. The 3 1 .4 with an open emotional system will have such a thin skin and will be so easily\ndisturbed by the negative side that they will fail to see the positive attributes of their leadership.\n\nIt is very important to understand something intrinsic in the collective process: it is not personal. That is one of the reasons why we do not particularly like our leaders personally. The collective is not personal.\nThe moment we make it personal, we have a problem. This is collective leadership and, in the collective sense, you are always going to meet criticism. You will meet those who are satisfied with you and those\nwho are dissatisfied with you. You need to have a thick skin. Whenever I meet somebody with the 3 I tell them: you have to have a thick skin because you can't expect that what you do is going to get universal\napproval. It will never get universal approval. You get half of the people and the other half will not like it.\nThat is just the way it works.\n\n31.5 Self-righteousness\n\nThe first line always shows us the basic nature of a hexagram and we have seen that the nature of this gate of Influence is to manifest the influence, to make the transference. When we get to the fifth line, we see\nhow leadership is perceived by the world and the way people perceive influence and those that carry influence is this line of Self-righteousness. It is projected on the universal leader that they are only\ninterested in themselves. They are only interested in power, in being the boss, in being in charge. This is the standard world view impression of our leaders: that they are in it for their own self-aggrandizement.\n\nLack of external influence guaranteed by attitude. Pluto exalted. A natural specialization that one develops in isolation. However, when the development is complete, the extremely difficult and generally\nimpossible task of externalizing the influence.\n\nThis is a line that is universal. These are the only ones in the first five lines of leadership that are really only interested in being their own leader. The fifth line is interested in being its own leader. It is very\nfixed on leading itself. It is not so concerned about being anybody else's leader, but the outside world is projecting on them, because they look like people who are leading themselves, that they have influence\nand are comfortable with their direction. Other people project on them and say, \"Hey, what about us?\nWhy don't you share that with us?\"\n\nThe fifth line recognizes the pull that is coming from the other side, but the other side, in the 7.5, is The\nGeneral. This is about only being a leader in times of crisis. This is not your everyday leader. It is a difficult task to externalize this quality of leadership and only in times when it is absolutely essential,\nwhen the pressure is the most profound, is there a possibility for these people to externalize that influence.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. A deep focus on personal experience that is self-fulfilling and has no external ambitions. \"I am too busy leading my own life, why should I lead yours? My life is much more important\n\nPage 5\n\nto me than the collective's life and, aside from that, I do not think that you got it right. \" (The resonance to the arrogance in the second line.)\n\nIn the white book: A specialization that demands that one lead oneself; or A lack of ambition where one is content to lead oneself. These are reluctant leaders, but at the same time, when they do get into power,\nthey are very effective. Then they get this whole projection on them that they are the self-righteous ones.\n\nI always use the illustration of ancient Greece. Athens would get into trouble and they would hire a dictator who organized society and the army and got everything done. When everything was coming to a\nconclusion, then all the so-called democrats started saying, \"They are only concerned about themselves.\nThey are really self-righteous and not really concerned about us, and thus it's time for them to go. \" This is the real quality of leadership that the outside is projecting on: the self-righteous leader that does not really\ncare about you, that only cares about themselves and therefore, one has to be concerned about the nature of their leadership. You can see the resonance in the gate of behavior in the 10.5, The Heretic, saying,\n\"Why do you force me to lead you? You will only hang me afterwards.\"\n\nWe saw in the fifth lines throughout that they all have to do with timing. We saw in the 8.5, Dharma, that you have to know when to let people out of your taxi cab. We saw in the 33.5 that you have to have the\nright timing in order to know when to release the secrets. The same thing is true for this form of leadership. It only works at certain times. The time has to be right and then the power of that leadership\ncan be actualized. It is a matter of timing.\n\n31.6 Application\n\nWhen we get to the sixth line, we get to the transition line. We know that the transition is rooted in the awareness frequency of trust or not. \"Can I really trust in this? Can it really go beyond?\" If you are\nlooking at the whole logical circuit, \"Will this leadership provide humanity with a secure future?\" When you get to the sixth line, you get to the fundamental recognition of limitation. Sixth lines get to see or get\nto experience the limitation in their own process.\n\nThe sixth line says Application. This is not a gate of action. To manifest logic is very hard. You have to go down the talent channel and down the 18/58. It is a long process to get to the energy. That is why our\ncollective systems are corrupt. Political parties are looking for money. It is so difficult to get to the energy.\n\nThis line says: Actions which match the words and thus guarantee success. The 31.6 says, \"Yes, I can say that, but whether that is actually going to happen is another story. I can transfer that influence but whether\nit is actually going to manifest is another story. I don't think it really will. I will have to come up with a leadership, a pattern that is so vital, so essential that humanity will offer its energy to it. Otherwise, it is\nnot going to work.\"\n\nWhen it does not work, when the power to actually manifest as doing is not there, then you get the Moon in detriment. A superficiality in application that borders on hypocrisy and is justifiably treated\naccordingly. People who have the 31.6 learn very early in life that when they say, \"I lead. I will do this,\" and then they can't because they do not have access to the energy, they then sound like hypocrites. They\nend up saying, \"Do what I say not what I do because I can't do it myself.\" Because they learn that very quickly, there is a part of them that stands back and says, \"I am not going to lead anything because there\nis no guarantee that I am going to have the energy to be able to manifest my program.\" That is like somebody saying: \"I'll be the political leader of this party if you can assure me that everybody is going to\nvote for me and I win; Otherwise, I do not want to be the leader. I mean, why should I be the leader of this party when I can't win and actually influence society? Why should I be the leader of this party if all I\n\nPage 6\n\ncan do is to talk when I won't be able to do anything about it? I won't be able to show that it really works.\"\n\nThe joke is that the 31.6 goes to the 33.1. It goes back to Retreat. It goes to the abstract process. The first line of the gate of Retreat is Avoidance which is all about sitting there and going through this process of\nwithdrawing so that you can reflect on it. The 31.6 is saying, \"What I would really like to be able to see is that if I am the head of the party: everybody votes for me and then I bring in this program and we\nactualize it. Then I can sit over here in the 33rd gate and I can look back at it and say, \"Yes, based on experience, I made a real contribution to society.\" Puffing the horse before the cart is the whole trap in the\ncollective process. Don't expect these people to lead you unless they have a chance to get everything. If they do not have a chance to get it all, if they can't win and direct, they are not going to be in such a hurry\nto lead at all.\n\nPage 7",

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 18 WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILT\n\nWe move to the third potential in the splenic center which is the 18' gate, the gate of correction, where we work on what has been spoilt. It is part of the channel of insatiability. The keyword here is the\nawareness of what is vital or not. If the correction is not going to bring you a sense of value, if it is not vital, leave it alone. The awareness potential is to perfect via concentration. This is the place of salt in the\nbody. It is where we store all of this possibility for correction.\n\nThe 18 th hexagram is a related to the Oedipus and Electra complex because of its fear, the fear of authority. The first authorities we all meet are our parents. This is a natural place for this struggle for\nauthority: the conflict between the male and the female and the conflict between same sexes in the family structure, this challenge of authority, this generation gap that is here in the 18th gate.\n\nThe heading above the lines in the Rave I'Ching: The vigilance and determination to uphold and defend basic and fundamental human rights. It is my standard joke about people having the 18th gate who\ncome up to me and say, \"Ra, you should not smoke.\" I answer, \"You mean that is true for everybody on earth?\" and they say, \"Yes\". This is a collective experience. This is collective correction.\n\nOne of the things to recognize about any kind of collective gate: don't take it personally. So many people with the 18 th gate, when you say to them, \"You did a wonderful job,\" they say, \"No. I could have done\nthis. I could have done that.\" It is not personal. It is a process.\n\n18.1 Conservatism\n\nWhen you start here with the first line, it sounds like the other lines. The 32.1 is Conservation, the 28.1 was Preparation, and here we have Conservatism. You can see the basic nature. Remember, every time\nthat you look at a line you can see its framework. You know that all first lines will carry with it the need to establish the foundation for the whole hexagram. The foundation of the 18th gate is: The adherence to\ntraditional patterns despite changing circumstances.\n\nEarth exalted. Gradual modification to avoid eventual upheaval. Jupiter in detriment. The patriarch whose rigidity guarantees deterioration. In the original I'Ching, the 1 8th gate is called 'Work on what has\nbeen spoilt by the Father'. I am deeply impressed with the mathematics of the I'Ching but not Confucius' interpretation of sexes. The fact is that, even in the original, there are several lines that were attributed\ndirectly to the Mother. In terms of the way that we look at the world and they way in which this works, it does not really matter, in that sense. Within the 18 th gate, we will always have that challenge to authority,\nwhether it is male or female.\n\nThe potential to correct through gradual modifications of judgments. It is like the way you feel about a parent when you are growing up with them and what you feel about them when you become a parent\nyourself. This is the nature of the first line, a totally different process. This is the gradual modification of judgments but, basically, very conservative. In the Confucius sense of the word, that conservative\nauthority was always the father figure. This is what you get on the other side. You have to recognize about this line that, in a woman, it operates through what is yang in her. In other words, it is not really\nabout the father and the mother but it is the male and the female. Le., it is the yang in the mother that can be operating here.\n\nThe potential to refuse to correct. \"My mother was always right,\" or \"My father is always right.\" It can be deeply conservative in that sense. It is trying to set the basis. The basis is that if the authority does not\nhave to be corrected, then you have a pattern you can trust. That is what the logic is looking for. It is\n\nPage 1\n\nlooking for a perfect pattern. A perfect pattern does not need any correction and, therefore, we can safely project into the future out of that pattern.\n\nThe person on the detriment side says, \"My father's father was right, so I am right.\" This movement is going through there and, because of that, you can say, \"You listen to me because he was right with me\nand I am right with you,\" to establish that authority.\n\nThe potential to correct gradually. \"Maybe my father was not always right.\" What happens in the first line is that, because it is setting the foundation, if it is deeply disturbed in the first line, the whole thing falls\napart. This is all about correcting and challenging authority. First line people are very introspective and look into the nature of that and say, \"Basically, they were right,\" or \"We have to bring about some slow\ngradual change in that.\"\n\n18.2 Terminal disease\n\nWith the second line, we come to projection and we have already seen that there is no sense of the nature of the gate itself. There is simply the need to project, the need for correction outwards. That is why it is\nthe classic line of the bitch. The moment we have projection without any detail, we get all kinds of confrontations and problems that come out of that.\n\nTerminal disease. The recognition that what has been spoilt is irreversible. There is no way to correct it.\n\nPluto exalted: Acceptance and strength derived from a faith in spiritual regeneration. In other words, leave all that business about correcting it and see if you can find your own inner quality. Forget\nabout the authority that you are so annoyed with.\n\nIn the white book: The acceptance that there is no potential for correction. Not everything needs to be corrected and, by the way, that does not have to be bad. In other words, you can just see there is no way to\ncorrect it, so all right. This thing cannot be corrected, so you deal with other things that can be corrected.\n\nThe other side of this, the Moon in detriment: The futile raging against the wind. \"This father and mother of mine are horrible and I want to change them. They have to change but they do not listen to me.\nI keep on telling them that they have to change.\" It does not work. It is just this endless projecting outwards. That becomes an illness in and of itself; we are dealing with the splenic system, after all. The\nraging against the wind builds up all kinds of tensions within the body.\n\nOn the other side, in the detriment we have: The refusal to accept that there is no potential of correction.\nThey are the people that can drive you crazy because they will not let go of it. They just keep on projecting because all second lines are limited in their ability to understand the other side. They do not\nknow what it takes to deal with the other side and what the circumstances of the other side are.\n\nIf somebody walks strangely due to a deformity and you want to correct that in them, he/she may have no way of changing that. You can scream at them all the time but this will not do any good. There is a point\nin which this can become enormously painful for anybody who has to deal with it and these people will turn it on themselves. The 18th gate is notorious for taking itself seriously and getting very personal about\nthe nature of what their correction is supposed to be. They can become obsessed: \"I refuse. It has to be corrected. He has to fix it. The whole world must stop smoking.\"\n\n18.3 The Zealot\n\nPage 2\n\nWe know that the third line has the quality of having the introspective background in it and that it has the gift to project that outwards. It recognizes that there is something on the other side of the channel and it\nfigures out a way to deal with or to adapt to that. The third line is in the emotional wave of bonds made and broken, and when you bring the two elements together, it can be irresponsible; it can get involved in a\ncorrection and then suddenly quit. That is also a part of it.\n\nIn the third line we have The Zealot. The energetic obsession to clean house. These are very good house cleaners.\n\nNeptune exalted. The dissolution of old forms at an acceptable price. The third gate wants to correct.\nIt is equipped. It has its detail, its introspection and its projecting capability. It wants to correct. It is obsessed with correction. After all, this is what the gate is all about. If I cannot correct anything else, I\nwill sweep the floor and make sure that everything is nice and clean. The willingness is there, no matter what the correction is about.\n\nIn the white book: An obsession with correction and its critical potential. Please recognize that, no matter how difficult it sounds, our collective would be lost without this because it would have no basis for our\ntalents. There is no logic talent without this critical capacity, the perfecting capacity, this need to correct, this need to challenge the authority. Everybody would still write music in its original form. Everybody\nwould dance the way we first danced. Nothing would have grown without this correcting capacity.\nNobody would have said, \"I judge that to be lousy. Let me show you what is good.\"\n\nJupiter in detriment: Rigid jugdmentation that creates as many problems as it solves. \"I know that this has to be corrected, whether you like it or not.\" The 'you' on the other end has to provide the energy\nfor correction. If you are the 18 and you do not have the vital energy of the 58, all you can do is complain.\nYou don't have the capacity to do anything about it because you are not being energized.\n\nAn obsession with correction that does not bring satisfaction. What happens to the people at the detriment level is that they have all this correcting energy and they may get a chance to correct something, but it\ndoes not take away this \"whatever\" inside of them that two seconds later says, \"Yes, and...? The thing we just corrected needs further corrections. Let's correct it more.\" Adolf Hitler had the detriment of this line.\n\n18.4 The Incompetent\n\nWhen we get to the fourth line, we get to the beginning of the upper trigram. This line is called \"The\nIncompetent\". The nature of fourth lines is to externalize, which means that these lines are very fixed on a specific aspect. In some way, this is very reminiscent of the way in which the second line works.\nDifficulties as a result of inadequacies that cannot be resolved because of inadequacies. What this generally means for these people is that they will have a specific thing they want to correct. There are all\nkinds of other things they are able to correct in their life, but the one thing that they really want to correct, they can't because they are inadequate to do that. By the way, the moment that they meet somebody that\nhas the 48 and they get into contact with The Well, this can relieve inadequacy. The fear of inadequacy is in the 48th gate, which is the next step in this stream.\n\nRemember that we are looking at gates that are potentials in a four gate stream. Here we have the potential of this awareness. The thing to recognize is that the awareness alone, this one thing that they\ncannot correct because of inadequacy, can come into contact with the necessary depth. That is always possible. All lines can ultimately be the exact mirrors of what they say.\n\nEarth exalted: Given this negative position, survival through suffering. The inability to correct and its potential for suffering. These are people that say, \"I just cannot make it better,\" and they really suffer.\n\nPage 3\n\n\"I can't fix it. I can't correct it. I can't come up with a solution to this problem. I can't do anything about it.\"\n\nMercury in detriment. Indecision and anxiety and no escape from misfortune. The demands of correction and its potential to generate anxiety. This constant anxiety comes from having this one thing\nthat you can't correct. When you see this line, be very careful about that. Don't see that as meaning that they are incompetent with everything. That is not true. So often, when people see this line, they think that\nit is saying that they are incompetent to correct their general process. This is not true. Everything about the fourth line is about being fixed. You have to ask these people, \"What is this one thing that you want to\nfix, that you can't?\" and see that isolated from the rest which you can work with.\n\nThe inability to correct and its potential for suffering; or The demands of correction and its potential to generate anxiety. One can become very anxious if there is this one thing that one cannot fix. This is the\ndifficulty of the fourth line.\n\nThe fourth line can recognize incompetence everywhere because they know what it is like for them. This is true for every line that you read and think, \"Oh, my god, these poor people.\" The lines have their\npositive and negative and every line is a duality. These are processes that we go through. And whatever line you have, it is yours. Enjoy it.\n\n18.5 Therapy\n\nThe fifth line is called Therapy. It is a very important line. After all, we have a collective process here and the fifth line is the universalization line. Thus we have a universalized collective process here. It is the\nultimate of what this hexagram is all about. The interesting thing about this is that when you look at what this line says, you realize that what correction represents is that it can be of enormous value or it can\nmake you very ill. That is what it is saying.\n\nThe strength to recognize a problem and to accept that it is beyond one 's power to solve it alone. This is a collective sharing process. This is the only place where the word 'therapy' exists. So, this has a lot to do\nwith what we call therapeutic sciences or work that is done in our society.\n\nSaturn exalted. The wisdom to both seek and provide guidance. The potential for correction and judgment through relationships. This is the universalization of correction. It is about correcting the other.\nThe fifth line knows that, apart from the gate, there is a stream and a circuit and it wants to correct others and needs correction as well. That is part of its process. That correction is rooted in relationships.\n\nThe Uranian side: The mental patient. Chronic instability and potential madness. Where would the therapist be without their crazy patient? And they both have the same line. Think about that, folks. That is\nvery funny. The therapist and the crazy patient are the same. I have seldom met a therapist who was saner than their patients. It simply does not work. They are simply, subjectively, relatively nuts in different\nways. They are exactly the same and mirrors of each other, and that mirror is here in Therapy.\n\nWhere relationships cannot assist in correcting the potential of mental instability. The need on one side to correct the unstable and the need of the unstable to be corrected by the other: this is all built within this\nfifth line.\n\nThe nature of this hexagram, in the end, is all about the protection of fundamental human rights: to find a common ground in which it is possible for us to have a secure pattern which we can live in the future so\nthat we can evolve safely. This is all about finding the solution. Here you have somebody who is always\n\nPage 4\n\nready to correct the other. They are not ready to correct themselves. In the detriment, you have the other that is waiting for them to come and correct them. They all belong in the same bag.\n\n18.6 Buddhahood\n\nWhen you get to the sixth line, you get to the top of the house. You get to the roof. This line is called\nBuddhahood. It says: The perfected form. These people assume that everything is correct, whether it is or not.\n\nMars exalted. The Buddha state of the eternal child and the energy to find new horizons to avoid stasis.\n\"Everything is correct. Everything is great. What else is going to happen in this life? Where are we going?\nWhat is in the future for us?\"\n\nMoon in detriment. The mundane application of the above. The ability to tap public opinion and share methodology. \"Let me tell you why my life is perfect.\" That is the nature of Buddhahood.\n\nThe potential of the perfected form through correction. Nothing needs to be corrected. Everything is okay.\nThe other side of this is: The potential to share the values of the correction with others. \"Let me tell you why.\"\n\nBy the way, if you have this in your design, whether you are male or female, you need somebody who is much more mature than you, who is older than you as a lover. This is really about the child in its\nrelationship to authority. It is very much, in a sense, the young child's way of looking at life. Everything is correct and okay. If you ask them why they feel so good, they will tell you that the grass grows green.\nThey will share their methodology with you. They are not interested in this corrective process. What they really want is to be spoilt. This is not work on what has been spoilt. This is: please spoil me. Buy me nice\npresents. Take me out to dinner. Treat me like a child. Give me my bath. They get what they want out of everybody. If you look at the fuel at the other side, it is called Getting carried away. It can be very nice\nexcept that you have to serve them all the time.\n\nPage 5",

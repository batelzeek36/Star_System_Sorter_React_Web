Egoists make their living on what they can do. They make that living based on what they show\nthey can and have done. The moment that the egoist goes out for the company and makes a sale, they can skate for weeks doing nothing, just floating along, feeling wonderful and living off that moment of\naccomplishment. \"Did you see what I did? I did that. At any moment I could do it again, if I am in the mood. Treat me nice. Give me a good bonus. Allow me to go to the golf course.\" Meanwhile, everybody\nin the factory is sweating.\n\nEgos have a bad reputation for a reason. There are a lot of people dependent on the ego making the sale.\nIf they do not make the sale, the people in the factory cannot make their living, the stockholders do not make any money, the boss gets fired.

This is one thing that is so wonderful about manipulation of memory.

I work one day.\" What I tell 26's is that it is so important in their working life that they make sure they have enough\nleisure time because leisure time, vacations, are essential in order for them to be able to recuperate their energy.\n\nI know this so intensely in my personal life. I had Pluto defining my sacral center for seven years. It is gone now and I am back to being ruled by my ego and I know what that feels like. It is very different.

Now I can escape for a\nwhile.\" That is what the ego does, so it can dream. The ego loves to dream. Let it accept what it has and let it go off dreaming about what is possible because it is the dream that sells.\n\nThat is the gift of the 26 which it transmits to the tribe and, by doing so, it is able to bring the tribe the nourishment that it needs. That is the foundation. They are not very good at being handled. I am a 26.1, so\nwhenever I would stop doing educational work when I was younger and got into business, it was always very clear to me that there was always somebody trying to put a finger on my time and my energy and my\nwill.

      "raw": "Page 2\n\nWhen you come to the second line, you come to the situation where you can be seen. The 26 is not just the egoist, it is also the capacity to lie and to exaggerate: all of these things that are part of what is\nnecessary to get information to the tribe. People look inside of the 26.2 and they see them as being either egoists or liars. These people are always being watched and they don't necessarily know that because\nsecond lines do not have that kind of capacity. What they say, whether it is an exaggeration or not, can be seen by others and, all of a sudden, they are paper tigers and suddenly meet somebody who says, \"You\nsaid that.\"\n\nThe lessons of history. The energy and depth of reflection to learn from the past in anticipation of the future. They learn that if you lie, then you'd better have a very good memory because, otherwise, you will\nget caught. 'Oh, entangled webs we weave, would first we practiced to deceive.' You will have to have a good memory. This is what they learn. They don't think anybody is listening to them. \"I have caught this\nhuge fish last night. It was an incredible thing. \" The next day, their partner asks and it turns out that it was not true and they don't even remember because they do not think that anybody has actually listened to all\nthat. But they are listened to because they can be seen as being an exaggerator, or being an egoist.\n\nPluto in detriment. The urge to take action despite the evidence of history. To try to continue with your manipulation even when you have been found out. The whole thing about second lines is: they get found\nout. That is not bad because if they get found out enough, they can end up being the best liars and, by the way, being a liar is not bad. It depends on what you are lying about. By telling somebody, \"This is the\nbest refrigerator that has ever been made,\" yes, it is a lie, but the., person who is buying that does not want to hear, \"This is the worst one ever made.\" Then you would not buy it. You don't want to hear, \"This\nis all right. It is okay.. It works.\" You don't want to hear that either. You want to hear somebody saying to' you,, \"I know that you are surprised) that it is only 1/1 Oth the priicef of a good refrigerator, but this is the\nbest one ever. You will save a lot of money and be happy. Besides that, your mother and your neighbor bought one, so you must buy one too.\"\n\nThis kind of lie is something that is very productive in ourcommunities because that is-what we expect, like on TV: \"This product gets everything whiter than anythimg else.\" The tribe loves that. We all know\nthat it is a joke.. But we! don't want to be told, \"This is a so-so cleaner.\" \\4 want to be told that it is. the best cleaner. The second) line gets found out but they discover that people are paying attention to them. In\ndiscovering that; they have to be careful.\n\nOne of the things that 26's and 4N have to deal with in their life is the expectation of everybody else who is.dependemt on their ego.. So they put their ego and their willpower to the test every time, like the athlete\nthat is pumped up one the! field: if the 40 makes a bad move, everybody is going to. boo them. They have to take the burden of:everybody else's expectation. With the 26, everybody else has an expectation that\nyou are the only one that can sell the product. They are all depending on you. You have to take the burden of that as well. The fact of the matter is that 26's seek out a way to get out of the pressure so that they can\nrecuperate their energy because the ego cannot work consistently, and then they go back in. In that space in between this is where all the lying takes place. It is not just lying; it is sometimes nothing more than\nexaggeration.\n\nThis whole business about stretching whatever the truth happens to be: the 26 and the 40 will do that in order to protect their time, their energy and their ego from being shattered. When the 26 says, \"This is the\nbest refrigerator, please buy it,\" one out of every fourteen people will say \"yes.\" Thirteen say \"no.\" That\n26 has to deal with all of these no's. It is not so easy for that 26 to go back out into the world the next time because they know that, in order to get to the place where everybody thinks they are so wonderful, they\nhave to go through a space where everybody thinks that they are terrible (the people who say, \"Go away. I don't need this.\") This is quite a role. The 26's are suppliers for the community.\n\nPage 3\n\nSomeone who is just operating out of an undefined ego that gets pumped up by somebody else, blurts these things out and has no idea. Somebody with an ego not connected to an awareness system within\nthem has no idea and no way of reflecting upon it. Yes, they can get very much caught up in the exaggeration itself and live it out.\n\nOf course, all the lower trigrams here get shocked anyway because the lower trigram will always meet the outside when it is least expected. So the 26.2 who does not think anybody is paying attention to it is on\nthe golf course and suddenly meets the boss. The boss says \"I thought you were with Mr. Jones.\" It is this moment where they get found out. This happens to them. \"Mr. Jones died.\"\n\nI have trained sales people and they all lie, otherwise they could not do their job. They have to lie to themselves, too, just to give themselves the courage to go back out into the world and to deal with people\nthat reject them. After all, we expect of the ego what no other center is expected to deal with. The ego is expected to deal with abuse, rejection. The jobs that no other center wants, they give to the ego. The ego\nwill protect itself. It is unaware, so it uses the tools that are inherent to it.",

      "raw": "The upper trigram gives us a transpersonal, manipulative skill. In other words, when you deal with the fourth and fifth lines in the 26, you are dealing with people who really do have a deep skill in them to\ntransmit to the tribe, to be able to propagandize or market or take to the tribe.\n\nMy nickname for the fourth line of Censorship is 'the Chernobyl line.' It is a very funny line. Listen to what it says: The alteration of memory through elimination. It is an overview line which means that it\ntakes time in life. The memory system, what you remember, is changed by slowly removing things. It is like, by the time you actually give your resume to somebody that you want a job from, you have left out\nthe jobs you don't want them to know about. This is the elimination of memory that comes over time.\n\nPluto exalted. The ability through censorship to save the collectivity from itself. In other words, you have somebody in a hospital in Hamburg and the doctors think that it is, possibly the Ebola virus. If that were\nactually true,, it would create an enormous dilemma within the community.. So when the doctor says, \"Until I am really sure, I am mot going to. tell) anybody. I am going to save! the collectivity from itself,,\nfrom its panic.\" That is one side. That is the positive side.\n\nWhen you get to the Saturn in detriment (Chernobyl): The use of censorship to maintain the status quo; selective memory in fear of unrestrained consequences. \"No, there was no accident in the nuclear pliant,,\nas far as we know everything is, time.\" This is not letting out the information, out of: fear of what will happen if that information gets out.\n\nI am using large examples, of this. In a human being, what that means is that, on the exalted side, there are things that are left behind that should be left behind because it is; healthier.. In the detriment, things\nare left behind that may not make! yaw healthier because they are left behind, but regardless, these are not people that should ever have post life therapy, they should not have hypnotism or rebirthing sessions..\nThey should not go through any of these things because what is left behind, what is forgotten, is important to leave forgotten far these people.\n\nIn the white book: The power of the ego maintained through forgetting. Take the example of a salesperson. If you have to do a sales job and the last sales job you had, you were a failure and you were\nfired and you could not make your living, it is a good idea not to remember how bad all that was. It is a good idea just to put that aside and just see what will happen in the next job.

It is a very funny line. Listen to what it says: The alteration of memory through elimination. It is an overview line which means that it\ntakes time in life. The memory system, what you remember, is changed by slowly removing things.

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 26 THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT\n\nWe go from the small will (the 40) to the small ego. The small willpower in the 40 leads into the big willpower in the 51 and the small ego in the 26 crosses over to the 21, the big ego. Here we deal with the\nsmall ego. In sexual terminology, both the 40 and the 26 are gates of denial. They are fundamentally weak. That is why they need their rest.\n\nThink about the 26. We know that the instinctive side of tribal circuitry has to do with our organizational groupings on the material plane, our work culture. The 26th gate is the gate of the marketing manager or\nthe sales person. One of the things that are so clear about the 26 is that while everybody else in the factory is working really hard and struggling to get the products out on time, on a deadline, administrating the\norganization and keeping the company happy, the 26 is on the golf course. It is playing golf and not doing its business.\n\nPlease recognize that the ego cannot work the way in which everybody else who needs the ego wants it to work. Everybody wants the ego to be like the root center or the sacral center, but it is not. It is very\ndifferent.\n\nI have told students of mine before, in the Gray courses, that one of the cute little mysteries of our design is that there is no direct connection between the ego and the sacral center. It there was one, we would not\ndie. It is because the sacral center, with a direct connection to the ego, will stop the ego from being lazy and going to sleep. It just will.\n\nThe moment the sacral has a direct connection to the ego, the ego would not be allowed to say, \"I am a motor but I am not working today.\" Only the ego can do that because that is the kind of motor that the ego\nis. The difficulty that society has with the ego is the assumption that willpower has to operate like sacral power. It is not true. This is not a generator at all.\n\nWritten above the lines it says: The maximization of the power of memory applied to the nurturing of continuity. The 26th gate is the gate of the egoist and it is the gate of exaggeration. The tribe expects to be\nexaggerated to. It is very important for the tribe. It likes that. This is the best refrigerator, the best car, the best country. Exaggeration is part of the way of getting the tribe to feel good. The 26th gate is the strength\nor lack of strength to apply memory.\n\nThe whole thing to understand about the ego is that it is built on manipulation, and please do not think of this as a bad word. It is simply the ability to manipulate things. There are very few gates that are called\n'taming gates': The Taming Power of the Small (the 9th gate), to be able to take the broad spectrum of energy and to focus, tame it, to tame the root and its pressure by focusing it; and here, the capacity of the\nego to manipulate instinctive memory.\n\nBecause it is a small ego, it also must be massaged and, while everybody else is working so hard, the boss calls the salesman who is standing on the golf course with his cell phone. The boss asks, \"Did you see the\nclient?' Hoh, yes,\" says the 26. \"Of course I did.\" That may or may not be true. The 26 may want to see that client, may think that they should see that client, but this is the ego and rest is important.\n\n\"I really don't have the juice,\" says the 26. Only when the ego is understood for that nature can it be properly handled by 37's, 44's, 25's, or 45's. Until that is understood, there is only conflict with the ego.\n\n26.1 A Bird in the hand\n\nPage 1\n\nThe first line establishes the foundation of what the hexagram is all about. Here we find A bird in the hand. The saying in English is, \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\" In other words, it is really\ngood to recognize what you have rather than trying to imagine what you could possibly get. This is one of the great lessons for the egoist.\n\nNeptune exalted. Whenever you see Neptune exalted in a first line you are allowed to shake your head and wonder. This is a foundation line and Neptune does not allow you to see anything. So the egoist never\nreally gets into the foundation. They just sort of get confused about what it is to be them.\n\nThe ability to enjoy the dreams engendered by accomplishment in order to avoid delusion of unlikely potential. Egoists make their living on what they can do. They make that living based on what they show\nthey can and have done. The moment that the egoist goes out for the company and makes a sale, they can skate for weeks doing nothing, just floating along, feeling wonderful and living off that moment of\naccomplishment. \"Did you see what I did? I did that. At any moment I could do it again, if I am in the mood. Treat me nice. Give me a good bonus. Allow me to go to the golf course.\" Meanwhile, everybody\nin the factory is sweating.\n\nEgos have a bad reputation for a reason. There are a lot of people dependent on the ego making the sale.\nIf they do not make the sale, the people in the factory cannot make their living, the stockholders do not make any money, the boss gets fired. They are all sitting there waiting for the ego that is on the golf\ncourse.\n\nMars in detriment. Accomplishment as a license for foolhardy risk taking. \"I made that sale. Ain't I great?\nI will quit and see if I will get a better job,\" or \"I should really be the boss of this company.\"\n\nThe ego which transcends limitation through dreaming. This is one thing that is so wonderful about manipulation of memory. The 26 dreams of being a 21 because the 21 seems to be in control of\neverything and the 26 would love to be in control. \"I am on the golf course four days a week. I work one day.\" What I tell 26's is that it is so important in their working life that they make sure they have enough\nleisure time because leisure time, vacations, are essential in order for them to be able to recuperate their energy.\n\nI know this so intensely in my personal life. I had Pluto defining my sacral center for seven years. It is gone now and I am back to being ruled by my ego and I know what that feels like. It is very different. The\nsacral pumps out the energy over and over. It is the ego that says, \"Should I really do that? Maybe I'll just rest today. I have been able to achieve this and that. I don't have to do anything. Now I can escape for a\nwhile.\" That is what the ego does, so it can dream. The ego loves to dream. Let it accept what it has and let it go off dreaming about what is possible because it is the dream that sells.\n\nThat is the gift of the 26 which it transmits to the tribe and, by doing so, it is able to bring the tribe the nourishment that it needs. That is the foundation. They are not very good at being handled. I am a 26.1, so\nwhenever I would stop doing educational work when I was younger and got into business, it was always very clear to me that there was always somebody trying to put a finger on my time and my energy and my\nwill. I am not very good at being handled.\n\n44's do the handling for the 26's. If the 44 does not know how to handle a 26, enormous problems will come into the organization. They simply do not function properly anymore. So this is interesting to\nrecognize: you are dealing with a lower trigram and their commitment to society. It is a gate of denial. \"I don't care about the people in the factory. I'll play golf today.\" This is not transpersonal.\n\n26.2 The Lessons of History\n\nPage 2\n\nWhen you come to the second line, you come to the situation where you can be seen. The 26 is not just the egoist, it is also the capacity to lie and to exaggerate: all of these things that are part of what is\nnecessary to get information to the tribe. People look inside of the 26.2 and they see them as being either egoists or liars. These people are always being watched and they don't necessarily know that because\nsecond lines do not have that kind of capacity. What they say, whether it is an exaggeration or not, can be seen by others and, all of a sudden, they are paper tigers and suddenly meet somebody who says, \"You\nsaid that.\"\n\nThe lessons of history. The energy and depth of reflection to learn from the past in anticipation of the future. They learn that if you lie, then you'd better have a very good memory because, otherwise, you will\nget caught. 'Oh, entangled webs we weave, would first we practiced to deceive.' You will have to have a good memory. This is what they learn. They don't think anybody is listening to them. \"I have caught this\nhuge fish last night. It was an incredible thing. \" The next day, their partner asks and it turns out that it was not true and they don't even remember because they do not think that anybody has actually listened to all\nthat. But they are listened to because they can be seen as being an exaggerator, or being an egoist.\n\nPluto in detriment. The urge to take action despite the evidence of history. To try to continue with your manipulation even when you have been found out. The whole thing about second lines is: they get found\nout. That is not bad because if they get found out enough, they can end up being the best liars and, by the way, being a liar is not bad. It depends on what you are lying about. By telling somebody, \"This is the\nbest refrigerator that has ever been made,\" yes, it is a lie, but the., person who is buying that does not want to hear, \"This is the worst one ever made.\" Then you would not buy it. You don't want to hear, \"This\nis all right. It is okay.. It works.\" You don't want to hear that either. You want to hear somebody saying to' you,, \"I know that you are surprised) that it is only 1/1 Oth the priicef of a good refrigerator, but this is the\nbest one ever. You will save a lot of money and be happy. Besides that, your mother and your neighbor bought one, so you must buy one too.\"\n\nThis kind of lie is something that is very productive in ourcommunities because that is-what we expect, like on TV: \"This product gets everything whiter than anythimg else.\" The tribe loves that. We all know\nthat it is a joke.. But we! don't want to be told, \"This is a so-so cleaner.\" \\4 want to be told that it is. the best cleaner. The second) line gets found out but they discover that people are paying attention to them. In\ndiscovering that; they have to be careful.\n\nOne of the things that 26's and 4N have to deal with in their life is the expectation of everybody else who is.dependemt on their ego.. So they put their ego and their willpower to the test every time, like the athlete\nthat is pumped up one the! field: if the 40 makes a bad move, everybody is going to. boo them. They have to take the burden of:everybody else's expectation. With the 26, everybody else has an expectation that\nyou are the only one that can sell the product. They are all depending on you. You have to take the burden of that as well. The fact of the matter is that 26's seek out a way to get out of the pressure so that they can\nrecuperate their energy because the ego cannot work consistently, and then they go back in. In that space in between this is where all the lying takes place. It is not just lying; it is sometimes nothing more than\nexaggeration.\n\nThis whole business about stretching whatever the truth happens to be: the 26 and the 40 will do that in order to protect their time, their energy and their ego from being shattered. When the 26 says, \"This is the\nbest refrigerator, please buy it,\" one out of every fourteen people will say \"yes.\" Thirteen say \"no.\" That\n26 has to deal with all of these no's. It is not so easy for that 26 to go back out into the world the next time because they know that, in order to get to the place where everybody thinks they are so wonderful, they\nhave to go through a space where everybody thinks that they are terrible (the people who say, \"Go away. I don't need this.\") This is quite a role. The 26's are suppliers for the community.\n\nPage 3\n\nSomeone who is just operating out of an undefined ego that gets pumped up by somebody else, blurts these things out and has no idea. Somebody with an ego not connected to an awareness system within\nthem has no idea and no way of reflecting upon it. Yes, they can get very much caught up in the exaggeration itself and live it out.\n\nOf course, all the lower trigrams here get shocked anyway because the lower trigram will always meet the outside when it is least expected. So the 26.2 who does not think anybody is paying attention to it is on\nthe golf course and suddenly meets the boss. The boss says \"I thought you were with Mr. Jones.\" It is this moment where they get found out. This happens to them. \"Mr. Jones died.\"\n\nI have trained sales people and they all lie, otherwise they could not do their job. They have to lie to themselves, too, just to give themselves the courage to go back out into the world and to deal with people\nthat reject them. After all, we expect of the ego what no other center is expected to deal with. The ego is expected to deal with abuse, rejection. The jobs that no other center wants, they give to the ego. The ego\nwill protect itself. It is unaware, so it uses the tools that are inherent to it.\n\n26.3 Influence\n\nThis third line is an overview line like the 40.3. It is telling you that through trial and error, through adaptation, you have a lifelong process. The ability, once prepared, to gather support. 'Once prepared': it\nis a long-term process. These people really have a gift. Third lines are always the harmony to wisdom in the sixth line. The third line can develop through trial and error the kind of techniques that will allow it to\nmanipulate memory, so that they can successfully serve the community.\n\nThe Sun exalted. The authority to focus communal effort. They have to learn this. Remember something about the 26. The vast majority of the time, because the ego is unaware, this capacity to exaggerate, to\ntransmit to the community, to enlarge things in order to make them attractive, can become what we call lying. But, at the same time, the 26 is capable of great truth, like all tricksters. They can tell you as great a\ntruth as they can tell you a great lie because this is what is inherent in their capacity.\n\nThe Saturn in detriment. There is nothing more to the point than a salesman that walks into the office and quits, saying, \"I'll tell you why nobody can sell this product.\" They will tell you the truth and they will put\nit to you so clear that you cannot miss it. You can close down the factory and do something else.\n\nThe leadership, while gathering support, will underestimate potential challenges. This is one of things about the ego: The ego gets carried away and it is vulnerable. It either does too much or it ignores the\ndemands and threats that can come to it from others. Whenever you see terminology like 'threat' here, basically all this is talking about is demands that are made on this gate. The ego is always faced with\ndemands being made on it, either the demands within itself (it depends on the design) or, most often, the demands that are coming from the outside.\n\nIn the white book: The power of the ego to gather support. It takes time for that ego to develop that strength and only when it develops that strength can it gather support. Understand something about the\nego: it is at its strongest when it can accept rejection. This is the only time that the ego is truly strong. No ego is strong that suffers from rejection. It is not possible. If you go out into the world and you are trying\nto get others to be interested in something, the ratio of those who will actually be positive with you is very small. Rejection is something that is inherent for the ego to learn about. It is why the ego likes to be left\nalone a lot, because when it goes out there into the world, it will have to deal with that quality of life that always brings rejection into its life. The ego is unable to recognize the challenges or the potential in\nothers, or the potential challenges in others, certain demands on the ego.\n\nPage 4\n\nThe whole thing about this third line is that you can learn through trial and error how to use your ego to influence the collective, but the moment that somebody sees that you have that gift, they want you to do\nthat for them as well. Not only that but once they figure out what you are doing, they want to take it from you. Egos are always being challenged by competition. Always. Otherwise we would not have a patent\noffice.\n\n26.4 Censorship\n\nThe upper trigram gives us a transpersonal, manipulative skill. In other words, when you deal with the fourth and fifth lines in the 26, you are dealing with people who really do have a deep skill in them to\ntransmit to the tribe, to be able to propagandize or market or take to the tribe.\n\nMy nickname for the fourth line of Censorship is 'the Chernobyl line.' It is a very funny line. Listen to what it says: The alteration of memory through elimination. It is an overview line which means that it\ntakes time in life. The memory system, what you remember, is changed by slowly removing things. It is like, by the time you actually give your resume to somebody that you want a job from, you have left out\nthe jobs you don't want them to know about. This is the elimination of memory that comes over time.\n\nPluto exalted. The ability through censorship to save the collectivity from itself. In other words, you have somebody in a hospital in Hamburg and the doctors think that it is, possibly the Ebola virus. If that were\nactually true,, it would create an enormous dilemma within the community.. So when the doctor says, \"Until I am really sure, I am mot going to. tell) anybody. I am going to save! the collectivity from itself,,\nfrom its panic.\" That is one side. That is the positive side.\n\nWhen you get to the Saturn in detriment (Chernobyl): The use of censorship to maintain the status quo; selective memory in fear of unrestrained consequences. \"No, there was no accident in the nuclear pliant,,\nas far as we know everything is, time.\" This is not letting out the information, out of: fear of what will happen if that information gets out.\n\nI am using large examples, of this. In a human being, what that means is that, on the exalted side, there are things that are left behind that should be left behind because it is; healthier.. In the detriment, things\nare left behind that may not make! yaw healthier because they are left behind, but regardless, these are not people that should ever have post life therapy, they should not have hypnotism or rebirthing sessions..\nThey should not go through any of these things because what is left behind, what is forgotten, is important to leave forgotten far these people.\n\nIn the white book: The power of the ego maintained through forgetting. Take the example of a salesperson. If you have to do a sales job and the last sales job you had, you were a failure and you were\nfired and you could not make your living, it is a good idea not to remember how bad all that was. It is a good idea just to put that aside and just see what will happen in the next job. In other words, for the\nstrength of the ego, for these people, it is important that certain things are forgotten.\n\nThe other side of this: The power of the ego maintained through selective memory. It is the selective memory that can be detrimental. These people forget things, i.e. they forget to tell you that there was a\nphone call because, in their imagination, that call might be disruptive for you and they don't want to be the source of that disruption. So they just selectively forget to tell you that there was this phone call from\nyour banker, the police, or the doctor. In other words, this censorship works at many different levels. For the 26.4 person it is healthy to forget, but it is unhealthy for the others. Someone with the 26.4 makes you\nuncomfortable because you know that there is something they are not telling you. That is when the 44 comes along and pulls it out, just like the 37 can pull it out of the 40.\n\nPage 5\n\n26.5 Adaptability\n\nWhat is often misunderstood about the 26 and the 40 is that they are enormously involved with other human beings. These are deep human-contact gates because the tribe is dependent on the ego. So these\ngates, because they are the only way for the tribe to get into that ego system, have to deal with all kinds of human and social pressures. Whenever I see someone who has the 26.5, I always say to them: \"You\nknow, you are made for Human Design.\"\n\nIf there is a line of all the 384 lines that says that you should study Human Design, it is the fifth line of\nAdaptability. This is what the outside projects onto this capacity of the egoist. Here in this projection we have: The understanding of mechanics and the application of energy to achieve maximum potential. If\nyou don't understand human beings, if you don't understand how things work, then you are not going to be able to properly manipulate the information and get it out. You have to know how people work.\n\nI had a job once where I had to make two hundred phone calls a day. It was in a newspaper office and I was in my early twenties. I had an old Dutch boss and he had made millions of dollars doing this job. He\nwas training me because he intended to retire. He told me, \"If you make two hundred calls a day, you are going to get twenty that say yes.\" By the way, if you make two hundred phone calls a day and you are the\nworld's best salesperson, twenty will say \"yes.\" The capacity is about being able to accept those one hundred eighty \"no's\". I have had so many phones slammed down on me, so many people say, \"No, don't\nbother me.\" I did that for two years in my life. I probably spoke to half a million of people. I probably had four hundred ninety thousands of, \"Go away, no.\" I made a lot of money. This is what the ego is all about:\nto understand the nature of human beings. When I pick up the telephone and I hear somebody's voice, I can tell you so much just when I hear their voice.\n\nEverything about the capacity to have influence on the tribe is the ability to understand the nature of human beings, how they work and what they need and how to satisfy those needs, how to explain to\nsomebody what they need and that you can do it for them.\n\nVenus in detriment. A resistance and dissatisfaction when basic changes to nature are necessary. This is all about being forced to learn techniques. Remember that the fifth line gets projected on. Everybody\nsays, \"You can be great at this,\" but that does not mean that you have the tools that it takes. The tools that it takes are, that the moment that you step in there, you really have to understand other human beings.\n\nIn the white book: The power of memory which maximizes the potential of the ego to attract others; and\nThe resistance of the egoist to adaptation. The moment that these people that have to learn techniques have to change their technique, they are very uncomfortable. So the 26.5 in detriment, when they have to\nlearn a new way of dealing with people or of doing their work, they are very uncomfortable; they really do not want to have to adapt to that. Understand mechanics.\n\n26.6 Authority\n\nThe whole thing to recognize about the nature of the sixth line that is sitting on the roof is to look at what they meet in their next step, which is the 11.1 in this case. It is the gate of ideas and the first line is called\nAttunement. That first line of attunement is about the concept of being in the right place at the right time.\nOne of the most frustrating things for the 26.6 is that it is trying to figure out exactly the right time and place because everything about the 26.6 is the recognition that the ego only gets respect through its\ncorrectness of action, only then can it truly be an authority. Here we have an overview line. It is a lifelong process.\n\nPage 6\n\nAuthority The natural attainment of influence justified by the correctness of actions. What this represents is the legitimate ego. I have no problem with my ego in terms of being able to see that I have some kind\nof accomplishment in my life. The ego tends to be justified. This is all about the value of the ego as a motor, justified by the correctness of his action, that the ego in this doing is correct. If it works to the\nbenefit of the community, to the material benefit of the 26, if it is correct, if they are in the right place at the right time, this is perfect.\n\nWell, you don't get it all the time. The 26.6, after trying when they are young to assert their ego and control others, they give up and they go and sit on the cosmic fence and they watch the movie, waiting for\nthat possibility that perhaps there is a right place and that there is a right time to fulfill the potential of the tribe.\n\nThe Sun exalted. The embodiment of reason and purpose that posses the test of time. This means that the ego has to be consistent; what it produces has to be of value. In the end, the ego is there to make sure that\nthe tribe is healthy, that the tribe has enough to eat, that the tribe has shelter and all the other things that are part of the ego's responsibility in the tribal structure.\n\nThe Moon in detriment attains Authority as a symbol and focus but not necessarily as a true embodiment.\nThe constitutional monarch, stripped of real power but still the symbol of continuity of authority. These people are always separate and they can be very inspiring, ego-wise, yet they themselves don't do\nanything. They are still waiting for their opportunity to really be in the right place at the right time.\nAlways remember in any kind of reading: when you come to a sixth line, don't expect it to act like the hexagram. It will do so when it is young because it has to learn, but it will not do so later. It will hold\nback. A sixth line sees the whole circuit. This 26.6 is looking at the whole tribal circuit which says: \"I have to serve and protect the people.\" So, unless what it is doing is correct, unless it can end up being of\nservice and being protective for the tribe, for the community, for those who are dependent, then there is nothing to do. \"Why should I use my ego power to sell soap when it is not going to be productive and be\nof value to the community?\"\n\nThe strong ego whose influence is justified by the correctness of its actions; or The expression of the ego as a role whose influence is symbolic and lacks authority. Most 26.6's look like the detriment; very few\nlive out the exaltation. Other ego people coming into contact with them, but particularly undefined egos are deeply impressed because they seem to have enormous ego power but seem to be unusually humble\nbecause they don't do anything with their ego. They don't feel like they have to push it out because there is no sense in doing that unless there is the right moment.\n\nRemember something about the ego motor: the ego motor will just stop working. It just will. It will take a break. In the 26.6, like in the 40.6, it can take a break for life. It steps out until it meets a 44.6 in its\naloofness. The two of them will look at each other and say, \"You are not involved either; maybe we should do something.\" The 26 is pointed to awareness whereas the 40 is just pointed towards emotions.\n\nPage 7",

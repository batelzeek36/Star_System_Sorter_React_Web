      "heading": "Diversification",
      "raw": "First lines always speak for the nature of the hexagram. The first line is called Diversification. This is not synthesis. This is not the first line of the third hexagram. This is diversification. This is literally the\nfoundation of the experiential way. That is: not to do the same thing twice. This is the lesson for the abstract person. \"Do it once, have the experience, put it in your bank account and go on to the next thing.\"\nThe essence begins with diversification.\n\nSun exalted. The ability when surplus resources are available to extend one's activities beyond their normal scope. On the logic side, we are stuck with patterns and habits. That is the logic side. It is about\npatterns and habits which lock you into a fixed way of living out your process. The abstract comes along and says, \"I have to go beyond these patterns and habits in order to have my experience.\" The surplus\nresources to go beyond just the strict patterns to find that additional experience.\n\nVenus in detriment. A tendency when surplus resources are available to centrifugal application.\nDecadence. In the white book it says: Growth through expansion, particularly when defined to the root; or\nToo much expansion can lead to decadence. Now look, the decadence in this is what happens to your energy the moment that you are placing your energy commitments in too many places. This is something\nthat comes back to one of the most important things that you can do in a reading for people.\n\nWhen people have a defined sacral center, people who are generators by nature, for them to understand that only when their sacral center makes the commitment as \"uh-huh\" are they really going to have the\nenergy and not descend into decadence. What so often happens to sacral people is that they make their decisions in life based on other places (their emotional system, their throat or their mind) and, in doing so,\nthey literally do become decadent in the way they are using their energy because most of that energy is not going towards their process experientially but is being fed off to others.\n\nPage 1\n\nThis can create all kinds of energy problems in the human being themselves, aside from the dilemma of people who say, \"You have broken your word, your promise or this commitment.\" The 42 is always under\npressure to finish things, so it can feel very guilty when it can't finish things. This is the decadence that can come in. Without the clarity to understand where the energy goes. Remember that there is no\nawareness here. There is the energy to grow and complete but there is no awareness. There is the energy to be diversified, but how diversified? How far out do you go? How many different experiences do you\ngo after? Are they really for you? If they are not, they will eat up your energy."

      "heading": "Identification",
      "raw": "The first line, due to its introspective nature, recognizes that it has a resource and that those resources can be available for all kinds of diversity. It does not know what to do with it but nonetheless, it knows that\nthat is there. When you come to the second line, the projective line, you know that they do not know whether they have the resources or not. What they are doing is that they are projecting out that they have\ntheir resources.\n\nThe line is called Identification. Sun exalted. Recognition and acute capitalization of trends. Remember that somebody who has anything in the abstract process is always interested in a new experience that\ncomes along. They are the first ones. When I go and give public lectures, the room is filled with 1 1 /56's.\nThey just come and say, \"Aha, a new idea, something new and different to think about! Some new possible experience!\" The identification is literally being able to make your energy (projected) available,\nand then the diversity is shown to you, in that sense.\n\nThe whole thing about that is that you don't really know, as a second line, whether you really have the resources. You can identify that. You can recognize that straight away, \"Aha, there is an experience, a\nnew thing that is available to me.\" You are projecting out but you don't really know if it is for you. You do not really know if you can handle it. This is not about awareness.\n\nThe Venusian detriment: An ascetically motivated withdrawal in times of progressive change. These are people that are projecting out their resource and then, all of a sudden, everything around them changes\nand there is this sense that what they are projecting out does not fit in anymore. In other words, on both sides of this line is this capacity to be able to project out exactly into a new experience to see whether one\nhas what it takes or not. Or, at the very same time, to recognize that there is something different going on, some new experience that is available, but not feeling equipped. Remember that the second line always\nhas this dilemma of not knowing whether or not there is the necessary depth, the necessary tools.\n\nIn the white book: Power for growth through participating in trends. The moment that these people see a new trend, they can project their energy into it. The other side of this is: Growth which stops in reaction to\ntrends or change. Because, all of a sudden, they are out of step. They can be in step or they can be out of step, but it is all a projection. There is no guarantee of the depth underneath."

      "heading": "Trial and Error",
      "raw": "Everything that we have been talking about in terms of third lines, here, you get to see the archetype of what a third line is. After all, when you are dealing with the abstract, you are dealing with the experiential\nway. You are dealing with the human process and the keynote of the third line is Trial and Error. This is the term that we have been using: trial and error, bonds made and broken. In times of increase... You can\nsubstitute growth for 'increase'. This is the maturing process. How we grow is through trial and error.\n...mistakes are a natural part of the process.\n\nPage 2\n\nMars exalted. The energy and assertion to turn mistakes into advantages. This is so difficult for people to recognize. What they call a mistake is only a point on an arc of a path. It is not something that you have to\ngo back to. We do not go back to anything. We are flying at 445,000 kilometers an hour in space. You cannot turn around at that speed. You can't even put on the brakes at that speed. There is nothing to do\nabout that. It is very important to understand that. So look, the mistakes become advantages. That is the nature of growth.\n\nIn this line you see a phenomenon that all parents know with their children. When children are young and they get sick with a fever, they grow. If you measure them two days later, they have grown. You can look\nat the sickness and say, \"Oh, my goodness. Here is a failure. The child is not well. I did not look after it properly.\" The fact is that that illness is an advantage because the illness itself is part of the growth\nprocess. Otherwise, it would not be there. It is very important to understand the essence of trial and error.\nWe have an obsession with 'no mistakes.' No mistakes? You might as well die because there is no growth and maturity and there is no process.\n\nOn the other side of this, the Moon in detriment. A moodiness that in error may succumb to brooding and unnecessary caution. \"Oh, I made a mistake. It is terrible. I have to be careful next time. I will not do that\nagain.\"\n\nThe power to accept mistakes as part of the growth. Here is Mars, the twelve-year-old child in all its glory. This is one of the best positions you can have for Mars in your design. Mars saying, \"Yes, I have\nthe power to grow.\"\n\nMistakes give power to moodiness and caution. Trial and error really is the essence. Remember that the resonance to the third line is always the sixth line, the possibility for a profound mutation, for a transition\nto take place. Growth is rooted in trial and error."

      "heading": "The Middle Man",
      "raw": "When you come to the fourth line, you come to the upper trigram. We now have a transpersonal process.\nThere is this recognition of what is at the other end of the channel and so we have a totally different process. Always remember the limitation that is there in the first three lines: this deep involvement in the\nnature of the gate itself. \"I have the resources, I project the resources, I adapt to the resources.\" But it is still within itself.\n\nWhen you get to the fourth line, you get to something different. This transpersonal is the beginning of the recognition that, in order for experience to be achieved, it has to be achieved through union with others, in\nconsort or connection with others. This line, by the way, is a line that I have seen in, I think now, seven different midwives.\n\nThis line is called The middle man. It should probably be called the midwife. This would be a great line to call the midwife because this is the energy to provide the resources by being in the middle, in mediation,\nproviding the resources for others. In other words, there is this intrinsic recognition that the maturity cannot be established alone.\n\nThe Moon exalted. The quintessential manifestation of the mediator. On the Venusian side we have: the gift to establish and maintain relationships is ill-suited in this position to act in mediation, where harmony\nmust take a back seat to pragmatism. This is about using these resources carefully, not simply working on the social level of recognizing that there is another end of the channel.\n\nPage 3\n\nRemember that collective circuitry is, by its very nature, social. So, underneath all of these lines is lying this social imperative that says, \"I have to share this.\" Here in the fourth line it is, \"I have to share my\nresources.\" What happens is that, in the detriment, they get caught up in the social aspect, trying to make sure that everybody is harmonious and that everything is okay, instead of putting the energy into their real\nbusiness. That is like a woman being in labor and the midwife is putting her energy into trying to be harmonic with this woman who is in labor, instead of putting her energy right there to what the process is.\n\nThere are times when the social aspect takes away from the necessary pragmatism. These are people that have wonderful energy but, so often, their energy is used by other people. Their resources are given away\nto others simply because they want to establish a harmonic social environment and that becomes more important than just pragmatically using the energy.\n\nThe maturity to bring growth through mediation. To bring growth to the collective, in that sense, by having the resources. Fourth lines are very fixed. \"I am fixed on having to give my resources to others. I\nhave to share my resources with others.\"\n\nIn the detriment we have: A lack of maturity where the power to harmonize distorts mediation and limits growth. If you are so busy trying to make sure that your client who is in labor is going to like you as a\nperson, you may have all kinds of difficulties in the actual birthing because the energy is in the wrong place. It is like the surgeon who is cutting open your heart and listening to rock and roll at the same time\nand gets lost in the song, and you end up with a pair of scissors inside."

      "heading": "Self-actualization",
      "raw": "Look at the incredible resonance in this gate. The first line and the fourth line, the second and the fifth line, all have Venus in detriment. Here is a fundamentally collective process and the Venus in detriment\nalways brings out problems because it brings out the problems of being over-concerned about the social aspect of experience. This is not about the social aspects of experience. It is about the pragmatism of\nrecognizing the nature of the experience itself but you can see that the Venusian power here can distort the resources.\n\nRemember that, in the first line, we always have the essence, to diversify the resources, and when we get to the fifth line, we get to see how the world looks at it. The world calls it Self-actualization. They project\non the 42.5: \"Aha, they have the resources to be able to go through a process and grow. They are the ones who are mature.\" This is a very funny thing. 42.5's are always being projected on that they are the mature\nones. \"They are so mature for their age.\" This is the flavor that comes with the 42.5.\n\nThe Sun exalted. The fulfillment and actualization of purpose as a natural path, whose reward is a healthy sense of self, rather than the power and influence that naturally follow. This projecting out, this projection\non them that they have the resources, the fact that they can bring that out: the moment that somebody projects on you that you are something,' it becomes easier and easier to live it out. If somebody keeps on\nprojecting on you that you have power, then you have power. These people are projected on all the time that they have the resources. So they have them. Maybe not always, but most of the time, they do.\n\nThe Venusian detriment. Self-actualization as a strictly inner experience that may demand or result in a reclusive nature. This is not the fourth that says, \"I must share because I am the resonance of\ndiversification. I have to share with everybody. I have to be in the middle.\" The resonance to the five is the two, which is to be identified with here.\n\nThe detriment here is not really a detriment. It is simply that this growth power is going to be \"my own\" growth power. \"I have an inner growth process rather than helping you with your growth process. You\n\nPage 4\n\ncan project on me that I have the resources for you, but I do not identify with where you are going and I will not give you that energy.\"\n\nThe two sides of this in the white book: Growth that is self-fulfilling and naturally leads to influence, or\nInner growth that empowers reclusiveness. \"I will do my own experience.\" These are often people that do things that nobody else knows about. They have this mask in their life. You work with them for five years\nand then you discover that twice a year they take off all their clothes, they paint their body and they slaughter animals and do weird religious acts. You don't know that because it is a reclusive inner\nexperience that they will not share with you.\n\nI had a reading with some guy, a really insecure and uncomfortable, strange sort of creature, working in a government job in Munich. I got to a place in the reading which triggered something for him and he said,\n\"I've just been through that.\" And I asked, \"You have been through what?\" \"Oh, last week, I have been doing fire walking.\" I looked at this guy and thought, 'fire walking.' 42.5. These are people that have\nhidden experiences in their life, so they have a lot of things that they have actually done but they do not tell anybody about. That can range from anything, to anywhere because the abstract circuit, being what it\nis, anything is possible in the experiential field. They are very secretive, in that sense, about the nature of their inner experiences."

      "raw": "When you get to the sixth line and you get to transition, you get to the classic situation in which the sixth line does not necessarily want to release what is there, unless there is much more to it. After all, the whole\nnature of the abstract process is to go through experience so that, at the end of that experience, when you have completed that process, you can reflect upon that process and out of that comes your maturity. Out\nof that comes what we call history: the ability to be able to share with others the nature of your experience.\n\nHere, when you get to it in the white book it is very clear: The power to share the process of growth with others. Perhaps. You only share the process of growth if the experience can be seen, in that sense; if they\ncan believe that it is going to lead to that kind of growth. That is full of all kinds of 'ifs', 'buts,' 'maybes', 'should haves', 'could haves', and 'I don't knows'. They are not necessarily going to share it, but they can.\n\nOn the other side we have: The refusal to share the benefits of growth with others. The Nurturing, in the black book: A natural and instinctive nurturing of others. Saturn in detriment. A restrictive and malefic\nmaterialism that is selfalienating and encourages aggression.\n\nThis is one of the sixth lines that can get a lot of hostility because everybody knows that they have the resources and everybody is saying, \"Why don't you give these things out. You are collective and this is\nabout sharing. We want it.\"\n\nSo they can go to the extreme, and again, this is dependent on the nature of the design, whether the center is defined and how this operates. They can get to the point where they react in that way only to use their\nresources for their own benefit.\n\nMaterialism, in the sense that energy has value. I am somebody that has three motors open. I know how valuable energy is. I teach on your adrenaline. It is not mine. I know how valuable it is. That adrenaline\nenergy is a necessary currency. Without it, there is no fuel for the process.\n\nPeople who carry energy gates like this are carrying wealth within them. The moment that the energy is used properly, the growth comes and then you reap the harvest of whatever has grown. The harvest in life\n\nPage 5\n\nis to come to grips with what it is to be human, what it is to be alive, what it is to live out the experiential way. Like all sixth lines, it is not certain whether or not it is worthwhile, whether it can trust that the\nprocess is valuable for its growth.\n\nThis wonderful joke: where does the 42.6 lead to? To Synthesis in the 3.1. It starts with Diversification and you get to the end of the whole thing and you say, \"Well, yes, all this diversity is terrific, but what\ndoes it all mean?\" That is what the sixth line is thinking about. What does it all mean? Not just this experience. What you get from the nature of the sixth line is that they are not ready to make the mistake\nthat is made in the third line. They are saying \"What for? What do I have to go through that for? I am not really sure that it is of value to me.\" There is always a hesitancy in the sixth line because there is this\ninherent sense of \"Yeah, but what else?\"\n\nPage 6"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 42 INCREASE\n\nWe are dealing with the collective process here. We are dealing with the collective power of the sacral center. One of the things to recognize about the nature of the collective, and it is something that you\nshould always keep in mind when you are looking at somebody's chart or definition, that the collective is not personal. The whole nature of collective circuitry is that, inherent in it is the capacity and the need to\nbe able to share. The reality is that it is the most social of all circuitry and, in that sense, it is the most social of all energy. It is energy that is there to be shared for collective purposes. The collective abstract\nprocess is about the energy for experience.\n\nIt is very important to understand that our abstract process defines the nature of what it is to be alive in the world. It defines what it is to be human and what our human process is: that is, moving from one\nexperience to another so that we can learn from that experience. When we begin here with the 42nd hexagram, Increase, we begin with this process of the energy or the power to be able to complete the\nnecessary energy in order to be able to make a commitment to a life experience. So, the 42nd hexagram starts this process of energizing the possibility of being able to go through a complete experience.\n\nIt says above the lines: The expansion of the resources which maximizes the development of full potential. The full potential to go through the human experience. This channel, Maturation, is a design of\nbalanced development. Yet, everybody who deals with the nature of the abstract is always saying, \"Yes, wait a minute, now.\" It is full of crisis, change and instability. There is all this emotional up and down\nthat goes with it. But this is the human experiential way.\n\n42.1 Diversification\n\nFirst lines always speak for the nature of the hexagram. The first line is called Diversification. This is not synthesis. This is not the first line of the third hexagram. This is diversification. This is literally the\nfoundation of the experiential way.

This is the decadence that can come in. Without the clarity to understand where the energy goes. Remember that there is no\nawareness here. There is the energy to grow and complete but there is no awareness. There is the energy to be diversified, but how diversified? How far out do you go? How many different experiences do you\ngo after? Are they really for you? If they are not, they will eat up your energy.\n\n42.2 Identification\n\nThe first line, due to its introspective nature, recognizes that it has a resource and that those resources can be available for all kinds of diversity. It does not know what to do with it but nonetheless, it knows that\nthat is there.

Trial and error really is the essence. Remember that the resonance to the third line is always the sixth line, the possibility for a profound mutation, for a transition\nto take place. Growth is rooted in trial and error.\n\n42.4 The Middle Man\n\nWhen you come to the fourth line, you come to the upper trigram. We now have a transpersonal process.\nThere is this recognition of what is at the other end of the channel and so we have a totally different process.

The first line and the fourth line, the second and the fifth line, all have Venus in detriment. Here is a fundamentally collective process and the Venus in detriment\nalways brings out problems because it brings out the problems of being over-concerned about the social aspect of experience. This is not about the social aspects of experience.

If somebody keeps on\nprojecting on you that you have power, then you have power. These people are projected on all the time that they have the resources. So they have them. Maybe not always, but most of the time, they do.\n\nThe Venusian detriment. Self-actualization as a strictly inner experience that may demand or result in a reclusive nature. This is not the fourth that says, \"I must share because I am the resonance of\ndiversification. I have to share with everybody. I have to be in the middle.\" The resonance to the five is the two, which is to be identified with here.\n\nThe detriment here is not really a detriment. It is simply that this growth power is going to be \"my own\" growth power. \"I have an inner growth process rather than helping you with your growth process. You\n\nPage 4\n\ncan project on me that I have the resources for you, but I do not identify with where you are going and I will not give you that energy.\"\n\nThe two sides of this in the white book: Growth that is self-fulfilling and naturally leads to influence, or\nInner growth that empowers reclusiveness. \"I will do my own experience.\" These are often people that do things that nobody else knows about. They have this mask in their life. You work with them for five years\nand then you discover that twice a year they take off all their clothes, they paint their body and they slaughter animals and do weird religious acts. You don't know that because it is a reclusive inner\nexperience that they will not share with you.\n\nI had a reading with some guy, a really insecure and uncomfortable, strange sort of creature, working in a government job in Munich. I got to a place in the reading which triggered something for him and he said,\n\"I've just been through that.\" And I asked, \"You have been through what?\" \"Oh, last week, I have been doing fire walking.\" I looked at this guy and thought, 'fire walking.' 42.5. These are people that have\nhidden experiences in their life, so they have a lot of things that they have actually done but they do not tell anybody about. That can range from anything, to anywhere because the abstract circuit, being what it\nis, anything is possible in the experiential field. They are very secretive, in that sense, about the nature of their inner experiences.\n\n42.6 Nurturing\n\nWhen you get to the sixth line and you get to transition, you get to the classic situation in which the sixth line does not necessarily want to release what is there, unless there is much more to it. After all, the whole\nnature of the abstract process is to go through experience so that, at the end of that experience, when you have completed that process, you can reflect upon that process and out of that comes your maturity. Out\nof that comes what we call history: the ability to be able to share with others the nature of your experience.\n\nHere, when you get to it in the white book it is very clear: The power to share the process of growth with others. Perhaps. You only share the process of growth if the experience can be seen, in that sense; if they\ncan believe that it is going to lead to that kind of growth. That is full of all kinds of 'ifs', 'buts,' 'maybes', 'should haves', 'could haves', and 'I don't knows'. They are not necessarily going to share it, but they can.\n\nOn the other side we have: The refusal to share the benefits of growth with others. The Nurturing, in the black book: A natural and instinctive nurturing of others. Saturn in detriment. A restrictive and malefic\nmaterialism that is selfalienating and encourages aggression.\n\nThis is one of the sixth lines that can get a lot of hostility because everybody knows that they have the resources and everybody is saying, \"Why don't you give these things out. You are collective and this is\nabout sharing. We want it.\"\n\nSo they can go to the extreme, and again, this is dependent on the nature of the design, whether the center is defined and how this operates. They can get to the point where they react in that way only to use their\nresources for their own benefit.\n\nMaterialism, in the sense that energy has value. I am somebody that has three motors open. I know how valuable energy is. I teach on your adrenaline. It is not mine. I know how valuable it is. That adrenaline\nenergy is a necessary currency. Without it, there is no fuel for the process.\n\nPeople who carry energy gates like this are carrying wealth within them. The moment that the energy is used properly, the growth comes and then you reap the harvest of whatever has grown. The harvest in life\n\nPage 5\n\nis to come to grips with what it is to be human, what it is to be alive, what it is to live out the experiential way. Like all sixth lines, it is not certain whether or not it is worthwhile, whether it can trust that the\nprocess is valuable for its growth.\n\nThis wonderful joke: where does the 42.6 lead to? To Synthesis in the 3.1. It starts with Diversification and you get to the end of the whole thing and you say, \"Well, yes, all this diversity is terrific, but what\ndoes it all mean?\" That is what the sixth line is thinking about. What does it all mean? Not just this experience. What you get from the nature of the sixth line is that they are not ready to make the mistake\nthat is made in the third line. They are saying \"What for? What do I have to go through that for? I am not really sure that it is of value to me.\" There is always a hesitancy in the sixth line because there is this\ninherent sense of \"Yeah, but what else?\"\n\nPage 6",

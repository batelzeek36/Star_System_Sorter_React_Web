      "heading": "Disengagement",
      "raw": "It is called Disengagement. The basis of provocation is to back away. This is one of the deepest provocations of all. Think about what that means, genetically. The moment that the 39 disengages, there\nis no mutation.\n\nMars exalted. The determination when confronted by obstacles to withdraw, but only temporarily.\nUnderstand the nature of the foundation. It is looking inward. It is trying to understand what provocation is and, the moment that it provokes, the moment that it is dealing with its capacity to provoke, it always\nends up in situations where that leads to a reaction and they withdraw, but only temporarily. In other words, they will go through it again and again.\n\nThe energy to provoke by refusing to confront obstacles. The obstacle is the resulting provocation in the other. Think about that. When you are provoking somebody, you tease them. What you are teasing is that\nyou need to get exactly the right potential for that teasing. Not everybody will respond in the same way.\n\nPage 2\n\nThose people who will be provoked by that teasing are not for you, but you have to find who is for you.\nThus, you keep on provoking and every time you meet the obstacle, their response to that provocation, you back away and try to find another one.\n\nYou are looking for the spirit. Understand that the 39th gate is a gate that has deep inside of it the only instrument that is out there to look for the spirit. When these human beings stop provoking, we have less\nand less people who are looking for the spirit. For every 39, there is a resonance in the world. The spirit can be found but it is a research, after all.\n\nMercury in detriment. Disengagement, with an accompanying indecision as to when to re engage. There is a good sound biological reason why the foundation for this gate which is seeking to find the spirit for\nmutation, is being held back in this disengagement, because we do not want all kinds of mutations in the world. Just because something is a mutation, it will not inherently guarantee that it is a good mutation. It\ncan be a bad one. A bad mutation is when the 39 provokes someone and they try to stay instead of withdrawing when this person gets provoked. Thus, you will have a negative mutation right away and it\nwill manifest in the quality of that relationship because it then is contentious, caught in the mood swing and the spirit is not there, but only the motor. This is a way of holding back from too many mutations.\n\nThe value of this kind of education is when people who carry the energy of the 39 begin to recognize the value of what that gate is. In order to do so, they all have to develop what I call a thick skin. If you\nprovoke somebody and they get provoked, you know that they are not for you. They will put up an energy vibration that is sent towards you which says, \"This person is a provoker and this person is not nice,\" or\nother gossip told. If people talk about the 39 behind their back or into their face, they do not necessarily like that.\n\nThis is the whole thing about being a 39. That is why there are so few people in the world that are truly looking for the spirit. Most of them are engaged in disengagement. They are pulling back. They provoke,\nthey get the reaction and then pull away. This is what most of the planet is doing with this energy."

      "heading": "Confrontation",
      "raw": "The second line is always projecting outwards. The 39.2 is projecting outwards that they are provocative and therefore, other people can treat them accordingly and respond, even when they are not provocative.\nWhat happens to these people is that, because everybody responds to that provocation, they end up having to deal with it a lot.\n\nThe second line is called Confrontation. That is what they get. By the way, you can notice that the second, the fourth and the sixth line have the Moon exalted. One of the easiest ways of thinking of the Moon is to\nrecognize that it is what moves and drives us. When the Moon is exalted, this is a very powerful force because we get a constant cycle every 28 days of the Moon coming back to this line and reinforcing this,\nor when it is at the other side of the definition.\n\nHere, The instinctual and direct assault of obstacles. These people are projected on that they are provocative. You are sitting with somebody who is describing to you what the ABC is. The 39.2 is sitting\nthere and does not say a single word, does not stare, does not look funny, does not make any motions, does not do anything, and the person who just described the ABC turns to the 39.2 and says, \"What is the\nmatter with that?\" The 39.2 inside is saying, \"What me?\" and starts stuttering some excuse. What is necessary is the direct assault on the obstacle: \"Nothing. I was not paying any attention to you.\" They get\nthis presumption all the time, this projection that they are ready to be provocative.\n\nPage 3\n\nIn the white book: The energy to provoke through direct assault. These are people that have to deliver this direct assault. They have people coming right at them and say, \"Why are you looking at me so strange?\"\n\"I am not looking at you at all.\" This answer is just as provocative in response. They give the direct assault back.\n\nJupiter in detriment. The principle of preservation that tempts one to go around an obstacle that should be tackled headon. In the white book: An emotional discomfort when direct assault is essential. Think about\nwhat happens to these people. They are so used to being picked on because that is how they feel. They feel like they are being picked on. \"Why do you pick on me? I did not say anything. I did not look at you\nfunny. I did not do anything. Leave me alone.\" The people with the Jupiter in detriment get the direct assault and they do everything in their power to get away from that provocation. They do not go right\nback and say, \"You idiot. Why do you look at me?\" They try to say, \"Really, no, no. Did I look like that?\nI did not mean to. I am really sorry that you thought that I thought that you are funny.\" These people get very angry. The other person will find that answer just as provocative as the direct assault. The 39 never\ngets outside of the game."

      "heading": "Responsibility",
      "raw": "We come to the completion of the lower trigram, to the trial and error process, to the learning process.\nThis is the resonance to the sixth line and the potential of wisdom. The third line is called Responsibility and here you begin to see the root of what will ultimately be, in the 39.6, the fuel for the 55.6, which will\nlead to the mutation.\n\nThis is the trial and error process of learning to get to this point, and the first thing that we see in this is:\nThe avoidance of confronting obstacles if failure puts others at risk. This 'others at risk' sounds strange because we are dealing with an individual fuel in an individual channel and circuit. Yet, built into it is a\ngenetic recognition of the power of mutation to change everything, either positively or negatively.\n\nWe have Jupiter in detriment. The great benefic whose first consideration is for the larger framework. In the white book: The energy to provoke through self-sacrifice. For example, you have a teacher who is\nbullying the children in the classroom, provoking them, and you have one child who carries this 39.3 energy who will make the sacrifice in order to protect the others. They will go up to that teacher and\nchallenge him. This child will get into trouble, will have to leave the school, will be punished. If this child will not make this self-sacrifice, others will be at risk.\n\nThe responsibility in the third line is this early recognition of the responsibility of being a mutative force.\nThat responsibility is not simply for the individual. Sometimes the provocation has to be for the benefit of others. These are the people in any kind of group situation that do the provoking for others. They,\nthemselves, might well prefer not to get involved because trial and error means mistakes and punishment.\nBut because nobody can, they do, because is built in.\n\nThe Earth in detriment. The often disastrous assumption that others are more at risk if an obstacle is not confronted. The white book: The energy to provoke through the failure to make sacrifices. They do not\nmake the sacrifice and provoke others through that behavior. In the same situation in the classroom, the capacity to provoke on behalf of everyone, but not doing it. This is extremely individual.\n\nThe third line is starting the process of seeing that the individual mutation always has to be ready for sacrifice, always. The moment that you have a mutative force in the world, there are forces that want to\ndestroy it. All individuals, as freaks, are subject to being stoned and, the moment that one is ready to make a mutative provocation for the benefit of others, it becomes the focus of that field of energy.\nSacrifice is built into bringing mutation. There is no mutation without sacrifice.\n\nPage 4"

      "heading": "Temperance",
      "raw": "We come to the fourth line, to the beginning of the upper trigram. It is about being unidirectional; it is about being fixed and one -minded. This fourth line is one of the great lines of the 384 lines. It is such a\ncomplex line. Even the language of this line, its keynotes come from everywhere.\n\nThe fourth line is called Temperance. It sounds very much like the introduction to the 12th hexagram.\nCareful evaluation and assessment before taking action. Before provoking. The nature of the gate is not about doing; it is about provoking.\n\nMoon exalted. The values of feelings and instincts in establishing the proper timing. Feelings have nothing to do with this stream. Instincts have nothing to do with this stream, either. Timing has nothing to\ndo with this stream. We have already looked at the abstract, the tribal and the collective in that one sentence. Three keynotes from three different fields is a very complex energy.\n\nThe values of feelings and instincts in establishing the proper timing. This means: when to provoke.\nUnderstand the beauty of this line. This line is the first time that we can go across the channel. It has the recognition that there is something else on the other side of the channel. The moment that it recognizes\nthe forces on the other side, it says, \"Oh. There is a big emotional motor over there and it is going up and down in a wave. If I don't choose the right time, I will never get the right spirit.\"\n\nIn terms of the white book: The energy to provoke at exactly the right time. This is the magic and the fixation of the fourth line: when is the right time? Because of that, they externalize at different times until\nthey learn. These are the kind of people that only provoke you on Mondays or when you tell them that you have a headache. They find out at what time to provoke you to get a maximum impact, to see whether\nor not you have the right spirit.\n\nThe other side of this energy has the Sun in detriment. The faulty belief that willpower alone can overcome any obstacle regardless of circumstances. 'Willpower': this keynote belongs to the tribal\ncircuitry. You see that this energy is very complex. You have all kinds of keynotes coming from the whole body graph. This whole field is the fuel for mutation. It is not the fuel to initiate mutation. It is not\nthe 3/60. It is the fuel to bring that mutation out into the world and allow it to spread. It is very powerful in that sense.\n\nIn the white book: The energy to provoke that ignores circumstances. This energy does not wait for the right time. These people end up being a pain in the neck because they are always provoking you at the\nwrong time. If it is the right time to provoke somebody when they have a headache, do not provoke them when they do not have one because you will get crushed. You keep on persisting to provoke them\nwhenever you feel like it, instead of recognizing that there is a right time for that."

      "heading": "Single-mindedness",
      "raw": "The fifth line is always being projected upon, so anybody that carries this fifth line is projected on as being provocative. Due to that projection, they do not have to provoke very much because people get out\nof their way, unless they are really looking for a fight. So, people avoid getting involved at any kind of difficult level with the 39.5 people.\n\nThis line is called Single-mindedness. The rare ability not to overcome but to bypass obstacles. There is no one to be provoked out there, in that sense. They do not get a chance. What happens to these people is\nthat they very rarely find the right spirit. This is a time that we are living in. The 39 provokes to find the\n\nPage 5\n\nspirit. That is its true nature. That is the first line. The fifth line is how everybody else sees it. How everybody else sees it as wrong. What they see is that provocation should not be necessary and it is\nsomething to be avoided. If provocation is avoided, no spirit can be found. These people are projected on that they are single-minded, that they are the ones that can get it done. They do not run into any problems\nbecause they do not get the constant provocation because other people are very aware of this capacity in them.\n\nNeptune exalted. The imagination to establish new patterns that make the obstacles irrelevant. The moment that the obstacles are irrelevant, the spirit is gone. Think about that. The moment that it is\nprojected on you that you are provocative, so \"let's not provoke them,\" there is no chance to find the spirit. But this is what the totality wants out of that fifth line. This is their projection on what this fuel is\nall about.\n\nThe Mars in detriment. Simple hardheadedness. Though less exalted, it can often result in success and gather support by its very determination. It is amazing how many people are mutated by these 39.5's\nbecause, rather than going through the provocation with them, they just accept whatever it is in the mood, and they can often pull people along with them, but the spirit is missing. This is the whole thing. It is so\nimportant that when you are working with people that have the 39th gate, that they truly understand what provocation is for. It is there to find the right spirit. The right spirit is the spirit that is not provoked. You\ncan cheat by doing the fifth line number. The fifth line number is, \"Let's see. There does not seem to be any provocation out there, so everything is okay\" It does not work that way.\n\nIn our evolutionary process, we are slowly moving towards the sixth line. We are actually in the fifth line phase which is the great projected phase. So, we have the most complex Maya now that the planet has\never had. We have an enormous projected Maya around us. That is the density of the fifth line.\nEverything about our world is about projection now, our concepts about each other, the universe, and god.\nAll of that is part of a vast projection field and all of that is through the fifth line, universalization, because we are all living this global village consciousness. It is part of the process to go through this fifth\nline phase so we can complete all of that because the spirit comes afterwards. It can't come now. It does not exist now."

    "6": {
      "heading": "The Troubleshooter",
      "raw": "The Troubleshooter is an American Western term. They used to have these characters that could take you across the country in carriages. The person who was sitting beside the driver was called the\ntroubleshooter. If any trouble came along, this person would shoot it. This is where the word 'troubleshooter' comes from.\n\nLike all sixth lines, we have a transition field here. It goes beyond the nature of the hexagram and looks for much more. What the 39.6 is looking at is, \"Can we get this mutation into the world and, once it is in\nthe world, will it be of value to humanity?' That is its process. You can see what the beauty of provocation is, at its highest level. Provocation, at its highest level, is nothing more than the capacity to\ngo to somebody else and provide them, empower them, with mutation. \"I know what is wrong with your life.\" \"Get out of my face,\" is the answer of a lot of people who do not like anybody coming up to them to\ntell them what their problem is. \"Can I help you with this? Can I show you how to do this?\"\n\nNothing is more provocative in this life than somebody coming up to you and telling you what is wrong with you, and that they will fix it. Due to the nature of sixth lines, most of these troubleshooters never\nlook for trouble and do not shoot. They just hope that the riot will be very quiet and everything will be okay. Their inherent gift is this capacity of penetrating to the core of what somebody's dilemma is. Not\n\nPage 6\n\ntheir own. Recognize how altruistic and special that is. Mutation is for the whole specie and never for the individuals. It is for the whole specie. Otherwise, it is of no value.\n\nSo, the ultimate field here is as it says in the white book: The energy to provoke others by attempting to solve their problems. The 39 is provoking to find the right spirit. So, anybody who is going to listen to\nthese very gifted people is the right spirit. To be able to offer this mutation is a very gifted fuel: those people take the mutation and move it along.\n\nIn the black book it says: The natural gift for solving problems. It is a gift. What that ultimately means is that the final stage in our process, this mutation, will solve our problems. To get rid of these bodies is one\nway to solve our problems. It is just about changing the equipment. But nonetheless, you get to the point that you have problem-solving. What you will also have is when the 39 really has this capacity and when\nwe get to the stage where the mutation takes place, it is a natural gift that will be accepted by others because they are a very important mutative force.\n\nMoon exalted. Practicality and the ability to guide and nurture others. These people get blown off so fast.\nIn our work together, we are dealing with our adult consciousness, but you start your life with your design. If you have a 39.6 child and it says to you, \"I don't think that you know what you are doing in the\nkitchen,\" or \"You don't know how to run the computer,\" think about what happens to this 39.6 child. They have a natural gift for solving problems but it is provocative and they get rejected a lot for that\nprovocation. That puts them in a bad mood because we are dealing with a mood gate and they feel terrible and then they say, \"I don't care. I won't help them or tell them what is wrong. They will give me a hard\ntime. They will not do that.\" Always remember that when you are looking at any line, think about it first as a child's line before you think about it as an adult line. You get to see that so much of what is there in\nthe beginning is already deeply conditioned by the forces around it and so few of these aspects get a chance to flourish because of that.\n\nAll 39 children know what that is like. That provocation always was in them. They already provoked you as a baby. Some of these babies get thrown against walls. Recognize that you start your life with your\ndesign and see it in that perspective, and then you begin to understand what it may or may not be like. In most cases, 39.6's do not provoke anything. It is rare. It has to do with the spirit that is available. If there\nis the right spirit, there is the opportunity for them to always release their wisdom. All sixth lines carry the potential of wisdom. They can release the wisdom of what the problem is and how to solve that problem.\nRemember that it is a genetic gift. There is no awareness here. It is simply the capacity in that fuel to deal with any dilemma and to be able to mutate it.\n\nOn the other side: The emotional drive to dominate that provokes others. In the black book we have Mars in detriment. Ego dominance that generally abuses this gift for self-aggrandizement and personal ambition\nrather than for the benefit of others. It is so difficult for these people when they are growing up because they can't solve problems if they go the other way. They insist for the rest of their lives that they are the\nonly ones in the world that can solve any problem and that others had better pay attention to them or nothing is going to happen. Both of those stances are not provoking at all when it is obvious that it is\nthere because we take in each other's auras. Or provoking insistently and again, remember that most of the time, the potential of the sixth line does not come out because it has already been held back in the youth.\nThere will be exceptions.\n\nWhen we have the transition that is going to take place, when this movement takes place and this begins to open up, these people will really be of value in society. It will be a time for them when they will\nflourish because their gifts are essential to maintain the spirit field. The individual stream maintains it.\n\nPage 7\n\nRemember that the 39 is coming out of the root center. The Troubleshooters are under enormous pressure to solve problems. They have no other way. That is their nature and they have to recognize when not to\nprovoke. \"If I can't solve your problems, I will stop eating.\" We have people who do that all the time.\nThat is the ultimate 39.6 provocation. \"You do not treat us well in our independence movement, so will we all stop eating.\" Or the other way around: people who can't solve the problem and get fat.\n\nPage 8"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 39 OBSTRUCTION\n\nWe move to the 39th gate and we come to the individual process. Whenever we are dealing with the stream of Emoting, whenever we are dealing with this individual stream that operates through the solar\nplex system, we know that this is the stream in which we are going to have the metamorphosis or the mutation taking place that will open up the potential to release the spirit consciousness that lies within the\nsolar plex system. We know that the event itself is keyed to the 55th hexagram, to the sixth line. Keep in mind that the 55.6 is a potential which operates correctly when it is being fueled by the 39th gate. The\n39th gate, as a fuel, is going to make its contribution to this metamorphosis that is going to take place in our emotional process.\n\nThe 39th gate is the gate of Obstruction, and it is the gate of provocation. It is the energy to provoke or not. In sexual terms, this theme is about teasing. This energy provokes in order to find the right spirit.\nThis is one of the gates that could be best understood through the negative.\n\nThat is, provocation is there to find out who can not be provoked. If you try to provoke somebody and they are not provoked, that spirit is correct for you. If you can provoke somebody, that spirit is not correct\nfor you. The provocation tries to find the right potential for that fuel to feed, to find the right spirit. All of that can be very confusing because the 55 is in the wave. What appears to be the right spirit on Monday\nwill not be the right spirit on Tuesday. In the archetype of how this gate functions, the provocation is there to find the right spirit because, once linked to the correct spirit, there is the potential to emote, the\npotential to bring out the individual spirit and the capacity to bring mutation to manifestation, to bring it to everything else.\n\nThe individual is responsible for mutation in the plan. This is inherent in their design. You also have to see that there is no metamorphosis of the emotional system other than through the individual process. The\nindividual can only have impact on the tribe or the collective when it is truly in the right spirit, what most people confuse with the term 'enlightenment.' Most people confuse this pathway with this term. The\nindividual mutative force that is in the right mood, this spirit is infectious because it is there to move the mutation through the totality. The energy mechanic is the impulse which is rooted in the 3/60, in the\npulsing energy to eat. It is about what you eat.\n\nOne of my favorite statements for 39's is when somebody comes into your life, imagine if you have to eat with them. Would you really like to eat with them? 39's know that better than anybody else. Adults never\nreally get that, but if you ask children about the people around them, \"Who do you want to eat with?\" this is very revealing because they tell you spontaneously.\n\nIf you look at this stream and you look at the 12th gate which says caution and meditation in the face of temptation, you see that the 12th gate manifests the individual process in the throat. It is the gate of\ncaution. It is important to withstand the temptation to do. It is better to meditate and back away from acting. In the 39, we find the fuel for this process.\n\nThe heading above the lines says: The value of obstruction in provoking analysis, assessment and reevaluation. It is the very fuel for that caution. That is what provoking is all about. Provoking is a deeply\nselective process. It is a very important process. What is so difficult for people who carry this energy is that, because they automatically are provocative, and given the nature of the world, they get so many\npeople who are provoked by them. Because they are not the right spirit (not everybody is the right spirit), these people end up disliking the very value, the very essence of what they are. All of these themes can be\nseen in the first line in the foundation.\n\nPage 1\n\nWhat is successful in provocation once, in terms of the spirit, may not be the next time due to the emotional wave on the other side. The 39 people themselves have to recognize why they are provoking.\nThe 39 is a fuel, and it is not aware. So, they realize that they provoke naturally, and if they accept that, what they are only looking for is for the response of people who are not provoked by them (what I call the\nright spirit). In other words, if you have a certain kind of habit, like if you like to tap your feet while you are eating and you have somebody sitting beside you, and every time you are tapping your feet, the other\nperson starts going \"Ahem.\" This means that you are provoking them; thus they do not have the right spirit. Don't eat with them. If somebody else is there and doesn't mind your tapping, then you have found\nthe right spirit. Period. It is not sophisticated. It is simply the recognition that those aspects of your nature are provocative to some. Only the people to whom it is not provocative are for you. To provoke\n\"efficiently\" comes back to your own recognition.\n\nIf you carry the 39 energy within you, you have to recognize that people who are not provoked by you, in whatever situation, are right for you in that moment, in that time. They carry the right spirit. They may\nnot next time because this energy is directed to the emotional field, to the wave. So, it may work one moment and may not work the next. What you do discover over time is who is generally always provoked\nand who is generally not always provoked by you. Then you have succeeded.\n\nThe whole success for a 39 is to keep on provoking. In order to be yourself, you have to be provocative with the recognition why the provocation is there so that you are not uncomfortable when people do not\nlike your trip. The worst thing for any individual is somebody who says, \"I don't like the way you are doing that. Change it.\" This is very difficult for provocative people because they will always have people\naround telling them, \"Don't provoke me.\" This is like telling the sun not to shine. They 39's are what they are and that is their beauty.\n\nSo many gates have ways of deeply knowing what is correct for them. It is in their genetics. The gift of the 39 is to provoke. Otherwise, we do not have a way to get enough people together who are carrying a\ngood spirit. The good spirit comes from acceptance, like in The Troubleshooter; the wisdom of a 39 saying, \"That is where the problem is,\" this being a provocation. If you are a problem-solver and you have\npeople in your life who accept your advice, that is the right spirit for you. If they don't accept your advice, they are not the right spirit for you. The Martian people in the 39 try to insist that others respect their\nadvice. The key to 39 is to continuously provoke. I continue to shock people. It is my design. You have to continue to be what you are. It is just the recognition of the value of these things. Of all people that I\nknow, 39's are the most uncomfortable with the nature of their energy because they do not like the negative results of their provocation. Too bad; this is the only way to learn.\n\n39.1 Disengagement\n\nIt is called Disengagement. The basis of provocation is to back away. This is one of the deepest provocations of all. Think about what that means, genetically. The moment that the 39 disengages, there\nis no mutation.\n\nMars exalted. The determination when confronted by obstacles to withdraw, but only temporarily.\nUnderstand the nature of the foundation. It is looking inward. It is trying to understand what provocation is and, the moment that it provokes, the moment that it is dealing with its capacity to provoke, it always\nends up in situations where that leads to a reaction and they withdraw, but only temporarily. In other words, they will go through it again and again.\n\nThe energy to provoke by refusing to confront obstacles. The obstacle is the resulting provocation in the other. Think about that. When you are provoking somebody, you tease them. What you are teasing is that\nyou need to get exactly the right potential for that teasing. Not everybody will respond in the same way.\n\nPage 2\n\nThose people who will be provoked by that teasing are not for you, but you have to find who is for you.\nThus, you keep on provoking and every time you meet the obstacle, their response to that provocation, you back away and try to find another one.\n\nYou are looking for the spirit. Understand that the 39th gate is a gate that has deep inside of it the only instrument that is out there to look for the spirit. When these human beings stop provoking, we have less\nand less people who are looking for the spirit. For every 39, there is a resonance in the world. The spirit can be found but it is a research, after all.\n\nMercury in detriment. Disengagement, with an accompanying indecision as to when to re engage. There is a good sound biological reason why the foundation for this gate which is seeking to find the spirit for\nmutation, is being held back in this disengagement, because we do not want all kinds of mutations in the world. Just because something is a mutation, it will not inherently guarantee that it is a good mutation. It\ncan be a bad one. A bad mutation is when the 39 provokes someone and they try to stay instead of withdrawing when this person gets provoked. Thus, you will have a negative mutation right away and it\nwill manifest in the quality of that relationship because it then is contentious, caught in the mood swing and the spirit is not there, but only the motor. This is a way of holding back from too many mutations.\n\nThe value of this kind of education is when people who carry the energy of the 39 begin to recognize the value of what that gate is. In order to do so, they all have to develop what I call a thick skin. If you\nprovoke somebody and they get provoked, you know that they are not for you. They will put up an energy vibration that is sent towards you which says, \"This person is a provoker and this person is not nice,\" or\nother gossip told. If people talk about the 39 behind their back or into their face, they do not necessarily like that.\n\nThis is the whole thing about being a 39. That is why there are so few people in the world that are truly looking for the spirit. Most of them are engaged in disengagement. They are pulling back. They provoke,\nthey get the reaction and then pull away. This is what most of the planet is doing with this energy.\n\n39.2 Confrontation\n\nThe second line is always projecting outwards. The 39.2 is projecting outwards that they are provocative and therefore, other people can treat them accordingly and respond, even when they are not provocative.\nWhat happens to these people is that, because everybody responds to that provocation, they end up having to deal with it a lot.\n\nThe second line is called Confrontation. That is what they get. By the way, you can notice that the second, the fourth and the sixth line have the Moon exalted. One of the easiest ways of thinking of the Moon is to\nrecognize that it is what moves and drives us. When the Moon is exalted, this is a very powerful force because we get a constant cycle every 28 days of the Moon coming back to this line and reinforcing this,\nor when it is at the other side of the definition.\n\nHere, The instinctual and direct assault of obstacles. These people are projected on that they are provocative. You are sitting with somebody who is describing to you what the ABC is. The 39.2 is sitting\nthere and does not say a single word, does not stare, does not look funny, does not make any motions, does not do anything, and the person who just described the ABC turns to the 39.2 and says, \"What is the\nmatter with that?\" The 39.2 inside is saying, \"What me?\" and starts stuttering some excuse. What is necessary is the direct assault on the obstacle: \"Nothing. I was not paying any attention to you.\" They get\nthis presumption all the time, this projection that they are ready to be provocative.\n\nPage 3\n\nIn the white book: The energy to provoke through direct assault. These are people that have to deliver this direct assault. They have people coming right at them and say, \"Why are you looking at me so strange?\"\n\"I am not looking at you at all.\" This answer is just as provocative in response. They give the direct assault back.\n\nJupiter in detriment. The principle of preservation that tempts one to go around an obstacle that should be tackled headon. In the white book: An emotional discomfort when direct assault is essential. Think about\nwhat happens to these people. They are so used to being picked on because that is how they feel. They feel like they are being picked on. \"Why do you pick on me? I did not say anything. I did not look at you\nfunny. I did not do anything. Leave me alone.\" The people with the Jupiter in detriment get the direct assault and they do everything in their power to get away from that provocation. They do not go right\nback and say, \"You idiot. Why do you look at me?\" They try to say, \"Really, no, no. Did I look like that?\nI did not mean to. I am really sorry that you thought that I thought that you are funny.\" These people get very angry. The other person will find that answer just as provocative as the direct assault. The 39 never\ngets outside of the game.\n\n39.3 Responsibility\n\nWe come to the completion of the lower trigram, to the trial and error process, to the learning process.\nThis is the resonance to the sixth line and the potential of wisdom. The third line is called Responsibility and here you begin to see the root of what will ultimately be, in the 39.6, the fuel for the 55.6, which will\nlead to the mutation.\n\nThis is the trial and error process of learning to get to this point, and the first thing that we see in this is:\nThe avoidance of confronting obstacles if failure puts others at risk. This 'others at risk' sounds strange because we are dealing with an individual fuel in an individual channel and circuit. Yet, built into it is a\ngenetic recognition of the power of mutation to change everything, either positively or negatively.\n\nWe have Jupiter in detriment. The great benefic whose first consideration is for the larger framework. In the white book: The energy to provoke through self-sacrifice. For example, you have a teacher who is\nbullying the children in the classroom, provoking them, and you have one child who carries this 39.3 energy who will make the sacrifice in order to protect the others. They will go up to that teacher and\nchallenge him. This child will get into trouble, will have to leave the school, will be punished. If this child will not make this self-sacrifice, others will be at risk.\n\nThe responsibility in the third line is this early recognition of the responsibility of being a mutative force.\nThat responsibility is not simply for the individual. Sometimes the provocation has to be for the benefit of others. These are the people in any kind of group situation that do the provoking for others. They,\nthemselves, might well prefer not to get involved because trial and error means mistakes and punishment.\nBut because nobody can, they do, because is built in.\n\nThe Earth in detriment. The often disastrous assumption that others are more at risk if an obstacle is not confronted. The white book: The energy to provoke through the failure to make sacrifices. They do not\nmake the sacrifice and provoke others through that behavior. In the same situation in the classroom, the capacity to provoke on behalf of everyone, but not doing it. This is extremely individual.\n\nThe third line is starting the process of seeing that the individual mutation always has to be ready for sacrifice, always. The moment that you have a mutative force in the world, there are forces that want to\ndestroy it. All individuals, as freaks, are subject to being stoned and, the moment that one is ready to make a mutative provocation for the benefit of others, it becomes the focus of that field of energy.\nSacrifice is built into bringing mutation. There is no mutation without sacrifice.\n\nPage 4\n\n39.4 Temperance\n\nWe come to the fourth line, to the beginning of the upper trigram. It is about being unidirectional; it is about being fixed and one -minded. This fourth line is one of the great lines of the 384 lines. It is such a\ncomplex line. Even the language of this line, its keynotes come from everywhere.\n\nThe fourth line is called Temperance. It sounds very much like the introduction to the 12th hexagram.\nCareful evaluation and assessment before taking action. Before provoking. The nature of the gate is not about doing; it is about provoking.\n\nMoon exalted. The values of feelings and instincts in establishing the proper timing. Feelings have nothing to do with this stream. Instincts have nothing to do with this stream, either. Timing has nothing to\ndo with this stream. We have already looked at the abstract, the tribal and the collective in that one sentence. Three keynotes from three different fields is a very complex energy.\n\nThe values of feelings and instincts in establishing the proper timing. This means: when to provoke.\nUnderstand the beauty of this line. This line is the first time that we can go across the channel. It has the recognition that there is something else on the other side of the channel. The moment that it recognizes\nthe forces on the other side, it says, \"Oh. There is a big emotional motor over there and it is going up and down in a wave. If I don't choose the right time, I will never get the right spirit.\"\n\nIn terms of the white book: The energy to provoke at exactly the right time. This is the magic and the fixation of the fourth line: when is the right time? Because of that, they externalize at different times until\nthey learn. These are the kind of people that only provoke you on Mondays or when you tell them that you have a headache. They find out at what time to provoke you to get a maximum impact, to see whether\nor not you have the right spirit.\n\nThe other side of this energy has the Sun in detriment. The faulty belief that willpower alone can overcome any obstacle regardless of circumstances. 'Willpower': this keynote belongs to the tribal\ncircuitry. You see that this energy is very complex. You have all kinds of keynotes coming from the whole body graph. This whole field is the fuel for mutation. It is not the fuel to initiate mutation. It is not\nthe 3/60. It is the fuel to bring that mutation out into the world and allow it to spread. It is very powerful in that sense.\n\nIn the white book: The energy to provoke that ignores circumstances. This energy does not wait for the right time. These people end up being a pain in the neck because they are always provoking you at the\nwrong time. If it is the right time to provoke somebody when they have a headache, do not provoke them when they do not have one because you will get crushed. You keep on persisting to provoke them\nwhenever you feel like it, instead of recognizing that there is a right time for that.\n\n39.5 Single-mindedness\n\nThe fifth line is always being projected upon, so anybody that carries this fifth line is projected on as being provocative. Due to that projection, they do not have to provoke very much because people get out\nof their way, unless they are really looking for a fight. So, people avoid getting involved at any kind of difficult level with the 39.5 people.\n\nThis line is called Single-mindedness. The rare ability not to overcome but to bypass obstacles. There is no one to be provoked out there, in that sense. They do not get a chance. What happens to these people is\nthat they very rarely find the right spirit. This is a time that we are living in. The 39 provokes to find the\n\nPage 5\n\nspirit. That is its true nature. That is the first line. The fifth line is how everybody else sees it. How everybody else sees it as wrong. What they see is that provocation should not be necessary and it is\nsomething to be avoided. If provocation is avoided, no spirit can be found. These people are projected on that they are single-minded, that they are the ones that can get it done. They do not run into any problems\nbecause they do not get the constant provocation because other people are very aware of this capacity in them.\n\nNeptune exalted. The imagination to establish new patterns that make the obstacles irrelevant. The moment that the obstacles are irrelevant, the spirit is gone. Think about that. The moment that it is\nprojected on you that you are provocative, so \"let's not provoke them,\" there is no chance to find the spirit. But this is what the totality wants out of that fifth line. This is their projection on what this fuel is\nall about.\n\nThe Mars in detriment. Simple hardheadedness. Though less exalted, it can often result in success and gather support by its very determination. It is amazing how many people are mutated by these 39.5's\nbecause, rather than going through the provocation with them, they just accept whatever it is in the mood, and they can often pull people along with them, but the spirit is missing. This is the whole thing. It is so\nimportant that when you are working with people that have the 39th gate, that they truly understand what provocation is for. It is there to find the right spirit. The right spirit is the spirit that is not provoked. You\ncan cheat by doing the fifth line number. The fifth line number is, \"Let's see. There does not seem to be any provocation out there, so everything is okay\" It does not work that way.\n\nIn our evolutionary process, we are slowly moving towards the sixth line. We are actually in the fifth line phase which is the great projected phase. So, we have the most complex Maya now that the planet has\never had. We have an enormous projected Maya around us. That is the density of the fifth line.\nEverything about our world is about projection now, our concepts about each other, the universe, and god.\nAll of that is part of a vast projection field and all of that is through the fifth line, universalization, because we are all living this global village consciousness. It is part of the process to go through this fifth\nline phase so we can complete all of that because the spirit comes afterwards. It can't come now. It does not exist now.\n\n39.6 The Troubleshooter\n\nThe Troubleshooter is an American Western term. They used to have these characters that could take you across the country in carriages. The person who was sitting beside the driver was called the\ntroubleshooter. If any trouble came along, this person would shoot it. This is where the word 'troubleshooter' comes from.\n\nLike all sixth lines, we have a transition field here. It goes beyond the nature of the hexagram and looks for much more. What the 39.6 is looking at is, \"Can we get this mutation into the world and, once it is in\nthe world, will it be of value to humanity?' That is its process. You can see what the beauty of provocation is, at its highest level. Provocation, at its highest level, is nothing more than the capacity to\ngo to somebody else and provide them, empower them, with mutation. \"I know what is wrong with your life.\" \"Get out of my face,\" is the answer of a lot of people who do not like anybody coming up to them to\ntell them what their problem is. \"Can I help you with this? Can I show you how to do this?\"\n\nNothing is more provocative in this life than somebody coming up to you and telling you what is wrong with you, and that they will fix it. Due to the nature of sixth lines, most of these troubleshooters never\nlook for trouble and do not shoot. They just hope that the riot will be very quiet and everything will be okay. Their inherent gift is this capacity of penetrating to the core of what somebody's dilemma is. Not\n\nPage 6\n\ntheir own. Recognize how altruistic and special that is. Mutation is for the whole specie and never for the individuals. It is for the whole specie. Otherwise, it is of no value.\n\nSo, the ultimate field here is as it says in the white book: The energy to provoke others by attempting to solve their problems. The 39 is provoking to find the right spirit. So, anybody who is going to listen to\nthese very gifted people is the right spirit. To be able to offer this mutation is a very gifted fuel: those people take the mutation and move it along.\n\nIn the black book it says: The natural gift for solving problems. It is a gift. What that ultimately means is that the final stage in our process, this mutation, will solve our problems. To get rid of these bodies is one\nway to solve our problems. It is just about changing the equipment. But nonetheless, you get to the point that you have problem-solving. What you will also have is when the 39 really has this capacity and when\nwe get to the stage where the mutation takes place, it is a natural gift that will be accepted by others because they are a very important mutative force.\n\nMoon exalted. Practicality and the ability to guide and nurture others. These people get blown off so fast.\nIn our work together, we are dealing with our adult consciousness, but you start your life with your design. If you have a 39.6 child and it says to you, \"I don't think that you know what you are doing in the\nkitchen,\" or \"You don't know how to run the computer,\" think about what happens to this 39.6 child. They have a natural gift for solving problems but it is provocative and they get rejected a lot for that\nprovocation. That puts them in a bad mood because we are dealing with a mood gate and they feel terrible and then they say, \"I don't care. I won't help them or tell them what is wrong. They will give me a hard\ntime. They will not do that.\" Always remember that when you are looking at any line, think about it first as a child's line before you think about it as an adult line. You get to see that so much of what is there in\nthe beginning is already deeply conditioned by the forces around it and so few of these aspects get a chance to flourish because of that.\n\nAll 39 children know what that is like. That provocation always was in them. They already provoked you as a baby. Some of these babies get thrown against walls. Recognize that you start your life with your\ndesign and see it in that perspective, and then you begin to understand what it may or may not be like. In most cases, 39.6's do not provoke anything. It is rare. It has to do with the spirit that is available. If there\nis the right spirit, there is the opportunity for them to always release their wisdom. All sixth lines carry the potential of wisdom. They can release the wisdom of what the problem is and how to solve that problem.\nRemember that it is a genetic gift. There is no awareness here. It is simply the capacity in that fuel to deal with any dilemma and to be able to mutate it.\n\nOn the other side: The emotional drive to dominate that provokes others. In the black book we have Mars in detriment. Ego dominance that generally abuses this gift for self-aggrandizement and personal ambition\nrather than for the benefit of others. It is so difficult for these people when they are growing up because they can't solve problems if they go the other way. They insist for the rest of their lives that they are the\nonly ones in the world that can solve any problem and that others had better pay attention to them or nothing is going to happen. Both of those stances are not provoking at all when it is obvious that it is\nthere because we take in each other's auras. Or provoking insistently and again, remember that most of the time, the potential of the sixth line does not come out because it has already been held back in the youth.\nThere will be exceptions.\n\nWhen we have the transition that is going to take place, when this movement takes place and this begins to open up, these people will really be of value in society. It will be a time for them when they will\nflourish because their gifts are essential to maintain the spirit field. The individual stream maintains it.\n\nPage 7\n\nRemember that the 39 is coming out of the root center. The Troubleshooters are under enormous pressure to solve problems. They have no other way. That is their nature and they have to recognize when not to\nprovoke. \"If I can't solve your problems, I will stop eating.\" We have people who do that all the time.\nThat is the ultimate 39.6 provocation. \"You do not treat us well in our independence movement, so will we all stop eating.\" Or the other way around: people who can't solve the problem and get fat.\n\nPage 8",

Nobody is allowed to come and visit you. Nobody is allowed to disturb you. You are in\nyour nice apartment building on the 39th floor and, all of a sudden, you hear a fire alarm while you are lying there on your sofa during your ritualized, fixed time.

This is the irony of these things.\n\nThe power to maintain one's own rhythm; or Weakness in maintaining one's rhythm when challenged.\nThat is why Mars is so powerful in the exalted. Understand the basis of what this hexagram is saying; it is so important. No logical process can be a success without a fixed rhythm. You can't just study 24 hours\nand then go and pass an exam. If you study 20 minutes a day for two weeks, you might. You have to establish the proper rhythm and fix what works for you. This is what logic demands and it is also what\nleadership demands: rituals. Wte have flags and people who salute. We have all these rituals of state. Wte need all these fixed rituals; otherwise, the understanding process does not work.\n\nPage 1"

If they are running\naround like mad and they cannot stop running around, they are convinced that it is a mistake because they are sure that they should be on vacation somewhere, lying flat on their back and doing nothing.

(I hate the word 'therapy; I'd rather say 'methodology'.) In those moments, where they assume that their fixed rhythm is not correct, that it is a\nmistake. I always tell them the same thing, \"Well, imagine what it would be like to do something else.\"\nThis can be deeply imaginative. There is a great power in this: while they are flat on their back, they can dream, or while they are running around being busy, they can dream about another fixed rhythm. It is\nbetter for them to imagine the vacation while they are running around instead of taking it. Better for them to imagine being busy when they are lying down instead of doing it. That is much healthier for them.\n\nUnderstand that logic requires an enormous amount of imagination. Logic, after all, is rooted in the talent process. Without imagination logic can never work. So much of the logic that we process in our lives, we\nprocess at the imaginative level, making imaginative constructs in our mind to see within our imagination whether logic resonates for us, or not.\n\nThis is an opportunity for these people, in that moment of seeing that their rhythm is not correct for them or is a mistake, to allow that simply to work out. It is the rhythm. Don't change it, but go in your\nimagination to wherever you want to go. This is the healthy side of this process.\n\nUnderneath is: Unable to surrender and at odds with one's own rhythm.

Here you\nhave what is called The Hunter. Waiting as a guarantee of survival. Having your natural rhythm or fixing your natural rhythm is a guarantee of survival. There are very few guarantees in this life. Here is one. The\nguarantee is that if you live by your fixed rhythm, your natural fixed rhythm, it is a guarantee for survival.\n\nUranus exalted. The creative genius to transform the most passive experience into active achievement.\nThis goes back to something very basic about understanding how wonderful our form is. It goes back to the fact that we don't have to do anything. It is built in. This is genetics, after all. If you are not struggling\nwith your own rhythm, not trying to change it, not succumbing to group pressure, this is the opportunity for a deep creative process to really see what comes out of you in your natural rhythm because it is you.\nOut of that natural rhythm comes the pure logical process that belongs to you and it is a guarantee that you will survive, and not because of somebody else.\n\nSun in detriment. The vanity of a personality so strong that, unwilling to hide behind a blind, threatens its very survival. This is the other side of the captain that goes down with the ship. This is just cuffing your\nlosses and off you go. Remember that this line knows that there is another side. This is not the love of the body; this is the love of humanity. \"I need to serve humanity,\" The fourth, fifth and sixth lines of the 5th\nhexagram are there to serve humanity. In that externalization in the fourth line, you have this fixed process where it says, \"I don't want to wait. I want to serve humanity now. I don't want to accept this\nrhythm.\" The moment that they don't accept that rhythm, their very survival is threatened. There are so\n\nPage 3\n\nmany people who, out of impatience and pressure, will break their natural rhythm and try to live another rhythm and become very ill. They become unhealthy because it is not for them.\n\nIllness has its manifestation in many ways. It is not just simply chronic obvious illness. It is deeper:\npsychological things and all kinds of emotional damage that can be done to them and the crushing of the ego. All of that has a root in this line. One of the things to recognize about the fourth line is that it really\nneeds to be able to express that fixed rhythm as a contribution to the totality, as a contribution to humanity.\n\nThe Hunter, in the white book: The power to make the best of one's fixed rhythm. This is the genius. On the other side: The drive to deny one's own rhythm with predictable costs. If you go against your own\nrhythm, you will pay a price. Always. By the way, my advice or information for these people with this detriment is: they must make sure that there is nobody around them who is trying to pull them away from\ntheir rhythm because they will succumb. Mechanics protects you by giving you a way to work with that mechanical information.\n\nIf you have an aspect that can bring you into a detrimental field which is not healthy for you, you have to make sure that there are not those forces around you that will automatically do that. If you have the 21.3\nand you are powerless with superior forces, then don't work for superior forces because you will be powerless. If you don't want to be pulled away from your fixed rhythm, because that tendency is always\nin you if you have this detriment, don't allow anybody to do that. Don't allow people around you who do not accept your rhythm. Mechanics is a great teacher that way."

      "heading": "Joy",
      "raw": "I love this line. It is a lot of fun for me. V know what the fifth line is all about. Wye know that this is universalization and we know that everyone who carries the fifth line is going to be projected on.\nEverything about the logic process is about the repetitive process. To repeat over and over again in your fixed rhythm, concentrated in order to produce out of that a corrective process to eventually, through\nexperimentation, come to a point where after many years, mastery is the result. In the second line, we had a projected field of inner peace going out and when we get to the fifth line, we have a projected field\ngoing onto the fifth line person and that projected field is called Joy.\n\nIt says: Waiting as an aspect of enlightenment. There are only two out of the 384 lines that mention the word enlightenment: the 54.4 which is Enlightenment/Endarkenment, which is another thing entirely, but\nhere we have the aspect that we call enlightenment. Please understand something: enlightenment is a projection of those from the outside onto somebody else. Please understand that. Be very clear about that.\nBe very clear about something else, too: when Pluto comes roaring through into this fifth line and it hits the detriment, we are going to have a collapsing of this concept of enlightenment in terms of the nature of\nthe so-called Master. Please understand that enlightenment is a projection. It is the outside turning on the light and focusing it on somebody else and projecting that light onto them. They may or may not be the\nmaster of what is being projected onto them, but it can look like that.\n\nWaiting as an aspect of enlightenment. What they are projecting onto these people is that they have this fixed rhythm and, because of that, they seem so calm. The apartment building is burning down and you\nare lying there on the sofa and somebody comes racing in and says, \"Don't you hear all these fire alarms?\nThis place is burning down,\" and you look at them very calmly and you say, \"Please, don't disturb me. I am having my rest. Close the door, will you?\" Do you know what that does to your reputation later? They\nsay, \"That was unbelievable. This one really knew.\"\n\nPage 4\n\nTo remain calm as the ultimate aesthetic... This is about beauty. This is not about truth.. ..and thus recognize the inner meaning of being. And when you get to that point you should get the joke: Pluto in\ndetriment. Joy dismissed as an illusion, waiting as a failure. We will have a huge generation of children born with this line. Millions and millions of them will be born in the beginning of this new century\ncarrying something that has not been in humanity for 156 years, bringing this energy out. It is the beginning of what people call the movement towards Aquarian knowledge, that projection is not enough.\nAfter all, this is all about logic.\n\nIn the white book: The power to be calm and to find one's place in the flow, or Disillusionment with recognizing one's place in the flow. Remember, because it is projected on these people that they are calm\nand at peace within themselves or enlightened, they'd better not make any mistakes.\n\nI have friends in America who are hosts for me when I tour there. They are guru chasers, so they get a lot of masters that come by and stay in their house because that is what they like. The stories that they tell:\nsomebody who has that projected field on them and you bring them into your own home and then you realize, \"Oh, my god. What is this?\" Everyone who plays the spiritual master game knows that it is the\nprojection coming from the outside and there is this deep fear inside of them, whether they can live up to the standard. The key is: you'd better be calm inside. I love this line."

      "heading": "Yielding",
      "raw": "When we get to the sixth line, we find a very unusual sixth line here because it has no polarity. We only have exaltation, so it is being fixed in a very special way. It is called Yielding. Waiting is never free from\npressure, physical or mental, and is often punctuated by the unexpected. This takes us back to the irony of logical energy: that it is suffused with faith and belief. There is all this faith built in underneath because\nnobody really knows whether the solution can ever be achieved and whether the leadership can ever take place.\n\nIt says that 'waiting is never free from pressure' and that it 'is often punctuated by the unexpected'. The unexpected is illogical. This can be very disturbing sometimes. \"I was doing step one, two, three, four,\nand all of a sudden something happened, something out of context.\" That 'out of context' allows for the unfolding of the whole process. There is always this sense inside, and this makes logical people even\nmore determined to find out why the unexpected happened, so that they can make sure that it always fits into logic. It is like people who talk about coincidences instead of recognizing geometries. The geometry\nis clear: you know that these things are meeting each other.\n\nAccepting that in one's fixed rhythm despite the pressures, growth will be empowered, and often through the unexpected. Built into it is that through the fixed rhythm there will be growth, but, Neptune exalted.\nThe growth of awareness that comes with bending to the universal flow. It is still a sixth line. It does not really mean that they are going to give their energy to humanity. They can, but that does not mean that\nthey will. Again, they are looking at the whole circuit which means that this line is looking to the 31st gate at the end that says \"I lead with this formula that we have experimented with and proven. It is a value\nfor us and reliable in the future.\"\n\nYou don't know that in the fifth gate. You can't because it is just an energy. It has no identity. It knows that there is much more and because of that, it does not want to give its energy to anything that it cannot\nlead. That is a key for it. In other words, \"Will I be really able to take this energy and go down this road.\nCan I actually do it?\"\n\nThese are people that are pulled into the flow unexpectedly. They can be standing on the sideline watching the river flow and everything is fine and all of a sudden a boat goes by and catches them.\n\nPage 5\n\nUnexpectedly, they find themselves in the flow. The logic process: they would love to kidnap all these people that have these energy gates for logic and hold on to them and keep them in the cupboard\nsomewhere, so that they can really activate this logical process. It is very hard for the 5.6 to escape the demands of society. Society comes along and says, \"Excuse me. I know that you do not want to get\ninvolved but we will take you along with us.\"\n\nWhen you look at the logical process, you see that it does not involve the ego. There is no ego in logic.\nWhen you get to this sixth line, you get to this uncertainty about whether one can really lead or whether one can really go through this logical process and get to the solution and be able to do something about it.\nThe very next hexagram, the very first line is the 26.1, which is tribal. It says: A bird in the hand. The ego has a lesson for logic: be satisfied with what it is that you have and, by the way, if you can't be satisfied\nabout it, lie.\n\nPage 6"

If you discover that every day at four o'clock\nyou like to have a siesta and you need that hour of rest because it is important for you, when you recognize that it is an important rhythm in your life, fix it and make it a habit, a ritual.\" Concentration\nneeds the proper patterns to work through. The moment you realize that this is your ritual, a natural rhythm for you, you are using your energy properly.\n\nIt is so important for 5's to be ritualistic, to recognize their natural rhythms and to fix them. In this form of waiting, fixing your natural rhythm is an active state of awareness. It is not awareness but a state.

One of the things to recognize about the fourth line is that it really\nneeds to be able to express that fixed rhythm as a contribution to the totality, as a contribution to humanity.\n\nThe Hunter, in the white book: The power to make the best of one's fixed rhythm. This is the genius. On the other side: The drive to deny one's own rhythm with predictable costs. If you go against your own\nrhythm, you will pay a price. Always. By the way, my advice or information for these people with this detriment is: they must make sure that there is nobody around them who is trying to pull them away from\ntheir rhythm because they will succumb. Mechanics protects you by giving you a way to work with that mechanical information.\n\nIf you have an aspect that can bring you into a detrimental field which is not healthy for you, you have to make sure that there are not those forces around you that will automatically do that. If you have the 21.3\nand you are powerless with superior forces, then don't work for superior forces because you will be powerless. If you don't want to be pulled away from your fixed rhythm, because that tendency is always\nin you if you have this detriment, don't allow anybody to do that. Don't allow people around you who do not accept your rhythm. Mechanics is a great teacher that way.\n\n5.5 Joy\n\nI love this line. It is a lot of fun for me. V know what the fifth line is all about. Wye know that this is universalization and we know that everyone who carries the fifth line is going to be projected on.\nEverything about the logic process is about the repetitive process. To repeat over and over again in your fixed rhythm, concentrated in order to produce out of that a corrective process to eventually, through\nexperimentation, come to a point where after many years, mastery is the result. In the second line, we had a projected field of inner peace going out and when we get to the fifth line, we have a projected field\ngoing onto the fifth line person and that projected field is called Joy.\n\nIt says: Waiting as an aspect of enlightenment. There are only two out of the 384 lines that mention the word enlightenment: the 54.4 which is Enlightenment/Endarkenment, which is another thing entirely, but\nhere we have the aspect that we call enlightenment. Please understand something: enlightenment is a projection of those from the outside onto somebody else. Please understand that. Be very clear about that.\nBe very clear about something else, too: when Pluto comes roaring through into this fifth line and it hits the detriment, we are going to have a collapsing of this concept of enlightenment in terms of the nature of\nthe so-called Master. Please understand that enlightenment is a projection. It is the outside turning on the light and focusing it on somebody else and projecting that light onto them. They may or may not be the\nmaster of what is being projected onto them, but it can look like that.\n\nWaiting as an aspect of enlightenment. What they are projecting onto these people is that they have this fixed rhythm and, because of that, they seem so calm. The apartment building is burning down and you\nare lying there on the sofa and somebody comes racing in and says, \"Don't you hear all these fire alarms?\nThis place is burning down,\" and you look at them very calmly and you say, \"Please, don't disturb me. I am having my rest. Close the door, will you?\" Do you know what that does to your reputation later? They\nsay, \"That was unbelievable. This one really knew.\"\n\nPage 4\n\nTo remain calm as the ultimate aesthetic... This is about beauty. This is not about truth.. ..and thus recognize the inner meaning of being. And when you get to that point you should get the joke: Pluto in\ndetriment. Joy dismissed as an illusion, waiting as a failure. We will have a huge generation of children born with this line. Millions and millions of them will be born in the beginning of this new century\ncarrying something that has not been in humanity for 156 years, bringing this energy out. It is the beginning of what people call the movement towards Aquarian knowledge, that projection is not enough.\nAfter all, this is all about logic.\n\nIn the white book: The power to be calm and to find one's place in the flow, or Disillusionment with recognizing one's place in the flow. Remember, because it is projected on these people that they are calm\nand at peace within themselves or enlightened, they'd better not make any mistakes.\n\nI have friends in America who are hosts for me when I tour there. They are guru chasers, so they get a lot of masters that come by and stay in their house because that is what they like. The stories that they tell:\nsomebody who has that projected field on them and you bring them into your own home and then you realize, \"Oh, my god. What is this?\" Everyone who plays the spiritual master game knows that it is the\nprojection coming from the outside and there is this deep fear inside of them, whether they can live up to the standard. The key is: you'd better be calm inside. I love this line.\n\n5.6 Yielding\n\nWhen we get to the sixth line, we find a very unusual sixth line here because it has no polarity. We only have exaltation, so it is being fixed in a very special way. It is called Yielding. Waiting is never free from\npressure, physical or mental, and is often punctuated by the unexpected. This takes us back to the irony of logical energy: that it is suffused with faith and belief. There is all this faith built in underneath because\nnobody really knows whether the solution can ever be achieved and whether the leadership can ever take place.\n\nIt says that 'waiting is never free from pressure' and that it 'is often punctuated by the unexpected'. The unexpected is illogical. This can be very disturbing sometimes. \"I was doing step one, two, three, four,\nand all of a sudden something happened, something out of context.\" That 'out of context' allows for the unfolding of the whole process. There is always this sense inside, and this makes logical people even\nmore determined to find out why the unexpected happened, so that they can make sure that it always fits into logic. It is like people who talk about coincidences instead of recognizing geometries. The geometry\nis clear: you know that these things are meeting each other.\n\nAccepting that in one's fixed rhythm despite the pressures, growth will be empowered, and often through the unexpected. Built into it is that through the fixed rhythm there will be growth, but, Neptune exalted.\nThe growth of awareness that comes with bending to the universal flow. It is still a sixth line. It does not really mean that they are going to give their energy to humanity. They can, but that does not mean that\nthey will. Again, they are looking at the whole circuit which means that this line is looking to the 31st gate at the end that says \"I lead with this formula that we have experimented with and proven. It is a value\nfor us and reliable in the future.\"\n\nYou don't know that in the fifth gate. You can't because it is just an energy. It has no identity. It knows that there is much more and because of that, it does not want to give its energy to anything that it cannot\nlead. That is a key for it. In other words, \"Will I be really able to take this energy and go down this road.\nCan I actually do it?\"\n\nThese are people that are pulled into the flow unexpectedly. They can be standing on the sideline watching the river flow and everything is fine and all of a sudden a boat goes by and catches them.\n\nPage 5\n\nUnexpectedly, they find themselves in the flow. The logic process: they would love to kidnap all these people that have these energy gates for logic and hold on to them and keep them in the cupboard\nsomewhere, so that they can really activate this logical process. It is very hard for the 5.6 to escape the demands of society. Society comes along and says, \"Excuse me. I know that you do not want to get\ninvolved but we will take you along with us.\"\n\nWhen you look at the logical process, you see that it does not involve the ego. There is no ego in logic.\nWhen you get to this sixth line, you get to this uncertainty about whether one can really lead or whether one can really go through this logical process and get to the solution and be able to do something about it.\nThe very next hexagram, the very first line is the 26.1, which is tribal. It says: A bird in the hand. The ego has a lesson for logic: be satisfied with what it is that you have and, by the way, if you can't be satisfied\nabout it, lie.\n\nPage 6",

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 1 THE CREATIVE\n\nThe first and second hexagrams are essentially the same. That is, the first hexagram remains closest in spirit to the direction of the second hexagram because there is neither projection nor reflection. There is\nsimply the spontaneous release of direction as the expression of self. Here in the first gate we are dealing with a role gate. We have six role gates: two of them in the sacral center and four of them in the G. Three\nof the four gates in the G are part of the cross of the Sphinx. The 10th gate is part of the Vessel of Love.\n\nWhenever you see a role gate in somebody's design, you know right away that this is something that dominates as a theme for them, to live out the essence or the nature of that role. The role that is inherent\nin the first hexagram is to express uniqueness. In the crudest language, it is simply to express mutation.\nBy expressing uniqueness and mutation, we are speaking of the same thing. This is the difference that is always possible in the individual.\n\nIn the first hexagram, like in the second, we have the repetition above the line of this term, \"primal\".\nThese are primal forces. They divide the yin and yang of the wheel: the six yin lines in The Receptive (Hexagram 2) and the six yang lines in The Creative.\n\nCreation as a primal force. We have receptivity as a primal base and creation as a primal force. The energy potential to manifest inspiration without limitation. 'Potential' is a keyword because so many\nthings are going to be necessary. To manifest inspiration without limitation' is a very important term to grasp. Mutation knows no boundary. Mutation follows on structure and order. Mutation is something that\nsimply jumps. Remember, everything that has to do with the 1 and the 2 is all rooted in this center: tantric movement in that we have this pulsing of the individual process, the mutative pulse, the on and the off.\n\nThe most important thing for anybody who carries the first gate is the recognition that the first gate does not have to be best. To be best is collective. When there is nothing new, everybody is competing to see\nwho can be best. But when there is something new, no best exists. It is just new. Individuality always brings what is new and as such it cannot lead, it cannot project, it cannot be the witness, and it cannot\nreflect. It can only live out that nature. That is why, with energy, the potential to manifest inspiration is unlimited because the mutation transcends or can transcend limitation.\n\n1.1 Creation is independent of will\n\nThe first line always speaks for the nature of the hexagram. Here we have the relationship between the self and the ego. The first thing we hear is that Creation is independent of will. Right away you have this\nkeynote that says: look, this is not about what your ego is doing. This is not about your ego claiming that it is a creative font. The ego is just a motor. Unique direction is not about willpower: \"I'll do something\nnobody else has ever done.\" Only somebody collective can say something dumb like that because to do something that nobody else has ever done is a mutation and it can only happen. We cannot create it. It is\nindependent of will.\n\nThe Moon exalted as the symbol of adaptation. Time is everything. This is so important to understand about mutation. It follows its own law. You have to wait for it and there is nothing that you can do.\nRemember that this is a first line. It is not transpersonal. It does not know that there is an 8th gate on the other side that is ready to make a contribution. It does not know that it can make that contribution. There\nis just this deep impulse to express one's uniqueness. Time is everything.\n\nUranus in detriment. Instability leads to distortion. Here, patience is a virtue and revolution a vice. In the white book, the Uranus in detriment is: Creative instability unless there is patience. That is much more\n\nPage 1\n\nclearly stated there. In other words, you can't be an example right away. So many individuals go through life trying to be like the collective until that moment of mutation. You have to be patient. If you are, it\nwill come. The moment you try to control it, the moment you try to drive it with willpower, then you become unstable.\n\nI have been creative all of my life. Every time my big ego tried to tell me that it was time to create, I would end up with enormous frustration. In those moments where the last thing on earth I want to do is to\ncreate anything, I will be driven to do it because that is the mechanism. You learn in time. Patience is a great teacher. Revolution, the desire out of the ego to express creativity, and to do it when you want to do\nit, leads to distortion. I have my South Node there. Time is everything. I had to wait nearly 40 years.\n\n1.2 Love is light\n\nWith individuality, we are dealing with a number of things. First of all, we are dealing with people that are not designed to be interfered with. In individual gates, you do not allow anybody to interfere. We are\nin the lower trigram here, so the individual here does not even expect that there is somebody that is going to interfere.\n\nThe other thing is that all individuality suffers from the chemistry of melancholy. All individuality is rooted in a happy and a sad cycle. Unique, individual expression or mutation is not something that\nhappens all the time, every day. There is a process built into the foundation that says that this is something that has to be waited for and, in waiting, there can be a great deal of turmoil.\n\nWhen you come to the second line, it is very much involved in itself and in being what it is: being different. Somebody looks inside and sees that difference. In seeing it, the second line can be interfered\nwith and brought out of their individual process.\n\nHere we have Love is light. What a lovely line. Venus exalted as a symbol of beauty. Remember, so much about direction has to do with beauty. There is a joke in this. Everybody knows that beauty is in the\neye of the beholder. One person's rose is another person's cow-pie. That is the way things are. So we have this subjectivity that we are all looking for. What is beauty? What is the beautiful way? What appears to\nbe the beautiful way for some is not necessarily the way for others.\n\nThe required harmony between established values and ideals that enriches inspiration. The established value is simply to be oneself without interference and to fulfill one's life. The ideal is to maintain that\ncapacity for individual expression. However, the 1.2's don't know that like the naturals in the 2.2. They just live that until somebody interferes because that will always happen to them.\n\nOn the other side, the Mars side, again we have the presence of the ego force trying to step in. Desires and passions have their place but not at the expense of Creation. In other words, desire and passion have their\nplace. Save desire and passion for your lover or for whatever it is, but to desire to be unique or to put all your passion in being unique is misplaced and always moody.\n\nIn the white book: Self expression conditioned by ideals and values; or Self expression limited by desires and passions. In both cases, please understand something: the way in which this line will work is deeply\nconnected to who this being will meet in their life because there are those people that will deeply interfere with that process. After all, this is a very powerful force. It is a penetrating force. There are those people\nthat love to take that penetrating force and manifest it, bring it out. The second line, because it does not know that it is unique, is subject to being cranked up, to being pumped up, to having the ego built up:\n\"You are really unique. You are really terrific. You have to put your desire and passion to this.\" They are\n\nPage 2\n\nbeing interfered with instead of being left alone inside their lit room. Whenever you are dealing with individuality, the more you let these people alone and do not interfere, the better it is going to be.\n\nLook at your own design, at any individual gate or channel you have. That is the, one place in your life where nobody has a right to interfere. The moment you let them interfere, a very important quality of\nwhat you are as a being gets lost. Individuality is not here to be interfered with. The collective is about sharing. Individuality is about ultimate empowerment.\n\n1.3 The energy to sustain creative work\n\nIf you were a bookmaker and you were doing some gambling on who was going to be a mutative success and you had all the examples of the first gate and the various lines, the first thing to recognize is that there\nis a joke. The second and the fifth line normally are lines that can be very successful: the second because its quality is seen by others and therefore it is recognized, and the fifth because others will always project\nthe best possibilities onto the fifth, at least at the beginning. Under normal circumstances one would think that the second and the fifth line of the first hexagram would in fact be the ones that are the most\nmutative. It is not true. They are deeply handicapped because they, more than any of the other lines, bring interference into their lives. If you are going to make a bet, you can bet on the first, third and fourth. Sixth\nlines, we never know. In the first, third or fourth, there is always the possibility for mutation because they are much better equipped to keep the outside from interfering.\n\nThe third line is called: The energy to sustain creative work. Mars exalted as the symbol of a profound need for self-expression. Because what happens to these people is the trial and error process and because\nthey do not know what is on the other side, they learn about interference. Because they have the capacity to adapt, they can learn from that interference. They have the Martian energy to keep pushing through and\nthey will not let the interference get in the way. This is the first side.\n\nWhen you come to the other side, to the Earth in detriment: Material forces can disrupt creativity and lead to overambition. These are people who are actually very talented and who never get to fulfill the potential\nof their real talent because they get pulled into commercial possibilities, i.e. somebody who is struggling to be a legitimate painter who needs money, gets a job as a graphic artist and ends up being caught up in\nthe world buying televisions, cars, mortgages, vacations and so on, and sells out their uniqueness to the mundane plane. This is the other side. Material forces can disrupt creativity and lead to over-ambition.\n\nSo, in the third line, the exalted side can get past the interference even though it meets it and, in meeting it, it learns a lot because it learns to recognize what happens to its creative process when it is interfered\nwith. Because of the Martian quality, it can keep on moving through. But on the other side, materialism disrupts creativity. The moment that you give a young painter 100 dollars for a canvas, you\ninstantaneously change the way they produce their art because the materialism, if they have the detriment, is just going to pull them away from continuing their unique mutative process.\n\nOne of the most common scenarios in our V*stern world is to have so many young, creative people that have been totally fucked up by money. It is amazing how many careers have been destroyed by easy\nmoney. Whether we talk about artists, actors or rock n' roll stars. This is part of the theme of direction, to wait for the right timing.\n\nThe second and the third lines have similar problems in dealing with the outside, but the third is better equipped because it can adapt. The lower trigram in and of itself has a great deal of difficulty with trying\nto keep interference away. By the way, there is such a thing as positive interference. This is not to say that all interference is negative, like what the third line learns from being interfered with. There is a Chinese\nsaying: good news, bad news, who knows? The person that interferes with you may turn you onto a\n\nPage 3\n\ndifferent track where mutation can take place. We have strange allies in life but interference is the main theme here.\n\n1.4 Aloneness as the medium of creativity\n\nWhen we come to the upper trigram, we come to a very special fourth line. The fourth line has a harmony to the first line and what we learned in the first line is that creation is independent of will, not only the\nwill of the artist but the will of others and their interference as well. Here we have the transpersonal harmony to that. In other words, what you have in the fourth line is the recognition that there is an 8th\ngate at the other end and that the contribution can be made. The recognition of what is on the other side, something very deep, is at work here.\n\nThis line is called: Aloneness as the medium of creativity, not 'interference as the medium of creativity'.\nThe fourth line will externalize that in a one-tracked way. Fourth lines can be so very successful and can bring mutation into the world because they are one-tracked in recognizing the value of aloneness. The line\nsays: aloneness as the medium of creativity, not as the medium for contribution, just for the creativity. It is clear that when one has to be creative, one needs to be alone. That does not mean that one has to be\nalone one's entire life. It means that only the creativity can not be interfered with.\n\nThe tension of inner light. That is the overview. Think about what the real creative process is. The real creative process is to build that tension over a life-time. It is an inner tension because the creative process\nrequires tension and because you have to wait for those moments in which the mutation really works.\n\nThe Earth exalted as a symbol of a personal perspective manifested outside of influence. Jupiter in detriment. Where the potential magic of inspiration is diluted. This is a very bizarre line because as far as\nI can tell, there are only two lines in the whole book, 1.4 and 1.6, where you have Jupiter in detriment and there is no explanation given. Nothing.\n\nThe first thing to realize in the aloneness: creativity must develop outside of influence. What happens in the detriment is not that these people give up the aloneness for their creativity, what happens is that once\nthey have the mutation, they become fixed on externalizing it and they give up further possibilities of mutation. An example: let's say there is somebody who has written something and it is really good and\nthey want to get it out in the world. They will stop writing and they will spend their time, their creative energy, trying to get somebody to recognize it and to be very fixed on getting it out into the world. Or\nthey write other books following the same recipe, the same theme, endlessly.\n\nIn the white book there is an explanation of it: The need to influence that abandons aloneness and limits creativity. Please understand, it does not mean that they are different than the exalted in terms of not\nallowing people to influence them. They don't. They end up getting influenced in trying to bring out into the world what they have, not the creativity itself. They get caught up in marketing, in trying to get things\nout and they lose their creative feel. In order for them to get back to their creativity they have to go back into their aloneness.\n\n1.5 The energy to attract society\n\nThis is one of these fifth lines that are very difficult, as I mentioned earlier. Here you have the projection that is coming from everyone: this is the talented one. The moment that there is this constant projection,\nthere is all kinds of interference. \"You are so talented. Why don't you do something?\" Fifth lines always present this possibility. In other words, fifth lines can be an enormous advantage in life. If you look at\nyour own fifth lines, you realize that this is where people are projecting on you. You will always get the positive projection before you get the negative. That is true of all fifth lines. Everybody looks at a fifth\n\nPage 4\n\nline and is hoping for the best out of that fifth line. When they get disappointed, then they project the other way but you are always given the benefit with a fifth line.\n\nIn the fifth line of the first hexagram, this assumption that one is creative is very attractive to society.\nSociety likes to know that there are those creative, mutative forces around. It is not necessarily conducive to creativity because it is always pulling interference.\n\nMars exalted for its powerful ego endurance. The only thing that is left in the fifth line is that everybody is coming to the fifth line saying, \"You have such talent\" and they end up just riding this ego field. When\nyou see these people you see them on television, on game shows. These are the kind of people that did something once, long ago, that everybody at the time projected was really talented and they never did a\nbloody thing ever again, but they made a living of being considered creative ever since. Television is full of these people. Life is too, by the way.\n\nThe other side is the Uranus in detriment, where eccentricity can handicap endurance. This is the example of Oscar Wilde. He did not give his energy to his talent, but to his life. (The actual quote is: \"I gave my\ntalent to my life, not my art.\") We are dealing with a freak circuit here. We are dealing with individuality; we are dealing with the outsider and what happens to these people is that they try to just live what the\noutside world wants, which is to be like a creative person. Society has created the illusion of what a creative person is. Usually they are poor drunks or have terrible problems with women, beat their\nchildren, steal money or take drugs but do manage to produce every once in a while things of beauty that everyone appreciates. If you do not really have the depth or the skills, you can still play the role. It is a\nrole gate, after all.\n\nThese people with the 1 .5 in detriment are out there playing the creative role and everybody is accepting that, except that they get more and more eccentric to get the attention. All individuality is seeking\nattention. The more eccentric they become, the sooner the whole game will crash. Then they are famous has-beens. They used to be creative; they are not anymore. The endurance is that they put up with the\ninterference. They have no choice. They attract society. They can be very valuable in the sense that, because they attract society, they can get mutation out into the world. Unfortunately for them, that\nattraction comes so quickly in life that they rarely get a chance to mature as creative forces. So what they end up doing is just being able to handle through the ego those forces that are constantly trying to\ninterfere with them.\n\nThere is a famous writer in America named Truman Capote. He wrote 'In Cold Blood' which made a couple of million dollars for him. He was a very bizarre homosexual with very funny habits. He made all\nthis money and could not write anymore. He kept on telling people that he was working on a novel and he did that for 22 years until he died. When he died and they went through all of his papers, that book did not\nexist, but he had an incredible endurance.\n\nThere is a famous story about him. He wrote the screen play for the film African Queen' with Humphrey\nBogart and in those days, when they made the film, he literally had to change the script every single day so that they all had to work together, the writers and the actors. Bogart was somebody who was very\ncrude. Capote had a funny little voice, a kind of squeaky, high pitched voice. He really sounded hilarious when you heard him speak. Bogart was making fun of his voice and one evening Bogart challenged him\nto an arm wrestle and Capote beat him. This was something that really humiliated poor Bogart. Capote was quite a funny character.\n\nThe truth is that what the outside wants from creative people is that they do not bring any mutation because it is frightening, but they are allowed to be fools and clowns. They are allowed to be the symbols\nof creativity and they are allowed to have creative characters as long as they do not bring mutation.\n\nPage 5\n\nSociety does not like mutation. It makes them very uncomfortable. Sometimes the real creative ones are shunned.\n\nThe whole thing about creative expression as a role, the mystery and secret of that, goes back to the very first line. The very first line talks about Time is everything. Everything about the creative process is about\ntime because mutation is not something that you can truly appreciate in its time. When mutation takes place, the fact that mutation takes place in any given moment is a mystery to the vast majority of the\nplanet. It takes place in a unique individual and it will have its time. We live in a different kind of age, in an age where we are able to transmit information images simultaneously, instantaneously, wherever\nmutation is taking place in the world. But time is the quality that distinguishes whether a mutation is valuable or not. I doubt very much if anybody 300 years from now will pay any attention to Andy\nWarhol. I doubt that.\n\nThe perspective of whether a mutation really has been of value, whether a mutation has really been effective or not, we are blind to that in our own time. It is one of the things to realize why the artistic\nspirit longs for immortality. Immortality is something that you only hear from the creative spirit because it recognizes that only time, a lot of time, is going to distinguish whether something is truly art, truly\ngreat, and truly mutative. Only then, and it will take time before the perspective can be there that looks back and says, \"Ahal That was something that really made a difference. That was something that brought\na mutation.,\" So it is a question of time.\n\nThe creative force in the first line recognizes that timing controls the creative process at work. In other words, one cannot push it. One has to wait. It has its own timing and the fact of the matter is that even\nwhen the mutation has taken place, there is no place for expectation. This is not abstract. This is not collective. This is not about being best. This is simply about the recognition that mutation has taken place\nand one lives with that mutation until the end of one's days. Time: generation after generation, in their looking back, to see clearly the value of whether something was art, was beautiful, was the right direction,\nwas a mutation, only then can that be clear.\n\n1.6 Objectivity\n\nThis leads us to the dilemma of the 1.6 because the 1.6 knows that. It sits up there on top of the house of creativity and it looks across to the 43.1 which says, \"Hey, patience.\" All resistance has to be eliminated.\nThis has to get out into the world. The mutation has to take its place. It takes a long, long time. You will never live long enough to appreciate the impact of that mutation. I know that. I live that. What I share\nwith you, what we work with in Human Design. There is no possible way that I can see what that is going to be because the perspective on that will take place long after I'm gone. 300 years from now or 400 years\nfrom now, somebody may be able to look back on that perspective and see the mutative value and beauty in all this. It can't be judged now. It can only be lived as a mutation now, nothing else.\n\nThe 1.6 is a question of Objectivity. Clear assessment of creative value. But how do you know? What we consider to be high art today, what will it be tomorrow? We don't know that. There are millions and\nmillions of pieces of creativity that are garbage, long forgotten. Not everything can be mutative. So this question of what is of creative value becomes an enormous dilemma for the 1.6. It looks out and says,\n\"Yes, okay. I look at it now. It seems to be okay, but how will this stand the test of time?\" Go out in the street and look at one of these new buildings. It may be attractive today in our consciousness, maybe.\nWhat will it look like from the next phase looking back? Will it still have a place? Will we be pleased to see those buildings survive? I doubt it. Clear assessment of creative value. That is the point.\n\nThe Earth exalted with no explanation; it does not say anything about this. This clear assessment is a lifelong process and, at the end of your life, it can only be comparative and you still do not know. We are\n\nPage 6\n\ntalking about mutation. Human beings are so damn selfish. They want everything in their time. We are a species and our species operates beyond generational borderlines. It is a movement. Mutation is a\nmovement and it goes far beyond a single lifetime. Any mutation that is of value travels hundreds of generations. This is something that can only be judged in time by looking back.\n\nPluto in detriment. The risk that subjective appraisal will result in disappointment and creative frustration.\nWell, you are not going to get a lot of creative expression out of a 1.6 because they recognize clearly what really will be mutative. What happens in the detriment is that there is this subjectivity that comes in and it\nonly comes early in life that pulls them saying, \"Yes, this is it.\" That is the person who says, \"This is the most beautiful thing.\" This subjective appraisal leads to disappointment because time just passes it by and\nfive years later nobody is interested in it because it is just a fad. It was not really of creative value and it did not really bring a mutation. Then the 1.6 stands back and says, \"Okay.\"\n\nIn the white book, the Earth is given its value. Clarity in creative expression. Remember the relationship between the sixth line and wisdom. Though the 1.6 is not involved on a moment by moment basis with\ntrying to assert its creative uniqueness, it has a much greater process going on. That process can flower in the end. That is the perspective that really sees clearly whether the mutation is something that will have\nthat generational transcendent power to it. Nobody can recognize that better than a 1.6, sitting on the roof of the house, looking at the creative impulse of the world. It has the capability of objectively saying,\n\"That mutation will take hold. That will go. I bet that 400 years from now, everyone is doing that.\"\n\nThat is the possibility that lies there as wisdom. It is about time. The nature of bringing love into the world is not about loving your neighbor; it is about loving yourself. (This is something that I get to when I\ntalk about the vessel of love.) The important thing about bringing real true creative mutation into the world is simply about these individual forces being themselves, nothing more and nothing less. What\nhappens is that we have this enormous need of the ego to assert itself because we need to survive on the material plane. The material plane is: feed me now, fill my stomach now. Mutation is not about that. It is\nnot. It takes its time.\n\nPage 7",

We become a real corporation and we will bring in all these outsiders to help us in this process to expand.\" For members of the tribe, for members of that family, that can be very\nfrightening because it is no longer a family community business.

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 45 GATHERING TOGETHER\n\nThe 45th gate is the only outlet for the entire tribal process, so this gate carries with it an enormous importance that is part of our evolutionary process. There will be a time, long away from now, when the\n45 will actually become aware and will be part of what we now consider an ajna process. The 45 is very important. It is the only voice in the throat that is a purely possessive voice and therefore it is the only\nplace within the Throat in which the manifestation of possession takes place. To have and not have, to get and not get, to be able to control and not control: all this is rooted in the nature of the 45.\n\nThe 45 is a gate of action. It is directly connected to the ego and, in that sense, very different from the 35 and the 12 that are connected to the solar plex. It is not operating in the wave of the solar plex. It is\noperating out of the energy of the ego which we call willpower or, when we are being negative, egoism.\n\nThe 45 is the gate of the tribal leader. This is not the collective leadership of the 31. This is the tribal leader, the leader by blood. This is the queen and the king. This is the lord and the lady. This is the\nleading family in a community. This is all this kind of blood hierarchy.\n\nAbove the lines is says: The natural and generally beneficial attraction of like forces. The keyword here is 'beneficial.' This is the nature of the 45. The responsibility of the king and queen, regardless of whether\nthey are pashas or not, or possessive or not, regardless of whether they have to have the nicest crown and throne, their power lies in them being of benefit to the tribe. As long as they can be of benefit to the tribe,\nthey can indulge in anything, including decadence. As long as their benefit is there for the tribe, they are of value.\n\n45.1 Canvassing\n\nWhen you begin with the first line, you begin with the inherent recognition that to be a 45 is to be, by your very nature, beneficial to the tribe. That does not mean that you get to exercise that beneficence.\nAfter all, if you do not have the other side, then you always have to wait for the energy to come.\n\nThe first line is called Canvassing which is: The ability to promote and develop gathering together through the education of the uncommitted. Mars in detriment. An over-zealousness that turns canvassing\ninto proselytization and tends to alienate rather than gather support. This is all about education.\n\nIn terms of the white book: The material direction lies in education, or The drive for material that leads to aggressive education.\n\nThe whole thing about being the leader of the tribe is that the way in which the tribe benefits is by being educated. The more educated the community, the more successful it becomes. We live in an age in which\nwe have watched this historically over the last 300 years: the development of public education and the vast improvement in the nature of our lives and the ability for us to have representative democracies in\nwhich the population as a whole is given a responsibility for the direction of the people. This is the byproduct of education. The key to the nature of the 45 is that, if they can bring education to the tribe,\nthey are always going to be of benefit, which means they themselves have to be educated.\n\nIt is very important for 45's to be educated and, of course, this is a joke because all aristocracy has been privileged in having education while the rest of humanity was left behind. It is built into being a 45 that\nyou must have a solid education because it is only out of that grounding that you can be of benefit to those that are in your community.\n\nPage 1\n\nAt the mundane level, at the material level, this is about being successful in business when you can provide something new, something of educational value, something that the other does not know anything\nabout. For example, the first person that brings the refrigerator into the community that never had one before. When the tribal leader brings the refrigerator and says, \"Let me educate you about the benefits of\nthis refrigerator. \" You can be a salesman in a shop or you can be the tribal leader, but what you are trying to bring is of benefit.\n\nThis is one of the keys to the 45. If the 45 is not providing something that is of benefit to the community, whatever they make, whatever money they bring into their lives, will poison them. I am being very heavy\nbecause it is accurate. This is the whole nature of possession. The 45 is allowed to possess. This is their nature. They have to possess. At the same time, out of their possession, they must bring benefit to others\nand it must be of value to others. If they just make money from the tribe, \"Here I have the ABC box and you should all have my picture hanging in your house,\" that is not a leader benefiting the public because\nthey have to buy that. They have to invest in that and, ultimately, the money that comes from that will be poisoned because it is not of benefit. The leader must bring things of benefit. The first line knows that its\nbeneficence is there, but it does not necessarily know how to bring that to the tribe.\n\n45.2 Consensus\n\nThe second line is projection, so you know what these people are projecting out. They project out that they can be the tribal leader and that they can be of benefit to others. The fact that this is a mechanical\ngate in the throat, a metamorphic gate, means that there are already built into these people techniques of bringing about this beneficial impact.\n\nThe second line is called Consensus. Gathering together is strengthened by acknowledged common interest. Well, it does not work any other way. These people are projecting out that they can be of benefit.\nBut they can only really be of benefit to those people that they can really be of benefit to. Otherwise, they are paper tigers and it may not turn out to be that way and they are uncomfortable.\n\nUranus exalted. The inventiveness to establish techniques by which common ground can be assessed. So, there is a quality within these people that they can project out, which is that they can provide a beneficial\ntechnique to others.\n\nIn the white book: A material direction through the expression of techniques for the benefit of others.\nPlease, do not forget this beneficence. It always has to be built into this process. The difficulty with the second line is that, because they are projecting outwards, there are only certain people (this is not a\ntranspersonal line) that they can really be of benefit for. They feel handicapped by those people for which they are not of benefit.\n\nThey end up with the pressure of the other side, which is: An innate rebellion against conformityor, in terms of the white book: The refusal to accept the material techniques of others. That is like being the\nking and saying, \"This is the way things work.\" And, instead of having a subject that says, \"This is not for me,\" you have a subject that comes up to you and says to you, \"Your technique is wrong.\" The 45.2 in\ndetriment does not want to hear anything like that. They are not going to pay attention to somebody else telling them what and how the benefit should be. They are people that try to become the power behind the\nthrone, and they try to control. These 45.2's can often get controlled from behind by other people.\n\n45.3 Exclusion\n\nMost difficult in the 45 is the third line. So many third lines are difficult simply because they are involved in this trial and error process. Because the wave is about bonds made and broken, this is extremely\n\nPage 2\n\ndifficult for a tribal leader. The bond for a tribal leader is only broken when they die. This is something that is clear for them in the nature of their process. This is not an official that you can un-elect. This is a\ntribal leader. You either kill them or you wait until they die, but they are going to be the leader until they die. This is the way we used to live with kings in this world.\n\nThis line is called Exclusion. It says: The ability when excluded to take whatever measures are necessary to dissolve the antiquated form and to accept even humiliation to achieve inclusion. These are people who\nknow that they are the ones that can bring the benefits but they do not always get that recognition.\nBecause so often in their growing process, they offer a benefit that they can bring, and there is a mistake involved and it does not really work out, due to that, they don't necessarily trust themselves. Nor do the\nothers who hook into that energy trust them that there really is something that can work. Yet at the same time, because it is in their blood, it is in their genetics to be a leader, they will do anything, including\naccepting humiliation, to get close to that center of power, so that they can eventually have their opportunity to be beneficial to others. The instinct to find a way to be included in a material process.\n\nThe other side is: The expression of frustration when not included in a material process. This is as it says in the black book: An aggressive and often violent reaction to exclusion. For example: succession in a\nfamily. You have five children and one of them becomes the ruler of the tribe. One of those children realizes within themselves that they are the one that can bring a better benefit to the tribe and that they\nwill be a better leader, but they have to accept the humiliation of not being the leader and still stay close to the leadership. On the positive side, they make their contribution that way. They will slowly try to\neducate the one that is really in power to get the benefits out somehow so that they can participate in that process. But, if they have the detriment, then they hire an assassin and they kill their sibling and they take\nover the throne. Or the producer who controls the film instead of the director. The director has to suffer the humiliation of putting up with the producer saying, \"You have to do this and that.\" And slowly, the\ndirector tries to find a way in which he can influence the producer, so that it comes out beneficially the way he wants. Of course, in the extreme, you kill the producer.\n\n45.4 Direction\n\nWhen you come to the upper trigram, you come to the fourth line. You come to externalization, to this fixed recognition that, first of all, there is another side. The 45/21 never works properly when it is inside\nsomebody's chart. If you see somebody who has this whole channel, you know that they will always have difficulties. This is a channel that is designed to be electro-magnetic, in order to be at its most effective.\nThe awareness in the fourth line is the recognition and the mechanic that there is a force on the other side, the 21, the power of the ego to drive this whole process. The fourth line is called Direction. This is a fixed\nexternalization of being of benefit. That is what it is all about.\n\nThe ability to focus the opportunity of gathering together for the service of higher principles. 'Higher principles' means: is it of benefit? That is all. Don't get caught up in thinking that is has to be spiritual or\nmystical. It has to do with the mundane plane and being able to provide for the tribe. When it comes to the tribe, the highest principles are food, shelter and health. That is number one. After that, there are all\nthese different levels. Higher principles mean that, whatever the source of the material plane is, it has to bring benefit to those who will receive all of that.\n\nOn the other side, we have Mars in detriment. The tendency to try to influence the direction of a group action for personal benefit. That is okay. It is the same process. These people make sure that, while they\nare being of benefit to everybody else, they are really of benefit to themselves as well. They are not just simply fixed on externalizing their beneficial value to others.\n\nPage 3\n\nIn the white book: The expression (or the lack of expression) of higher principles on the material plane. If you get involved in bringing false benefits to the community, this will always backlash against the 45,\neven if it is the 21 who does it. It is the 45 that has to take the responsibility for that. So, it is very important for 45 's to recognize that whatever they are involved in on the material plane, they have to see\nthe direct benefit of their work. If they cannot see the direct benefit of their work, they are in the wrong kind of work because it is going to bring back all kinds of negative energy into their life. The other thing\nis, like in all fourth lines, it waits for opportunity.\n\n45.5 Leadership\n\nYou get to the fifth line and you get to universalization. Again, this is the way in which the community, the tribe, will project onto this fifth-line person. It is always projected onto them that they really are the\nleader. These are people that naturally can be made leaders in a community because the community will project this quality onto them. Whether you are dealing with the exalted or the detriment in this line, there\nis very little difference, other than that the detriment talks about the immature process. It is about what it takes to slowly develop that recognition because it is built in.\n\nThis line is called Leadership. All gathering must have a center and a focus. This is about the leader. They are the center, the focus. They are the one. Uranus exalted. The intuitive intellect and gift for innovation\nthat enhance the group effort and ensure continuity through respect for the center. They are projected on to be the tribal authority and, in the exalted side, they have the capacity to live that out.\n\nThe gift for expressing leadership on the material plane. By the way, the way a 45 expresses their leadership is always being able to educate others so that they can benefit, which means that they direct.\nThey tell people what to do; they don't do the doing themselves. That is why the 21 connected to the 45 in a chart is of no value whatsoever to the 45, because the 45 then says, \"I have to do.\" This is not for them\nto do. They have to educate and provide the benefit, but it is for the tribe to work out those benefits, to go through that process.\n\nThe Jupiter in detriment. A sense of right action that assumes a respect that may not as yet have been earned. This side is the difficulty for the child. This is the situation where the child itself recognizes its\nleadership quality but, of course, leadership is something that you have to establish. You have to be able to show that you can do it. When you are young, you do not have that experience. So, the reality is that\nthese children seem very arrogant, very aristocratic. They can feel like, \"I am a pasha and everything should come to me now,\" instead of waiting until the time comes that they can really earn that by truly\nbeing of benefit to others. Again, they are the product of the projection field on them.\n\nIn the white book: The drive for leadership that may not have yet earned the right. What I say to these people is, \"That is okay. You will eventually get the respect. You just keep on working on your process.\"\nThat is what it is all about.\n\n45.6 Reconsideration\n\nThis 45.6 is very extraordinary because it goes directly to the 12.1. The 12th gate is the gate called\nStandstill. Standstill is where mutation is spread. It is out of 12th gate, which is a mutative gate, that we first got our voice. It is the gate in which all mutation gets to manifest out into the world. The 45.6 is\nlooking directly at this individual mutative process and its social capacity to spread that mutation. The\n45.6 is the kind of tribal leader that makes the tribe very nervous because it is the only tribal leader that recognizes that, unless we integrate the strangers, the outsiders, into the tribe, the genetic pool of the tribe\nis going to die.\n\nPage 4\n\nImagine what that is like if it is a family business. The head of the family business says, \"The only way that this business is really going to grow now is if we stop having it as a family business. We put our\nshares on the stock market. We become a real corporation and we will bring in all these outsiders to help us in this process to expand.\" For members of the tribe, for members of that family, that can be very\nfrightening because it is no longer a family community business. All of a sudden, outsiders are coming in.\n\nThis sixth line, like all sixth lines, knows that it is not enough to be the tribal leader. \"I don't want to be just this tribal leader. I don't want to sit in my tipi, in my village, living a primitive life for the rest of my\ndays. I want a television, a computer...\" The reality is that the sixth line recognizes the intrinsic value of the outsider. On one side: Let's just bring the outsiders in. On the other side: Once we have them in, let's\ncontrol them so that the rest of the tribe is happy.\n\nSo, you have all kinds of rulers in history. (Catherine the Great, who brought all the French philosophers into the court.) They brought the outsiders in to try to bring about a broader mutation in the tribe, so that\nthe tribe would grow and become healthier, thus bringing a benefit from the outside. New genes, new blood, new ideas and new concepts. All of that is a threat to the tribe because the tribe likes its traditions.\nIt does not expect its leaders to be heretics, but the reality is that their leader can turn around on them and say, \"Yes, but I want to bring in all these foreign people because I think that this will be beneficial to our\nsociety.\"\n\nWe all know what happens afterwards. We have that in our all modern countries where you have all kinds of immigration and then you have the native tribe and you bring in all these other forces, and after a while\nyou get a backlash in all of that because the tribe gets upset.\n\nA material direction which serves the outsider; or A material direction that is focused on conditioning the outsider to conform.\n\nAn outsider who can admit that its prior rejection was an error will generally be accepted into the gathering. To bring the outsiders in is the gift of the sixth line. An innate empathy with the outsider\nmentality and its eccentric and often misunderstood logic. This works on many levels, but the real level is that if you don't bring the strangers in, the tribe is going to fail. It is going to die. If you do not bring a\nstranger into the business, it is not going to be successful.\n\nJupiter in detriment. Where Uranus will innovate to find a place for an outsider, Jupiter will demand that it conforms. \"Okay, you are a stranger. You have come here and you have fallen in love with my\ndaughter, and you do not come from the same tribe as me. I don't mind that you are here. You can be my son, but you have to behave like we behave here in this village. Bring your blood, but I am going to\ncontrol you and make sure that you look like everybody else in the tribe, so that nobody gets upset and bothers my poor daughter because she has married this freak, this outsider.\" This is the sixth line saying,\n\"Okay, you can come in as a stranger, but I will control you.\"\n\nAll of this is about understanding that, rooted in the 45.6, is the opportunity for the tribe to mutate. If the tribe cannot mutate, we will have no changes in this world that are really of value. It is only when the\ntribe changes that the world changes. The collective is impersonal. The tribe is there in deep support for each other. Only when we can mutate the tribe are we going to have eventual mutation in the way that we\nlive with each other and the way we share the resources of the world.\n\nPage 5",

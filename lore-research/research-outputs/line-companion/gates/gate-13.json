  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 13 THE FELLOWSHIP OF MAN\n\nWe come to the collective process, to one of the role gates. It is different from the individual process, which is about the individual direction, about being the direction. The perspective that we have in the role\nof individuality is the perspective of being able to release the role in the now, of just being able to get the creative process out.\n\nWhen you come into the collective roles, you come to something different. The logical collective role will project into the future and the abstract collective role will always looks backwards into the past. It is here\nthat the collective gets to establish where it has been and where it is going which gives it its sense of continuity and its sense of well-being. After all, everything about how we stabilize our existence is, in\nessence, about the collective field.\n\nWe come to the 13th hexagram, The Fellowship of Man, which is of extreme importance to the nature of what it is to be human. That is, the abstract circuitry represents our experiential way which is literally the\nway of being human. This way begins with the 41st hexagram, the initiating codon, the beginning of experience, and gets completed in this channel 33/13 of the witness and The Prodigal. It is something to\nunderstand about the nature of any abstract process: nothing is really learned until the process is really over.\n\nIt is one of the keys to being in the abstract (you will see that particularly in the Vessel of Love, in the\n46): to be in the experience because, unless one is totally absorbed within the experience, one does not accrue enough information for a proper reflection later. If you are not always looking in the rear view\nmirror, you are bound to miss certain things that you have passed.\n\nThe 13 l gate is the gate of the listener, but more important than that, it is a gate of secrets because it collects the reflections of the past. This is one of the many gates within the rave system that is specifically\nassociated with memory. Above the lines in the hexagram it says: Universal ideas and values in an ordered framework which inspires humanistic cooperation.\n\n'Universal ideas and values in an ordered framework...\" This is the whole process of collecting the past.\nThe time is the continuity or, in the case of the passenger driving in the car, the distance is the continuity.\nWe do that with calendars. We have a big date coming up: 2000. It gives us this sense of continuity and we can all look back 1000 years and can say, \"Well, we have completed this continuity.\"\n\n...which inspires humanistic cooperation. That is, it is this continuity and the collection of history that inspires humanity. It is true. It inspires humanity in the sense that, unlike our mammalian cousins, we\ndon't have to start over every generation. Human beings have this capacity to be able to store memory and then to be able to exchange it, to share it within in the nature of the collective process.\n\nThis sharing of history is indeed inspiring to humanity. It is a much faster process today, for example, than it was 100 years ago. Our collection system is faster, our dispersion system is faster and the faster we\nget, the more advanced each generation is from the one before it because it gets to learn essential information that has been learned by the previous generation. And it gets to learn it right away when it\ncomes into the world. This is the advantage of the 13th gate: to store our experience in order to inspire humanity with it.\n\n13.1 Empathy\n\n\"The ability to relate and commune with everyone with equanimity\" is something that you learn in the lifetime and not something that you learn right away. All first lines give you a key. The key in this\n\nPage 1\n\nhexagram is about the empathic process. The line is called Empathy and it is an overview line, which means that The lower trigram does not know that there is anyone to listen to and everything they hear is\nsort of by accident. In other words, they really get secrets in a way. They hear things that they did not even realize they were supposed to hear or could hear and suddenly they have access to it.\n\nVenus exalted. \"Harmony through affection. A role of openness in listening to others with affection. \"\nThe 13th gate is the role of the self in its openness for interaction with others, in its ability to be receptive to others and because this is a gate that collects history, it collects people's stories. It is by its very nature\nan empathic gate. It is always pulling people to it in that sense.\n\nIn the white book, we have this Venusian Role of openness in listening to others with affection. This is one of the foundations of getting secrets out of people. For example, in crime movies where you have the\ngood cops and the bad ones. The good one is so sweet that he always gets the story. This is empathic listening with affection.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. The politician kissing babies. An openness that is never free of motives. \" This is superficial affection, but at the same time, the politician that is ready to go out and to kiss the babies is\nempathic enough to hear the stories of the parents.\n\nIn the white book: An openness that is never free of motives. It is very important to see that motive is going to be a part of the 13th gate process because the 13 is burdened by other people. The lower trigram\nalways feels the burden the greatest. They say, \"Why do people bother me? I have to listen to them.\"\nThere is a genuine affection built into this gate where it does tend to listen for the sake of soothing the other rather than for what it thinks it is going to hear or for the value of what it is going to hear is. It is just\ncollecting in that sense.\n\n13.2 Bigotry\n\nOne of the things you must have noticed in your work with Human Design is that second lines have funny names and they are often deeply misunderstood, like the 58.2, Perversion, the 46.2, Prima donna, the\n18.2, Terminal disease, or Degeneracy in the 48.2. Second lines have strong names and people are always very concerned about them, mostly because they simply cannot understand how the line actually works.\n\nRealize what a second line is: that other people are seeing you as that aspect; they are looking inside of you and see you. Think about what happens to the 13.2. Everybody who steps into the aura of a 13.2\nassumes that they are going to listen to them empathetically. They just assume it. The 13.2 is minding its own business, not listening and not needing to hear anything in particular. All of a sudden, there is\nsomebody stepping into its aura and telling it things and the 13.2 is quite surprised. What happens to the\n13.2 (think about lines as children) is that they end up listening to all kinds of different voices they have no control over and they end up being quite frankly disgusted by it. They hear that people have a lot of\ncrap to say.\n\nRemember that the 13 is really here to distinguish the values and ideals that we have experienced in order to inspire humanity. Here is the 13.2 being forced to listen to all kinds of different people. Do not\nmisunderstand that line of Bigotry. A 13.2 gets all these people in their life telling them things that they did not ask for in the first place. Yes, they end up being quite discriminatory. The risk, always present,\nthat fellowship can only exist for a particular type, whether racial, religious, national or intellectual.\n\nMoon exalted. Tolerance as the least offensive manifestation of bigotry. In the white book: A role of openness through tolerance. This is not a dirty word. The fact of the matter is that the 13.2 that has the\nexalted still has to suffer many fools in their lives and they wonder, \"Why am I listening to all this stuff?\"\n\nPage 2\n\nIn the detriment: The obsessive belief that the highest ideals cannot be embraced by the lowest forms. An extremely difficult position, where even the highest ideals provide rationalization for hatred. It is not\ndifficult, given the experience of what it is to be human, to find things to dislike about human beings. We know that. We find things to dislike about the people that we love the most. After all, we are very good at\nfinding things that we dislike about other human beings. It is quite a common thing.\n\nThe detriment in the white book: A role of openness so narrow that there is practically no one worth listening to. They may in fact go deaf and will not listen to any of it because \"They are all fools and they\nare just bothering me.\" That does not preclude that they will get to hear what they have to. Remember, this is deeply social. We are talking about the collective gate which is by its very nature social. This\ncollection of history is a social phenomenon that we used to have as oral history when the shaman of the tribe tells the story of their fathers and grandfathers. Thus, a tradition of knowledge is built based on the\ncommunication of experience. 13.2's can end up being quite bitter about the nature of what humanity really is. Don't blame them for being the bigots.\n\nThere is a risk that is referred to in the introduction line that refers to there being a risk for humanity if this would dominate in the world. It is part of what we have in the world a lot of prejudice. Prejudice can\nbe positive or negative. You can have a 13.2 that has a relatively clean psyche and their prejudice is something that they learn to deal with because they learn to see that human beings just don't have always\nsomething worthwhile to contribute. On the other hand, you have all kinds of people that will take the\n\n13.2 and turn that into a reason to dislike the other. So it is a risk for humanity.\n\nThere is this moment for a 13.2 where, all of sudden, people that you never expected to have something important to say, do so. Usually children do that to them. That awakens the possibility that you can\nactually hear something worthwhile from the unexpected. Kids can say something very profound and it just changes the 13.2.\n\nBy the way, the answer for all second lines is rooted in the individual process in the 10.2, where it says, 'Be a hermit,' and in the 12.2, where it says, 'Purify yourself from all negative forces.' You have to be very\ncareful with any second line that you let into your aura because they can penetrate you so easily and see that aspect in your nature.\n\n13.3 Pessimism\n\nThe third line, because it is an adaptive line and because it is trial and error, you will have trial and error in who you listen to. It is not the uncontrolled process that happens to the second line. This is a process of\ntuning in through trial and error who you listen to, who you take in to hear. You can see that in the line called Pessimism, which is an overview line, that it is a lifelong process.\n\nThe belief that what is best can never be achieved. This is something that the third line learns as a curve in life. This is its learning process. What happens to it is that the moment that it is listening to a certain type,\nit gets what it does not want to hear. It gets to see in that human being what it does not want. It tries to listen to another type. It goes through quite a process of disappointment in life about the nature of what a\nhuman being is.\n\nThe Earth exalted. A lack of trust that can only be transformed through concrete evidence. This is a possibility for mutation in the abstract process: to make sense out of the past. It helps to have evidence\nrather than just speculation. 13.3's become very suspicious of people. They become deeply mistrusting of them and they are the kind of people that know a kind of storyline being delivered to them. They are very\ngood at hearing the propaganda, the lie.\n\nPage 3\n\nIn the white book: Openness that is conditioned by suspicion and seeks evidence. In America, they have this wonderful expression: 'the Man from Missouri' who says, \"Show me.\" It is always this hand out.\n\"Show me. Put it here in my hand. Let me see exactly what it is.\"\n\nVenus in detriment. Pessimism exalted to an art form... The one thing about realizing that human beings don't live up to the ideal is that they are also humorous in the way that they do not live up to the ideal.\nOne can call that black humor but it can become art. It can become satire. In other words, rather than trying to inspire humanity with history and facts, which can be quite brutal (who can read the historic\nrecord of the last century and not be astounded at how barbaric human beings can be?), this is satire. The satire can have the same effect. It can inspire humanity.\n\nMy favorite 13.3 story is about the famous Irish writer, Jonathan Swift, a member of the English parliament, who was born the beginning of the 18th century. He is the author of 'Gulliver's Travels'.\nDuring that time, the English and the Irish had trouble with each other so he wrote a satire: 'Modest\nProposal'. What he proposed, in order to make everybody happy, was that the Irish should sell their babies to the English for food. He talked about how wonderful that would be. There would not be so many Irish\nbabies, so this would not be a problem. People would have enough to eat and babies are really delicious and he gave recipes for cooking them. He described how the English would love to eat these fresh babies\nand there would not be these supply problems. It was satire. It was meant to humiliate the English. The fact is that the satire was actually taken seriously by some people, which is really quite astonishing. The\nimpact of pessimism as art is that it humiliates us to the point that we laugh at ourselves and, perhaps, that has some impact on our direction.\n\nBecause the 13th gate is a gate of secrets, every time the lower trigram gets access to the throat, what pops out is something that the 13th gate is unprepared for because it is not consciously holding onto what\nit is listening to in that gate. The 13th is a gate where memory is stored. How that memory pops out is dependent on the 33 that steps into its aura, or on whatever way it gets that information out. Often that\nsatire can be cruel and bitter and, sometimes, 13.3s can say things to people that are just devastating, which is actually their form of satire but can be taken as something that is bitterly cruel.\n\n13.4 Fatigue\n\nWith the fourth line we come to the recognition that there is an opportunity as a possibility for expression out of the throat. Because of that, the fourth and fifth lines, in particular, have a different process that they\nhave to deal with. Third lines are inherently weak. It is a weakness simply in the sense that third lines always have to adapt, always have to go through trial and error and mistakes. In that sense, it is an\ninherent weakness. But when you come to the abstract process, you will find that the real weakness in this process is in the fourth line and not in the third. You can smell the weakness of the abstract process in the\n30.4, Burnout. Here, we have a very similar fourth line to the 30.4. This line is called Fatigue.\n\nThink about what happens: the 13th gate is there to listen. The lower trigram only listens when it is broken in on because it does not look for it. It does not know that the possibility is out there that someone\nwill tell it something. But the fourth line knows that and it goes out there to listen. It is ready to listen and because of that, it does not get to do the most important thing, which is that after listening comes the\nreflection. It just keeps on listening. This is somebody who decides that they will write a great book about the experiences of people in Sarajevo during the civil war. What they end up doing is recording people\nendlessly. They never write their book. They are totally burned out by the process of just going through listening. Fatigue.\n\nOverview line: The point of exhaustion eventually reached when one is too tired to fight. This will have a deep significance, depending on the nature of the design and type. If you have an energy type, they will\n\nPage 4\n\nlisten longer than those who are not. The energy and the non-energy type, though both will still reach the same point of exhaustion, they will reach it at different times in their lives.\n\nPluto exalted. This is the only line in the 13 that is Pluto-related and this is a generation that was born in the 1940's or 1950's. The renaissance that comes with truce and its eventual reinvigoration. In other\nwords, this is the moment where you stop the listening. They finally learn to stop listening. They have heard enough. They do not need to hear anymore.\n\nOpenness which leads to exhaustion and the need for silence. You can interpret the silence as a need for reflection afterwards. There must be this space; otherwise, it does not work.\n\nOn the other side of this fourth line, we have Venus in detriment. Emotional exhaustion. Appeasement and withdrawal. Regarding the emotional context that is given here, the abstract process is deeply related\nto the solar plex system. Our human experience is conditioned by the solar plex. The desire in life, the desire to be alive, the desire for life, is all rooted in the emotional system. Those people who are 13's end\nup taking in an enormous amount of emotional energy in their life. Somebody goes down in their emotional wave, seeks out the 13 to unburden themselves and the 13 ends up taking it all in. You find that\n13's with undefined emotional systems end up being very sick, whereas 13's with a defined emotional system can survive it because they generate their own wave.\n\nThe detriment in the white book: A role where openness is a vulnerability. Think about the irony here.\nFourth lines are normally very influential because they are one-tracked and focused and because they do have the gift of externalizing. But here, it is detriment. Here, the fact that one can externalize the listening\nalso means that, in their fixedness, they don't know how to stop listening. Only when they get to the point of exhaustion do they stop. These are people that end up working as social therapists of some kind and\nthey build their schedule so that they have people talk to them all day long, every day. After three or four months they collapse; they get very sick, take three weeks off to recuperate because they are very ill, and\nthen they go back into exactly the same program because they do not know how to stop listening unless they are exhausted.\n\nOne of my favorite stories about the 13's in my life. I have the 33.6. I originally had a publisher who wanted to bring out the Human Design system in English and German. He told me he knew a very good\ntranslator and that he would get in touch with him. I was living in Bavaria at that time and the publisher told me that the translator was nearby. The first time I was given Jiirgen's name, I asked for his data\nbecause I wanted to see his chart. Jiirgen has the 13.2 and the 13.5. 1 said: \"A bigot savior. That is perfect for Human Design. \"\n\n13.5 The Savior\n\nEverybody projects on the 13.5 that they will listen. That is not necessarily true. They may not be willing to listen to others. However, this is a projected field and the fact is that we, society as a whole, consider\nlisteners to be our saviors. That is very important to understand. What that reveals is just an intrinsic quality of what it is to be human. We are here to share with each other the nature of what it is to be in the\nworld. That is why here in this fifth line, in this gate, we have such a name. We give great spiritual value to such a name. It is our salvation that we have the gift of being able to share with each other and in that\nway, to be able to inspire new generations with what we have been able to achieve in our experience. As an advantage, we make it a lot easier for them. So, 13.5's can be honored in this life. They can also be\ndeeply burdened.\n\nThe Savior. The ability to overcome all obstacles for the betterment of humanity. The fact is that 13.5's get information from people who would otherwise never tell you anything. Nothing. The 13.5's get those\n\nPage 5\n\nsecrets. They get them because, even for those people who are so deeply silent, they recognize that this could be their savior. They do not really think that. It is just an opportunity for them to unburden\nthemselves. Human beings need to unburden themselves. One of the reasons why we have partners in this life is so that we have somebody we can say to, \"I had a terrible day today,\" and you can commiserate\ntogether over how terrible your day has been. We really need that. It is part of being human.\n\nNeptune exalted. Always be suspicious when you see Neptune exalted. What that is saying to you is: you don't really know what is going on, which means that that can already be a dilemma. The other thing it is\nsaying is that if you don't bother with it, you have a spiritual opportunity. The charismatic genius who can find a role for everyone.\n\nIn the white book: The listener that has a gift for finding a role for others. Remember that this is the perspective of the driver looking backwards. We have gone this way, that way and the other way and, by\nthe 13.5 listening, they can see how that person fits into those various roles. \"This is your way. I know all about this way. Let me tell you about this way.\"\n\nJupiter in detriment (not very detrimental). The able administrator. Given the extreme positive nature of this position, mundane application is rare. 'Extreme' is a word that is not used very often.\nIn the white book: The listener whose gift for finding a role for others is practical and suited to administration. Go back to what it is to be a 13.5 child. It is very different. The 13.5 baby who comes into\nthe world is not a savior and yet, this baby gets to hear his mother's laments. The mother does not really realize that the baby is taking that in or pulling it out. They hear things growing up that they do not\nnecessarily want to hear. They find out things that they do not necessarily want to find out and they get to experience things they do not necessarily want to experience.\n\nOut of that process comes the projection of being a listener. But, of course, there is also a great advantage because people are willing to tell them things. They have the advantage of knowing a great deal because\nof that. Thus, they can be of value to humanity in being able to share that experience. Whether or not that gets out is another story. Again, remember that this is a gate that has great transpersonal skills but it still\nhas to find the 33 at the other side in order to express itself properly.\n\n13.6 The Optimist\n\nWhen you look at the 13.6, think about the 59.6. Think about it in the sense that this is the course of promiscuous listening that takes place when one is young and quickly ends because one ends up looking\nfor the soul mate to listen to, that perfect person or thing to listen to. Sitting up there on the roof of the house, there is the dream that there is really an experience, that there is really something that is worth\nlistening to and worth reflecting upon for the benefit of humanity.\n\nThe Optimist. The ability to accept any limited interaction... (This is in the early part of life.) ... as a necessary step towards greater union. Remember that this is the harmony to the third line of Pessimism\nwhere one is constantly disappointed by what one meets in the world, that human beings are mundane, that what they talk about is not very interesting. It is just the same old human stuff and it is very easy to\nbecome pessimistic in the third line. But the sixth line knows better, in the sense that it is transpersonal. It looks to the whole circuitry, to the whole experiential way, and it knows that in that experience, there are\nthings of value that always come out. So there is hope.\n\nMars exalted. The energy to persevere. Unlimited hope. In the white book: The hope that openness will lead to better relationships. Again, please understand that the whole thing about the listener is that it is not\nwhat the listener is hearing; it is through whom the listener hears because this is so deeply social. This is about collecting history from others so that, in the end, the optimism is about the quality of the experience\n\nPage 6\n\nin the people that you meet. The old Chinese saying, \"May you live in interesting times.\" At least you have something interesting to say.\n\nMercury in detriment. Navvete. By the way, that naivete is often a presumption of others. That is, the hope is not naive. The abstract process is connected to the emotional wave and recognizes that hope is\npart of the world. It knows that there are things that can be hoped for because in the cycle of things they can be fulfilled.\n\nThe translation of mutual interest into universality. This detriment is not so bad. It is really about trying to find a way in which, through relationships, the experience of humanity is something that is uplifting. So,\nthe moment that the 13.6 finds some commonality with somebody, there is this sense that \"Maybe everybody could be like this,\" or \"Maybe everybody could do this.\"\n\nThe 13.6 does not have an easy place to go to. It goes to the 49.1. It goes to the place of emotional principles. It goes to the place that will establish what we really need. \"What is necessary?\" is the theme\nof the 49.1. So the 13.6 sits up there as an Optimist and hopes but at the same time, it realizes: \"Do I know what is really necessary?\" What it is looking for is a hope for what is necessary because what is\nnecessary will ultimately make the difference in experience.\n\nDon't expect 13.6's, once they are mature, to really listen. They often just don't. Like all sixth lines, they have that possibility for truly wise experiences. This naivete is only when they are young but it is also a\npresumption of others. That is, when you speak to an adult who is an optimist and they are full of hope, you tend to look at them as if they were a kind of bumpkin. The world is a tough place; we all know that.\nMost hopes in life that are really big hopes get dashed in the way life works. So, when you have a mature person telling you, \"I know that a better world will come; Jesus is coming,\" we think that they are naive,\nbut actually they are not. It is just the way they appear to be. It is not naive. It is part of what it is to be human, which is to suffer and to be hopeful at the other side. This is life. What to do?\n\nPage 7",

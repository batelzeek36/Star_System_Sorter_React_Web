An over-\nprincipled resistance that rather than being selective in resistance and thus less at risk, will maintain normal patterns and incur opposition.\n\nIn the Book of Letters, you can see how it moves both sides. On one side you have: The emotional power to handle crisis. The 36th gate is about that. These people always handle their crisis. It is the other that has\nproblems with the crisis. They both have a crisis, but the 36th gate cruises through it and the other person has a shattering experience. It is very good for them. By the way, it is an ancient end-of-the -wheel gate.

There is a new birth that can take place.\n\nBy the very nature of the hexagram, they are equipped to handle the crisis, but on the other side: A resistance to change that will always bring crisis. On the other side, they realize how much that crisis\ncauses havoc. The people with the 36th gate that are part of my life are so aware of how much crisis they have brought. They know that. There is a part of them that says, \"I really did not have to do this thing\nbecause I am sure that it will lead to problems. Better I leave this.\" You can't do that until you have reached your midlife point. There are only few exceptions. After all, the 35/36 is a mirror of the 16/48,\nand they are both about talent and talent takes time. In the logical process, it takes repetition and depth, and in the abstract process, it takes a great deal of experience and fortitude to survive the crises and keep\non going on in the experiential way. Slowly in their lives, they begin to recognize that not only do they go through crisis, but they can generate a great deal of crisis. Later in life, they become much more selective.\nThis is the maturing process that is built into this hexagram.\n\nRemember that it is the last hexagram in the wheel before you come to the 25, the alpha and the omega. It is both Pisces and Aries. So, the 36 is completing a process. Without going through crisis and without\ngetting to the experience, we do not get to the next experience. We do not start again in the wheel, being innocent. The 36.6 will lead to the 25.1, to the beginning of an initiating process, to the innocence, to the\nstart of a new cycle. It is a very important energy. It simply means that there are wounded ones along the way."

It is fixed; it has this one-pointedness about its nature. The\nmoment that you get into the upper trigram, you get into the social context. After all, we have a collective circuit here which is social by its very nature. Its keynote is to share and, by the time you get to the upper\ntrigram, what you are looking towards is the other side. The fourth line is about mastering the nature of the other.

These people will get their experience, and they will survive it. That does not mean anything about others. They are here to get their experience. When\nthey are really of value for others is when they have been through enough experiences.\n\nImmunity to crisis as both generator and survivor. In other words, no matter what their situation is, they can always move from inexperience to experience and always will, and damn the consequences. They are\nout there to get their experience. This is nature of what this hexagram is about.\n\nWhen you get to the other side, Mercury in detriment. A nervousness that can lead to self-betrayal. They can get very nervous because they know that the crisis is coming. They can feel it coming and sometimes\nthey can let it go without getting their opportunity to go through it because what they want is the experience at the other end. By the way, these people end up being either fascinating or deeply boring. If\nthey do not have an interesting life, what they tell you over and over again will drive you crazy.\n\nSelf-betraying nervousness in times of crisis. They know when the crisis is coming, they want to participate in the crisis and, when sometimes the excitement is too much for them, they let it out. When\nthey do so, my advice to these people is, \"Don't take a contraband across borders.\" That is a metaphor for many things. These people are probably the most honest people who create crisis. Sometimes, their\n\nPage 4\n\nhonesty gets them into trouble. They are the kind of people that will confess to someone and get themselves into trouble and have a crisis. They are inherently honest in that."

      "heading": "Justice",
      "raw": "Now we get to the sixth line, the line of transition, the top of the house. The 36.6 is looking towards the\n25.1. That is the next hexagram, the next line. The 25.1 is about selfless and motiveless action. All of this is deeply manipulative. This is depth, after all; we are looking at the mirror of the 48. It is an emotional\ndepth and understanding of the other operating in the wave but it is still an emotional grasp of the other and, because of that, there is so much built into the crisis that looks like it is manipulative.\n\nWhat they are looking for, in the end, is action that is without motive. \"I don't have to do this to get that.\"\nThe 35/36 is the channel of expectations. If I do this and this, I will get that. Then you'get to that and you realize, \"Shit, I have to start again,\" and on and on. This is an ongoing process. Expectation leads to\nfrustration. These people can get deeply disturbed by the fact that life does not reward you that way. You have to get out of the expectation business.\n\nThis line is called Justice ('just is'). The inevitable survival of right. Change is the only thing that endures.\nThe 32nd hexagram tells us that. To go from inexperience to experience is the human way. This is correct. Sixth lines are always looking for something else. This is looking far beyond the nature of the\nexperience. It is looking for what, in essence, all of this is bringing out in terms of the other side. What does the experience or the change lead to?\n\nSixth lines can be depressive. These people have seen it all before and they are the ones that are least likely to jump at experiences. Like the 59.6, the One Night Stand, they can end up being celibate because\nthey do not get the opportunity to see something that is transcendent, transitional for them. The next gate, the 25.1, is a spiritual gate. It is a mystical potential. This is where universal love starts. So they are\nlooking for something far beyond that.\n\nJupiter exalted. The knowledge and attendant faith that the powers of darkness eventually destroy themselves. 'Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad.' Saturn in detriment. A profound\nsorrow and cynicism that is not diminished by the understanding that darkness is self, annihilating.\n'Darkness' is ignorance. Madness looms as long as there is ignorance. Ignorance is the great darkness.\nHuman beings need to experience to make sense of what it is to be. We need the evidence. Not everything can be evidenced through the formula of the logic process. We need human experience. We need to know\nwhat it is like to have to go through and do things.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The correctness of crisis when it arises out of pure feelings. As long as the feelings are not pure, they will avoid the crisis. 36.6 people are not the kind of people that you associate with\ncrisis. When they do have them, they are huge. They are not crisis people because they are not turned on by any old experience. There is always this sense of \"What else is there?\"\n\nIn the detriment: The sorrow or cynicism that comes with seeing that despite the correctness of the feelings, there is always crisis. The deepest crisis is that the crisis goes nowhere, that the wheel keeps on\nturning, that the expectation is never fulfilled. Deep inside, they know that. What they are saying is, \"What is the sense of just going through this again? Why can't there be something different?\"\n\nOne of the great jokes that you will notice in the lines through the circuits, particularly in the collective, is that all the sixth lines in the logic want to be abstract and all the sixth lines of the abstract want to be\nlogical. The logic has this tendency to say in the end, \"Does this make sense?\" and the abstract has the tendency to say, \"Is it really true? Is it a fact?\" It is where they meet. The collective process is inside of\n\nPage 5\n\nus. We need all of those elements together. This sixth line can get very depressed due to its very nature: to be able to go through change to evolve, to continue this human process.\n\nThey are the people that are the strongest believers and the strongest desirers of the world coming to an end. They stand up and say, \"I hope it will all come to an end.\" I know a number of people who have that\nline and when Jupiter was struck by the comet Shoemaker Levy, they had this big grin on their faces.\n\"Oh, I hope it will come to an end.\"\n\nPage 6"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 36 DARKENING OF THE LIGHT\n\nWe come to the Darkening of the Light, to the 36th hexagram. We come to the beginning of our look at possibility gates. This is the possibility to release the emotional energy, the emotional wave. The 36th\nhexagram is by far the most powerful wave-releaser that we have. It has a direct access to the throat: the channel of Transitoriness, the design of a Jack of all trades, the design of the experiential way, the design\nof gaining experience.\n\nThis is all about the experiential path and this hexagram is enormously powerful in that. When people see that it is the gate of crisis, the thing to recognize is the nature of this gate and why there is crisis there.\n\nThis is gate of inexperience. It has been initiated by the 41st hexagram, which initiates the fantasy, the beginning of a possible new experience. It finally gets into the solar plex system in the 30 and there, it\nbecomes a feeling and a yearning to be able to fulfill the nature of that feeling. When it gets to the 36, that feeling is fully conceptualized in the emotional sense of the word. What is there is the readiness, the\ndepth, if you will. It is the mirror of the 48 (to attempt the experience and the deep frustration) and it is dependent on the presence of the 35 to release it, which puts the 35 under enormous pressure.\n\nThis is the human way. Because it is the gate of inexperience, what happens is that, regardless of what the experience is going to be, there is always a point of crisis, maybe a tiny crisis, maybe a huge crisis, but\ninexperience always leads to that. You can't help but make mistakes when you have never tried something before. You have to be very lucky to avoid that. In that sense, this is the nature of crisis here.\n\nThe awareness and power to generate a feeling or not: this is the energy to generate a feeling, to generate it outwards to drive an experience. In sexual terms, this is the gate of sexual penetration. This is the gate\nwhere you have to do it. By the time you get to the 36, you have to do it, whatever the experience is. You have all this energy built up in you so that you are prepared for it at any given moment. The change can\nbe so sudden, in that sense.\n\nThis awareness possibility is the hunger wave of hope and pain. Here, the frustration is very powerful. I must penetrate this experience. I must have this experience. This is the energy that is there and, of course,\nwhen you are hopeful it is like \"Yes, I get it.\" When you are full of pain it is, \"Why can't I get it?\" and the frustration that comes with that. What usually happens is that what you can't get from one source, you\nusually give to somebody else. It is not personal after all. This is the classic story of someone who is full of desire and they go looking for their lover and their lover is not home, and they find another one in the\nbar. This is strictly impersonal. This is simply about living out the experience. If there is nobody there for that experience, there will be someone else. That is why crisis is so common in this. It is not personal; it\njust pops out all the time.\n\nKeep in mind that the 36 is exactly opposite the 6, which generates the motor, and the 36 is its mirror.\nNothing generates a wave like the 36. It is quite an expressive thing to see it in motion.\n\n36.1 Resistance\n\nWhen you come to the first line, you come to the foundation and the line of introspection. More than anything else, all first lines, if you look at them, are very clear about describing the intrinsic nature of the\ngate.\n\nAbove the lines it says: The rule of cycles in which decline is a natural but not enduring stage. 'Decline,' in this sense, is the limitation of the inexperience. After all, these people are of enormous value to us.

The energy and determination to persevere in the face of opposition. The 'opposition' is the limitation. They are looking for the 35. Jupiter in detriment.

On one side you have: The emotional power to handle crisis. The 36th gate is about that. These people always handle their crisis. It is the other that has\nproblems with the crisis. They both have a crisis, but the 36th gate cruises through it and the other person has a shattering experience. It is very good for them. By the way, it is an ancient end-of-the -wheel gate. It\ncarries a lot of wisdom in that experience. So, every time you get shattered in crisis, there is something to be learned. There is a new birth that can take place.\n\nBy the very nature of the hexagram, they are equipped to handle the crisis, but on the other side: A resistance to change that will always bring crisis. On the other side, they realize how much that crisis\ncauses havoc. The people with the 36th gate that are part of my life are so aware of how much crisis they have brought. They know that. There is a part of them that says, \"I really did not have to do this thing\nbecause I am sure that it will lead to problems. Better I leave this.\" You can't do that until you have reached your midlife point. There are only few exceptions. After all, the 35/36 is a mirror of the 16/48,\nand they are both about talent and talent takes time.

In other words, no matter what their situation is, they can always move from inexperience to experience and always will, and damn the consequences. They are\nout there to get their experience. This is nature of what this hexagram is about.\n\nWhen you get to the other side, Mercury in detriment. A nervousness that can lead to self-betrayal. They can get very nervous because they know that the crisis is coming. They can feel it coming and sometimes\nthey can let it go without getting their opportunity to go through it because what they want is the experience at the other end. By the way, these people end up being either fascinating or deeply boring. If\nthey do not have an interesting life, what they tell you over and over again will drive you crazy.\n\nSelf-betraying nervousness in times of crisis. They know when the crisis is coming, they want to participate in the crisis and, when sometimes the excitement is too much for them, they let it out. When\nthey do so, my advice to these people is, \"Don't take a contraband across borders.\" That is a metaphor for many things. These people are probably the most honest people who create crisis. Sometimes, their\n\nPage 4\n\nhonesty gets them into trouble. They are the kind of people that will confess to someone and get themselves into trouble and have a crisis. They are inherently honest in that.\n\n36.6 Justice\n\nNow we get to the sixth line, the line of transition, the top of the house. The 36.6 is looking towards the\n25.1. That is the next hexagram, the next line. The 25.1 is about selfless and motiveless action. All of this is deeply manipulative. This is depth, after all; we are looking at the mirror of the 48. It is an emotional\ndepth and understanding of the other operating in the wave but it is still an emotional grasp of the other and, because of that, there is so much built into the crisis that looks like it is manipulative.\n\nWhat they are looking for, in the end, is action that is without motive. \"I don't have to do this to get that.\"\nThe 35/36 is the channel of expectations. If I do this and this, I will get that. Then you'get to that and you realize, \"Shit, I have to start again,\" and on and on. This is an ongoing process. Expectation leads to\nfrustration. These people can get deeply disturbed by the fact that life does not reward you that way. You have to get out of the expectation business.\n\nThis line is called Justice ('just is'). The inevitable survival of right. Change is the only thing that endures.\nThe 32nd hexagram tells us that. To go from inexperience to experience is the human way. This is correct. Sixth lines are always looking for something else. This is looking far beyond the nature of the\nexperience. It is looking for what, in essence, all of this is bringing out in terms of the other side. What does the experience or the change lead to?\n\nSixth lines can be depressive. These people have seen it all before and they are the ones that are least likely to jump at experiences. Like the 59.6, the One Night Stand, they can end up being celibate because\nthey do not get the opportunity to see something that is transcendent, transitional for them. The next gate, the 25.1, is a spiritual gate. It is a mystical potential. This is where universal love starts. So they are\nlooking for something far beyond that.\n\nJupiter exalted. The knowledge and attendant faith that the powers of darkness eventually destroy themselves. 'Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad.' Saturn in detriment. A profound\nsorrow and cynicism that is not diminished by the understanding that darkness is self, annihilating.\n'Darkness' is ignorance. Madness looms as long as there is ignorance. Ignorance is the great darkness.\nHuman beings need to experience to make sense of what it is to be. We need the evidence. Not everything can be evidenced through the formula of the logic process. We need human experience. We need to know\nwhat it is like to have to go through and do things.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The correctness of crisis when it arises out of pure feelings. As long as the feelings are not pure, they will avoid the crisis. 36.6 people are not the kind of people that you associate with\ncrisis. When they do have them, they are huge. They are not crisis people because they are not turned on by any old experience. There is always this sense of \"What else is there?\"\n\nIn the detriment: The sorrow or cynicism that comes with seeing that despite the correctness of the feelings, there is always crisis. The deepest crisis is that the crisis goes nowhere, that the wheel keeps on\nturning, that the expectation is never fulfilled. Deep inside, they know that. What they are saying is, \"What is the sense of just going through this again? Why can't there be something different?\"\n\nOne of the great jokes that you will notice in the lines through the circuits, particularly in the collective, is that all the sixth lines in the logic want to be abstract and all the sixth lines of the abstract want to be\nlogical. The logic has this tendency to say in the end, \"Does this make sense?\" and the abstract has the tendency to say, \"Is it really true? Is it a fact?\" It is where they meet. The collective process is inside of\n\nPage 5\n\nus. We need all of those elements together. This sixth line can get very depressed due to its very nature: to be able to go through change to evolve, to continue this human process.\n\nThey are the people that are the strongest believers and the strongest desirers of the world coming to an end. They stand up and say, \"I hope it will all come to an end.\" I know a number of people who have that\nline and when Jupiter was struck by the comet Shoemaker Levy, they had this big grin on their faces.\n\"Oh, I hope it will come to an end.\"\n\nPage 6",

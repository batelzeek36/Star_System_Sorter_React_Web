  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 56 THE WANDERER\n\nThe throat center is the most complex of all the centers for a very obvious reason. It has eleven gates and it represents our capacity to metamorphose. In that sense, it contains within it a potential for all of us to\nmanifest in this life. It contains the themes of manifestation that we have in this life. The Wanderer is one of the primary gates in the throat center that provides an outlet for the mind. One of the things to\nunderstand about the nature of the mind is that it is there to be able to conceptualize the nature of what it is to be in the world as a human being. One of the first things you learn in Human Design is that the mind\nhas no capacity to dictate the nature of your life, but it is very good in taking a look at your life and at others' lives.\n\nThe 56 is one of the two collective gates of communication. These are metamorphic gates and operate in a very unusual fashion. They translate inner vision, the visual capacity within us to conceptualize by seeing\ninside, into what we call language. These gates are very special gates because they contain within them our capacity to communicate with each other as human beings and to get the other to be able to see what\nwe mean. These gates are translators, in a way. They are trying to transform an inner vision, an inner seeing, into language. The 56th gate is the voice of the mental abstract process.\n\nThe gates of the throat have a voice. The voice of the 56th gate is a voice that is either hopeful or desperate because it is the voice of belief. It is the voice that says \"I believe\" or \"I don't believe\". The 56th\ngate is a gate of stimulation. One of the jokes is that the 56th gate, in terms of genetics, is a stop codon.\nLiterally, the point of stimulation is the point in which you stop. In other words, you can tell a story but do not try to live out the story that you believe in.\n\nThis 56th gate is a very important gate because, without this gate, we do not have a human learning process. This is a key to understand its importance. Everything about the abstract process is about the\nexperiential path, which is loaded with crisis, mistakes and problems, cycles, beginnings, middles and ends. Without this path, we do not have a history and we do not have philosophy and we do not have the\nreflection upon our experience that gives us a sense of the truth of what it is to be us.\n\nThe 56th gate is there to stimulate us with its storytelling. It is there to be able to take the images of its mind that we call 'ideas' on the abstract side, to take the ideas and bring them into a form as a story. So,\nwhen that story is told, you see that idea within yourself and you can make sense out of it.\n\nThe stimulation: this gate has a great deal to do with our ability to advance as a civilization. That is, we collect more and more information out of our experiences. We code that information and put it into books\nand computers so that every single generation benefits from the experiences of the previous generation.\nThere are no other animals like that. This is something very unique in us. This is a process that comes out of this gate.\n\nIt says, in the Book of Letters: Manifestation as a verbal description of realization or not. What has been realized at the mental level then can be verbalized. Above the lines in the black book it says: Stability\nthrough movement. This is something very important to understand about the nature of ideas. The channel\n1 1/56 is the channel of Curiosity. It is a design of a searcher and a seeker. There is nothing in it that says that it is the design of finding the truth. It doesn't say: This is a design of finding an absolute. It is the\ndesign of a searcher and a seeker, and anybody who has that channel is going to spend their whole life searching and seeking because that is exactly what they do, no matter what they find. So, stability through\nmovement. The moment one recognizes that ideas and beliefs and stimulation are transitory, that is the moment that you are seeing the true nature of what this gate is.\n\nPage 1\n\nThe perpetuation of continuity through the linking of short term activity. Ideas are there to be explored, to be shared. They are there to be able to stimulate others. Don't get stuck in this mental process of saying \"I\nhave an idea,\" or that an idea is supposed to turn into what you invest your money in, your heart in, your life in. It is not about that. This is a gate of pure stimulation, to communicate to the other the story that\nyou have, whatever that story may be. \"You know what happened to me yesterday?\" That is the 56th gate, and you can believe it or not.\n\n56.1 Quality\n\nThis first line is called Quality. We know that all first lines are introspective by their very nature. Here, you get the essence of what stimulation is all about.\n\nMoon exalted. The practical sense that even short term activities should be of value. What that is really saying is here in the white book: Expression of practical ideas that have value. This is all about using this\ncapacity to stimulate others with ideas that are of value, reflections that are of value and not just any old thing. The 56 just wants to stimulate. After all, it is not aware. It is a throat mechanic. What it needs to do\nis to constantly stimulate. But the reality is that the feedback is necessary. You need those who are really interested in that, who will believe in that, who will be stimulated by that. So, the importance is that\nwhatever you are stimulating with should have value itself. The other thing is that when you are working with an idea, when you are overtaken by an idea, you have to go through the whole idea before you can\njump and go to the next one. That is the other side of the coin.\n\nMars in detriment. Whenever you see Mars, you know that you have a certain level of immaturity that exists. So on the other side of this line, there is a lot of immaturity built into that process of stimulation.\n\"Let me stimulate you. Don't you believe me? This is me.\" There is the need to have the collective accept that process, and the Mars is: The ego drive to make an impression that will misuse energy in trivial\npursuits. This is somebody who does not care what the quality of the concept is. They are only interested in getting out their stimulation and they try to stimulate people with anything, just to be able to get this\nfeedback.\n\nIn the white book: The drive to stimulate that will express any idea, no matter how trivial. Understand that this is the basis of what stimulation is all about. On one side, there is this clear recognition that the only\nthings worth stimulating others with are things of value. There is no point telling somebody about this great idea of thermo-nuclear physics if it does not mean anything to them. It has to be of value to them;\notherwise, you are not successfully going to stimulate them.\n\nBut the tendency in this gate is simply to want to stimulate for the sake of stimulating. This is always going to run into difficulties because first lines do not know anything about the other side. The 56 wants\nto be able to stimulate but it does not really understand the idea in the first place. It just wants to be able to stimulate. This is why 56's become the great believers and disbelievers. They go through this whole\nprocess of belief and disbelief. The moment that they are trying to get people to believe in their stimulation, they discover that they themselves do not believe in it. The moment that you get into the\ntrivial side of stimulation, you are always running into backlash from people because they are not going to believe you.\n\n56.2 Linkage\n\nThe 56th hexagram contains two lines that use the word 'genius.' Genius is mentioned six times out of 384 lines, so there is a great potential for the very unusual. Both of these lines, the second and the fifth, are in\nresonance to each other and they are both exalted by Uranus. There is an extraordinary quality of unusualness that can exist in this stimulation and it can be of enormous value at a deep intellectual level.\n\nPage 2\n\nWhenever we are dealing with a second line, always remember that these first three lines are not well equipped to deal with the other side. The other side in this case is the idea itself.\n\nWhen you are dealing with the second line, you are always dealing with projection. Every second line that you have is projecting the quality of that hexagram out into the world, but you do not necessarily have the\ndepth. First lines are always busy finding their foundation, but second lines are just projecting it out with no way of looking inside.\n\nThink about what that is like for somebody who is a stimulator. If you have the 56.2, you are always projecting out that you can stimulate others. So they come into your aura waiting to be stimulated and\neither you can or you can't. You don't really know. You are just projecting out this field in you to others that you are the one that can stimulate them. Maybe you can; maybe you can't.\n\nLinkage. Uranus exalted. Isolated genius that will eventually find continuity through recognition and support. It is isolated because this is a genius for stimulation in which the awareness or depth is unknown.\nHere is somebody that has a gift within them, potentially, to be very stimulating for others, but they do not really know that they have that gift. And it may not happen now and not tomorrow, it may show up\nsometime, somewhere down the track. It can happen three days before you die, when you are 92; or it can happen right away.\n\nIt also means that it is something that will occur. The person that has the second line, that is projecting outwards, they really need somebody to come into their aura, recognize their gift and say, \"Wow. You can\nreally stimulate others,\" and the second line will say, \"Really? Do you think so?\" Because they do not know that they have that depth.\n\nIn the white book: A genius for stimulating expression that will take time to mature and will need others to recognize it. What that means is if you have a child that has the 56.2, you need to recognize that you\nneed to encourage them to see that they have this power to stimulate. Otherwise, they get found out at an early age and they can forever hold back that gift within them. Anytime that you see a second line in\nsomebody's chart, you know that is a place where you can go to them and provide them with what they need, that is, the recognition that what they are projecting out is also real underneath. These people do not\nknow that. They recognize their own projection going out but they do not really know, and underneath that can lie a great deal of insecurity.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. Asuperficiality... (Again, this is a projected field. There is no genuine depth in that.) ...which collapses under recognition and is eventually forced to move on. The inability to know\nwhether you can really stimulate others or not always puts that person in that position of having that test.\nSomebody comes and says, \"Okay, stimulate me. Go ahead. I dare you.\" If you can't, of course, there is the collapse.\n\nA gift for communicating, but not enough depth. So the 56.2's have to recognize that it will take them time to be able to really be secure in their communicating gift. The best for them, by the way, is the\nresonance of the 1 1 .2 or 1 1 .5 in people or transits that they meet.\n\n56.3 Alienation\n\nWhen you get to the third line, to the completion of the lower trigram, you are dealing with the concept or terminology of adaptation. Everything about the nature of the third line is about the recognition that it\ninvolves a process that we call trial and error. This is a wave of bonds made or broken, and this is the learning process in life. Nothing distinguishes the third line more than this process of: you can't do it. It\n\nPage 3\n\ndoes not work. You try it again in another way. It does not work. You go through this process of trial and error.\n\nHere the trial and error is called Alienation. It says: Determined self-sufficiency. Understand something.\nIt is very difficult for somebody with the 56th gate to be self-sufficient. They are dependent on the ideas and the concepts coming from the 11th gate and they are forced to adapt. Yet, at the same time, the 56th\ngate, because it is a metamorphic gate in the throat, needs to be the one that does the expressing. The self- sufficiency in the third line is, \"I want to be the one that does the speaking.\" This is the need to be the\nstimulator. There still is not a clear understanding that there is something on the other side of the channel that they are going to have to make a deal with, that they are going to have to work out an arrangement\nwith. There is still this inner sense of simply, \"I am a stimulator and, because of that, I do not want anybody to interfere with my stimulation.\" Out of that comes all this trial and error.\n\nSun exalted. A will and egoism that often proves overbearing and guarantees continued isolation. Here, this is acceptable, given the Sun's intrinsic vitality. Or, as the white book says: The drive to control and be\nthe focus of expression. It is very clear to the 56.3 that they can really express themselves and stimulate others, but they do not want to be interfered with because the moment that they are interfered with, they\nhave to start all over again. \"Ah, I can't do it this way. I have to do it that way. I can't stimulate them this way. I will stimulate them that way.\" Because they want to do it their own way, they often offend other\npeople who are there as part of their process.\n\nOn the other side of this, Venus in detriment. The reversed aesthetic that offends others, ensures isolation and eliminates support. \"I do the talking here. I do the stimulating here, and not you. Don't interfere with\nmy stimulation. Don't interfere with my belief system. You don't believe in me? Then I don't want to have anything to do with you. You are wrong and I am right.\" The mistakes that are made out of concepts:\nthere are so many people running around who have ideas in their head that they really think are absolutes.\nIf they have the third line, they will stand there and scream as loud as they can, \"Marx is great.\" He had the 11th gate. Very nice. But the reality is that they can scream so loud and not hear, not take in from\nothers, so that they can really offend others.\n\nMy constant warning to you: Do not get caught up in making a moralistic judgment about whether this line is good or bad. It is not about that. It is a process. The third line has a resonance in the sixth line,\nwhich has a potential for wisdom. Wisdom can only come about through trial and error as a process in life. If you never make mistakes in this life, you can never be wise. That is a basic formula.\n\nThis third line, though it may alienate a lot of people, the person that is doing all the alienating may eventually get to a point of real wisdom about what to stimulate and what not to stimulate with. They\nfinally learn how to adapt to others. The first three lines are always at this disadvantage that they are not transpersonal. They do not really understand what is on the other side. They have to go through their own\nprocess and in that they can always be alienating.\n\nPeople who have the first line, you do not really know whether they are there or not. They are not showing you anything out of that first line. You have to go digging for that. They are into their own\nprocess. The second line is pushing all this out but you do not know what is underneath and they are not capable of that. The third line is ready to adapt but it does not know what to adapt to because it does not\nknow where it is going to come from. They are involved in their own processes.\n\nThe drive to control the expression at the expense of stimulation. \"Don't interfere with me. I will not tell you anything unless you are quiet.\" A friend of mine, many years ago, was a teacher and he had the 56.3.\nHe was the kind of person who will stand in front of a class and say, \"If you are not quiet, I will not teach\n\nPage 4\n\nyou.\" This is the 56.3. You have to control everything first and some people do not want to be controlled.\n\"I will not be quiet. I am not interested in what you have to say. You are not very interesting.\" And all of a sudden, that person has to adapt and they do not want to adapt. They want to be in control and start\nscreaming, \"Shut up. I am talking.\" It can be quite a process until they learn.\"\n\nEvery time that you see the collective channels being completely defined in the mind, you know that these people are close to being impossible in terms of trying to get through their fixedness. That is their gift\nafter all: they are here to have both ends fixed and they have a very specialized process but, because of that, it is very hard to get in. It takes time. It will be a longer process for them to be able to go through an\nadaptation. If you have the 56.3 connected to the 11, it is difficult for you to learn to adapt because you are so fixed on your own ideas that you are not open to the possibility of adaptation.\n\n56.4 Expediency\n\nNow, we come to the fourth line in the upper trigram. The 1 1 .4 is called The Teacher and it is an exalted line. Our evolutionary process was changed by a mutation that took place in the axis of the 11.4 and the\n12.4. The 12.4 is The Prophet, the arousing of the stagnant. It opened up the communicating capability in our throat. The opposition to that is the 1 1 A, The Teacher.\n\nThis line is broken up into three possibilities: the teacher, the guru and the sage: all of the possibilities for being able to communicate philosophical and conceptual ideas. Here, when you are looking at the fourth\nline, you are looking at the direct resonance to this very important line of being able to teach. In the fourth line, we are dealing with a process of externalization. This is the beginning of a process that is\ntranspersonal. The fourth line realizes that there is an idea on the other end and, in order for the 56.4 to be a good stimulator, they have to be able to handle the idea at the other end and externalize it. This\nexternalization is about being focused and being very clear that this is the thing that you have to push across. They can be really one -tracked in their process.\n\nThe other thing to recognize about all fourth lines is that they are rooted in the concept of opportunism.\nAll fourth lines only get to externalize at the right moment and if they try to externalize with the wrong timing, it does not really work very well for them because they are very fixed.\n\nThis fourth line is called Expediency. The perfection of the superficial personality that can mask, when essential, its true feelings to secure protection. Imagine that the 56 is a microphone and the 1 1 with the\nideas is the voice. The microphone is not interested in taking on the persona of the 1 1 . It is a mask. It is simply going to release the information. It is very important to understand that in this fourth line is the\nultimate storyteller who tells stories as a role. It is superficial. This is somebody that is just a good storyteller and in that role of being a storyteller, they can stimulate you and get the idea across.\n\nIf I were to do the chart of Jesus, if that was possible, I am sure that I would find the 56.4 because this is the line of telling parables, of telling stories to get your message across. It is not that you believe in your\nown story. Please understand that. There is an old joke about a family sitting together and the father is telling a story, and the child finally interrupts and it says, \"Papa, is this true?\" and this mother slaps him\non the back of his head and says, \"Don't interrupt your father.\n\nHe is telling a story.\" The magic of this line is: do not believe your own story. Recognize what the story is for. The story is a delivery system. To be the storyteller is a mold to deliver it.\n\nMercury in detriment. Expedient behavior whose price is a constant stressful alertness and nervous anxiety in fear of losing what has been gained. These people believe in their own stories. Instead of telling\n\nPage 5\n\na story to stimulate you, they will put themselves into that story, a lie in that sense, and believe that story themselves. These are the kind of people that get caught up in all of that.\n\nThe role as reality. The fear of silence and of being uncovered. In other words, these are people that will use storytelling to try to make sure that everybody notices who they are. And because they use\nstorytelling to be noticed, they will lie in that storytelling. They go in for their job and they say, \"Yes, I have done this for many years and I know this very well,\" and in that moment of doing that they believe it\nthemselves. After all, this is all about believing.\n\nThose people that get caught up in their own story and start believing in their own story always end up being challenged. There is no question about that. And those who simply come out with the storytelling as\nthe way to get the information across show the other side of the capacity. In both cases you have people that must stimulate others, and this is the underlying force. It is a fourth line. It is a line of externalization.\nIt is a driving force in their process. The key is: wait for the opportunities. That is true for every fourth line.\n\n56.5 Attracting attention\n\nEverything about these gates of primary communication is not to forget that that is what they are. They are not gates of action. They are only gates of communication. What happens so often to people who have\na gift to stimulate is that they think that this gift automatically means the ability to turn it into action. That is not true. The gift of being able to stimulate, to tell stories and the value of the 56 is about sharing what\nit is to be human with others. Our whole mental process is so that we can come to grips with what it is to be a human being and live in this world. It is not about dictating what we do. Every time I do somebody's\nreading, I am always telling people the same thing. The mind can't tell you what to do. It does not matter whether it is defined or undefined, connected to the throat or not. It does not make any damn difference. It\nis not going to be able to tell you what to do and it is never going to work for you. The mind does not do that. That is not its job. Its job is not to tell us what to do but to examine the nature of our doing, to look at\nour process.\n\nThis stimulation is not about getting people to do something. It is there to share in the awareness of what it is to be human. That is what it is about. Because we live on the mental plane and all of you have been\ndeeply conditioned to think that what you think is what you should do, or what you would like to think is what you would like to do and all of the things that go with it, we end up in this horrible place in which\nhuman beings don't live out what they do, and they take these ideas seriously as a game plan for life. \"I have this wonderful idea. Why don't we all jump off this side of the bridge and see how many of us\nsurvive?\" Well, very nice. An idea is not necessarily something that requires any kind of doing. Ideas are about stimulating each other about the nature of what it is to be here in the world.\n\nWhen you get to the fifth line, you get to universalization. The way the world sees this gate of stimulation is that they see it as something that attracts attention, and that's what it does. This is the line of Attracting\nattention. Here, again we have the resonance to the second line. In the second line we see that all second line people are projecting out without necessarily knowing the depth underneath, and all fifth line people\nare being projected on. If you are a 56.5, every time that somebody comes into your aura, their projection is that you are a storyteller. That may or may not be true, but that is their projection on you. Their\nprojection is that you are the stimulator, you are the storyteller.\n\nYou know what this is like. You have a dinner party and you want to make sure that somebody is there who keeps everybody talking. You will always pick a fifth line because they are the ones you project on.\n\"This one is okay. This one is very stimulating.\" It is a projection but that does not mean that underneath that projection is no power. If you have a fifth line, wherever it is, the outside world will project onto that.\n\nPage 6\n\nThat means something very special. What that means is that the outside will give you an opportunity to tell your story and if you are a lousy storyteller, too bad. But the outside world will give you that\nopportunity because they will project on you that you are the stimulator and that you have a story to tell them.\n\nUranus exalted. Unusualness, innovation and sometimes genius as guarantees of eventually attracting attention and support. The opportunity is always there. Genetically, it is built in. This is, after all, a\nstimulating, storytelling gate. The capacity is there. It just may not be the right stimulation, but nonetheless, everybody is going to come and project on that. In the white book: Stimulation at its most\ninnovative and unusual.\n\nMars in detriment: All too often a tendency to attract attention that is self-defeating in its effects. What happens so often, when you go through the lines and these kinds of statements, is that we take them into\nour minds in the context of our lives at the present time. But please understand that this is a process of coming into the world, being born with this kind of a line and going through the development of your\ninfancy, your childhood, your whole aging process. It can be very difficult when you are a child because everybody projects on you. This is the kind of child (with the 56.5) that comes into the classroom late and\nstarts to give an excuse of why they are late, and the teacher is not going to believe it. The teacher will project onto this child: this child is a storyteller and it may or may not tell me the truth. You have to have\na really good story. So, this projection gives you an opportunity but at the same time, it can pull the rug out from underneath your feet. That is the other side to see about it.\n\nEvery time that you have a fifth line, you have to recognize that the more you mature into the nature of that hexagram (it takes time, all these processes take time), you get to a point where, at that moment of\nprojection on you, you are genuinely ready to respond. There is a gift that lies in here but there is always that pressure of projection. This is a line where it is very difficult for people who are intrinsic liars. The\nmoment you have an intrinsic genetic liar, and we have gates that bring out this quality, then you have somebody that will be projected on all of their life that they are just simply a storyteller and they are not\nto be believed. After all, nothing the 5 wants more than to be believed. \"Do you believe me? Please, believe in me.\" They want you to believe in them and everybody who comes to these people wants to\nbelieve in them. \"I want to believe that you are telling me the truth but my projection says that you are lying.\" This is part of the process that the 5 has to deal with.\n\nThe power of stimulation to provoke and disturb. The moment that you have a projected force on you, people come with their projection, which means that they do not see you; so, depending on what you\nbring back to them, they can be made quite uncomfortable in that process. Everything about what we consider stimulation is hooked into this. We have the tradition throughout our history of the traveling\nstoryteller. Now, we live in the world of online and internet storytelling, of television and film, which is all part of this archetype of attracting attention.\n\n56.6 Caution\n\nWhen you get to the sixth line, you get to the end of a process. This sixth line, like all sixth lines, does not really have anything to do with the hexagram itself. It is already beyond that process. It is like the roof of\na house. You are looking out over the top and you do not get to see anymore what is inside because you have been through that process and you are looking out for what is beyond all that. When you are dealing\nwith a gate of stimulation and you come to the sixth line, that is somebody who may stimulate you or not.\n\nThe frequency wave of all sixth lines is a wave that we call trust or not. It is about trust. Every sixth line is no longer simply interested in what is the harmonic gate at the other end of the channel but all sixth\nlines are looking at the entire process. They are looking towards the whole circuit. They are not just\n\nPage 7\n\ninterested in an idea, they want to know where the ideas will go, what it will cost in terms of time, energy and spirit. What kind of change and crisis will it bring? Will it bring success of not? Can it have a\nbeginning, a middle and an end? Is it really worthwhile doing it? The sixth line is caught up in trying to see: is it really worth it? Why should I bother to stimulate anyone if that stimulation is not going to get to\nthis and that?\n\nWhen you come to the abstract process, you come to a process rooted in expectation. Every time you look at somebody's chart and you see a gate that is part of the abstract circuit, you know right away that in that\ngate, you have all this expectation. It is the expectation that if I do this, I am going to get that. This expectation can be a very painful process because there is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever, that if you\ndo step 1, 2, 3 and 4, they will give you your reward. The 56.6 says, \"I know. I really do. If I stimulate, I do expect to have this and that and, quite frankly, from my experience, I don't see that because every time\nI stimulate it goes like this or that, but it does not really bring all of that.\" So when you get to the sixth line, it is not like you are saying, \"Aha, here is somebody that is going to stimulate us.\" Maybe they never\nsay a word to you. Instead of this being someone that can express, \"I believe\", they may believe in nothing at all because they are looking for something else. They are looking for more than just simply\nanother idea. What is built into this is the fact that this line, more than any other line, is open to every single kind of idea that you can imagine. Everything. Open to the whole field of possible stimulation and\ndue to that, they may stimulate nothing at all.\n\nCaution. The prudence, when linkage has been achieved, to honor its new commitments in order to secure its footing. Literally, what that says is that the moment you connect to an idea, if you are really going to\nstimulate with that, you have to stay with the whole process. You have to go through the whole thing.\nYou have to see how the whole thing works out.\n\nHonesty in expression. Living by one's word. It is very difficult to be an abstract person and to live by your word. This is somebody that wants to be able to know that what they are telling other people to\nbelieve in, they believe in themselves. If you go to the 10.6, you see that in all sixth lines the hidden behavior is always about the question, \"Are we hypocrites, or not? How can we be a role model if we are\nhypocritical in that role?\" This sixth line here is dealing with the same process. \"I am not just going to stimulate somebody because I can. I will stimulate them with something that is true to my own spirit, so\nthat I am not a hypocrite.\" Very hard to do because ideas are unstable by their very nature. It is not easy to find an idea that you can live with. You look in your lives and see how many ideas have survived that you\nhave carried inside of you. They come and they go. The 56.6 knows this.\n\nAt the other end of this, you have Pluto in detriment. A very powerful Pluto transit and we have all kinds of people from 1939 to 1941 that carry this Pluto in 56. The profound unconscious wanderer, where\nexternal yearning for acceptance will unconsciously release the exact energy that creates rejection. A difficult role, where the self is unknown and not recognized with predictable results. In the white book:\nWandering throughout the life from one expression to the next, unable to find the stimulation that one could live by.\n\nEvery single person that carries this energy, they will travel their whole life through every kind of possible idea. They will go through everything to try to find the one idea that they can really live with.\nUntil then, other than when they are young, they will stop stimulating other people with these ideas.\nWhen they get to a point where they recognize that no idea is good enough for them, they become anti- stimulating. Somebody comes up to them and says, \"I have this great idea,\" and the 56.6 answers, \"I have\nheard it. I am not interested. I know that stuff. I know that philosophy. I know that school of thought. I know those ideas. I know that way. It is not something that I can live with.\"\n\nPage 8\n\nLiving with it does not mean living with it in the moment; it is about being able to live with it throughout your life because you have to constantly go back and reflect on it, to see clearly that it has been of value\nfor you. There are so many people I know of that generation (around 1940) who have gone through so many concepts in their process, and so many of them end up deeply disillusioned because they get to this\nsense that there is no idea that they can really live by because ideas are, by their very nature, transitory.\n\nWhen you get to the sixth line, you can see the magic of the wheel. When you get to the 56.6, you are moving in the wheel to the 31.1. The next gate you come to is the gate of Influence, a logical gate to\nguide humanity and order humanity into the future. The 56.6 is an abstract gate, designed to reflect on the past; that sixth line is saying, \"I do not want ideas. I want something that I can live by, so that I can\nstimulate others and have a valid influence on their lives in the future.\"\n\nThis is where the great confusion comes from. So many people think that ideas are things that we need to have in the future. Ideas are there to examine the past. Only logic can project into the future. The abstract\nis there to reflect on the post, and this 56.6 is sitting on that cusp and it is saying, \"Yes, but these ideas that come out of my past experience, unless they are of value to humanity in the future, unless they are of\nvalue to me in the future, I am not going to be involved with any of them. They step out of the idea business.\n\nYou can also see this magic because you go from a primary gate of communication in the 56.6 to a primary gate of identity in the 31.1. The 56.6 is deeply concerned about its identity because only ideas\nthat are really of value in life allow them to have an intellectual identity that feels good. It goes immediately to a gate of identity and trying to find that identity. This is why idea people always want to\nbe leaders. They are not equipped.\n\nThe frequency wave of all sixth lines is a wave that we call trust or not. It is about trust. Every sixth line is no longer simply interested in what is the harmonic gate at the other end of the channel but all sixth lines are\nlooking at the entire process. They are looking towards the whole circuit. They are not just interested in an idea, they want to know where the ideas will go, what it will cost in terms of time, energy and spirit. What kind of\nchange and crisis will it bring? Will it bring success of not? Can it have a beginning, a middle and an end? Is it really worthwhile doing it? The sixth line is caught up in trying to see: is it really worth it? Why should I bother to\nstimulate anyone if that stimulation is not going to get to this and that?\n\nWhen you come to the abstract process, you come to a process rooted in expectation. Every time you look at somebody's chart and you see a gate that is part of the abstract circuit, you know right away that in that gate,\nyou have all this expectation. It is the expectation that if I do this, I am going to get that. This expectation can be a very painful process because there is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever, that if you do step 1, 2, 3 and\n4, they will give you your reward. The 56.6 says, \"I know. I really do. If I stimulate, I do expect to have this and that and, quite frankly, from my experience, I don't see that because every time I stimulate it goes like this or\nthat, but it does not really bring all of that.\" So when you get to the sixth line, it is not like you are saying, \"Aha, here is somebody that is going to stimulate us.\" Maybe they never say a word to you. Instead of this being\nsomeone that can express, \"I believe\", they may believe in nothing at all because they are looking for something else. They are looking for more than just simply another idea. What is built into this is the fact that\nthis line, more than any other line, is open to every single kind of idea that you can imagine. Everything. Open to the whole field of possible stimulation and due to that, they may stimulate nothing at all.\n\nCaution. The prudence, when linkage has been achieved, to honor its new commitments in order to secure its footing. Literally, what that says is that the moment you connect to an idea, if you are really going to stimulate\n\nPage 9\n\nwith that, you have to stay with the whole process. You have to go through the whole thing. You have to see how the whole thing works out.\n\nHonesty in expression. Living by one's word. It is very difficult to be an abstract person and to live by your word. This is somebody that wants to be able to know that what they are telling other people to\nbelieve in, they believe in themselves. If you go to the 10.6, you see that in all sixth lines the hidden behavior is always about the question, \"Are we hypocrites, or not? How can we be a role model if we are\nhypocritical in that role?\" This sixth line here is dealing with the same process. \"I am not just going to stimulate somebody because I can. I will stimulate them with something that is true to my own spirit, so\nthat I am not a hypocrite.\" Very hard to do because ideas are unstable by their very nature. It is not easy to find an idea that you can live with. You look in your lives and see how many ideas have survived that you\nhave carried inside of you. They come and they go. The 56.6 knows this.\n\nAt the other end of this, you have Pluto in detriment. A very powerful Pluto transit and we have all kinds of people from 1939 to 1941 that carry this Pluto in 56. The profound unconscious wanderer, where\nexternal yearning for acceptance will unconsciously release the exact energy that creates rejection. A difficult role, where the self is unknown and not recognized with predictable results. In the white book:\nWandering throughout the life from one expression to the next, unable to find the stimulation that one could live by.\n\nEvery single person that carries this energy, they will travel their whole life through every kind of possible idea. They will go through everything to try to find the one idea that they can really live with.\nUntil then, other than when they are young, they will stop stimulating other people with these ideas.\nWhen they get to a point where they recognize that no idea is good enough for them, they become anti- stimulating. Somebody comes up to them and says, \"I have this great idea,\" and the 56.6 answers, \"I have\nheard it. I am not interested. I know that stuff. I know that philosophy. I know that school of thought. I know those ideas. I know that way. It is not something that I can live with.\"\n\nPage 10",

This\nfear brings to the 44th gate this sense of, \"Oh, this ego is very powerful and I can get carried away on its energy.\" After all, the 44th hexagram is about dominating, being able to manage the ego power at the\nother end. The ego is not aware, but it is a motor and the 44 would like to have contact to that motor because it is healthy and turns on the system.

Due to that resonance, you know that being a people manager is a deep theme that already matured by the time that\nyou get to the fourth line. The fourth line is an externalization line and, therefore, has a single track. It is deeply fixed on one aspect. Here, this aspect is called Honesty. It says: The refusal to engage in\nhypocritical interaction. These are people whose management style is considered to be straight forward.\nThey are very direct.\n\nPluto exalted. Indifference at its most logical and cutting. The indifference is to the needs of the individual. After all, this is taking the people-manager resonance from the first line. There is this deep\nindifference to all this stuff about having to work really hard to make sure that the other is really comfortable with all this.\n\nBy the time you get to the fourth line, you know that there is something on the other side and the only way the fourth line is able to work with them is that it is very direct with them.\n\nThe Sun in detriment, that in extreme situations, in cases of self-sustainment, will expect assistance from forces it has totally rejected. Here the honesty is the genuine need. You want to do business with\nsomebody and, being a fourth line, you are very direct and say, \"Look, I am not in the ABC business, I am in the XYZ business, go away.\" Two years later, you discover that you want to get into the ABC\nbusiness and you call up the very people you rejected and you can actually say to them, \"Why don't you come over and we'll talk. Now, I am interested in the ABC business.\" This is all about being direct. This\n\nPage 4\n\ndirectness can seem obsessive because there is nothing else there. They can only be focused in that honesty, in that one transformation that they want to bring about.\n\nThe indifference possible when guided by the instinctive memory. In other words, you really know the type, so why mess around? Put it straight to them.\n\nOn the other side: The sacrifice of indifference for survival.

      "heading": "Manipulation",
      "raw": "The fifth line is the finish of the hexagram process. Here you have the completion of what the hexagram is all about. Within the hexagram, you have the ability to universalize the process. Please understand in\nthis sense that the 44/26 represents the immune system of the tribe. It is the defense system for the tribe. It is what keeps the tribe healthy. This material reality, this fifth line, represents literally what that is all\nabout: what is going to keep the tribe immune from disease, immune from failure at the material level.\nThe 32nd gate was the fear of failure and the 44th gate is the fear of the past and they are trying to overcome those fears through having material success in the present.\n\nThe fifth line is called Manipulation. The ability to transform interaction with inferior elements into the energizing of progressive processes with the additional benefit that, in tapping the inferior elements, they\nremain weak. Think about the nature of that. That is, you cannot have everybody climb the ladder of the hierarchy. This does not work and yet, at the same time, inferior elements being part of the tribe need to\nhave their sustenance, need to be protected and need to have a sense of self-worth within the community.\n\nThe gift of this sort of manipulation is to integrate these forces into the operation and allow them to have their place by making them comfortable through the manipulating style of the personnel manager and, at\nthe same time, have them be satisfied that they will spend 55 years plugging bolds into the side of a car.\nThis is absolutely essential on this planet. Otherwise things fall apart.\n\nOn the other side of this, Mars in detriment. The tendency in this form of manipulation to become abusive and degenerate to their level. This is the dictatorial fiat. This is the need for control in the 32nd gate. Here,\nin the detriment of the fifth line of the 44, it becomes the power trip. \"I have the power and you don't.\nYou do what you are told.\" I can be very abusive.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: Where the instinctive recognitions of the patterns leads to the possible manipulation of others. Again, manipulation without any negative connotation. Without a proper\nhierarchy, there is no success. I have grown up in North America which was rooted in the idea that the traditional hierarchical caste systems could be replaced, so that they would throw away the ideas of\nmonarchy and institute republics. If you go to North America today, they simply replaced that with the monetary class system: how much money you make. The moment they meet you, they want to know how\nmuch money you make because then they can put you into a place within the hierarchy.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that, if you are working for a company and you are getting well paid relative to what you do, you don't mind that the CEO is taking home two million dollars. It astonishes me how many\nemployees find it quite normal that the boss is making this enormous fortune while they are slaving for forty-eight hours a week. However, this is natural to us. This is our way. We are animals. Animals are all\nhierarchical, no matter how sophisticated we look as a patina on the surface. Everything is about hierarchy, and it will not go away. The thing is not to see that as a moral, or prejudice. You have to see\n\nPage 5\n\nthat everybody has a place that way. As long as everybody is in the place that is correct for them, no hard feelings and everything will be fine."

      "heading": "Aloofness",
      "raw": "When we come to the sixth line, we come to the roof of the house, and there we have nothing but the deep desire for transition. Here it is called Aloofness. If you have a hexagram that is called Coming to Meet\nand you get to the sixth line and it is called Aloofness, you know that this whole process of looking for the ego is past. It is not about looking for the ego. It has to be there, of course, because it is part of the\nway that you get out: you get to the throat and to manifestation. The sixth line is always looking for something much grander, in that sense. Be aware of something: all sixth lines have within them a\npotential to be deeply depressed. This ability to stand on the top of the house, to be finished with the process and to be able to look out beyond and wonder what is there and long for it because it is the\nresonance to the One Night Stand: it may come or it may not. You may get that opportunity or you may not. Because of that, there is this sense of, in the aloofness, \"Nobody is really going to fulfill that for me. I\nwill not get that quality of ego that will lead far beyond all of this material plane that the personnel manager is locked into.\"\n\nPluto exalted. A perfected renewal in which the establishment of a new form inures one to the condemnation of the rejected. This is somebody who has their growing up and they end up finding\nthemselves moving, for example, towards a career where they could have this kind of work. They would never stay there. They could never live out the personnel manager as a personnel manager. There is\nalways something else that is further beyond for them. What is further beyond is the new form: something that is going to change the way that whole hierarchical structure operates.\n\nThe awareness of patterns, which ensures one's instinctive well-being. They do not need the ego on the other side. They are not lusting after it because they can be well within themselves.\n\nOn the other side: The awareness of patterns that can bolster the ego at the expense of the well-being of others. This has nothing to do with being concerned about just any other ego on the other side. It is about\nsomething else.\n\nUntil they find that 'something else', they can never commit themselves to the power that is there. Their ability is to recognize a very special quality of ego that will be, in the mystical sense, a real surrender and\nthat what gets transmitted is something totally new. All sixth lines can infuse the collective with something that they are not yet aware of. All sixth lines, because they are collective themes, can go deep\ninto the collective. This is where the collective gets constantly enriched from the individual, from the tribe, so that the collective slowly becomes this umbrella that we all can live within. A very important role\nhere in the 44th gate.\n\nPage 6"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 44 COMING TO MEET\n\nWe will shift to the possibilities and, in doing so, understand that there is an unseen process that takes place. There is a movement between potential and possibility. It uses the language of the mind to describe\nit. I call it conceptualizing. One has to divorce oneself from thinking that conceptualizing is a word that describes a mental process. Let's take the assumption that this is a word we can use to describe the\nawareness process, which requires a leap. There is a jump, like neurons firing in the brain. There is a jump that takes place between the potential and the possibility. This is a very special place. Because\nwe know that we deal with a wave environment at the emotional level and a frequency environment at the awareness level, we know that there is a movement in the frequency from the potential to the possibility.\n\nOne of the things that we will see as we go through our process with the lines is that you can almost read what takes place in between the lines. When you go for example to the 44.1, that started in the 32.1 and\nthere is a process of conceptualizing to bring the possibility of that awareness to a point of clarity. This is a very special place. One of the things to keep in mind is that when you come to doing your own line\nstudies, you will discover that, as you move through the lines, this movement becomes visible. You can see what is taking place as a conceptualizing process moving from the potential to the possibility.\n\nThe 44th hexagram and the 24th hexagram that is opposite it, the 19th and the 33rd hexagram form a cross in the zodiac. It is called the cross of The Four Ways. Coming to Meet is one of the four ways, the\nonly one that is healthy. What you have to keep in mind about the relationship between the splenic and the heart center is that this is the only place where they meet. The thymus gland sits in the 26th gate and\nour lymphatic system is rooted in the 44th gate. Out of these two is where our basic protective system is developed: the B-cells are produced in the 44th gate and the T-cells are produced in the 26th gate.\nTogether they form the healthiest channel that we have. The nice joke is that the healthiest way is the material way. This is very true because we have 10 million children born each week that are born hungry\nIt is obvious they are not healthy because they are lacking material sustenance.\n\nIn the hierarchy, we see that the 44th gate, in terms of this material movement, is the personnel manager.\nIt is the great nose. It can smell anything. That is what it is there for. The gate of alertness: Coming to\nMeet. It says here (above the lines in the original white book), the possibility is the transformation stored or not as a memory.\n\nRemember that the 32nd gate, the potential in this stream, is the potential to recognize what can be transformed, or not. Once the 32nd gate (the financial officer) says, \"I am going to spend my money on\nit,\" at that moment, the 44th gate is ready to take that and store it as a memory. It stores what that is and works with it. When it is stored as a memory in the 44th gate, then they know exactly that the 26 will be\nable to carry that out. After all, the 44 cannot do it itself. The splenic system is not a motor. It is looking for the ego and its willpower in order to fulfill whatever this transformation potential is. It is one thing for\nthe 54 to come up with the energy for the transformation. It is another thing for the 32 to say, \"All right, we will commit to it.\" It is yet another thing for the 44 to go looking for the right ego, but it still has to get\nout there and manifest in the end.\n\nThe awareness possibility is the osmotic regulator. This is cellular memory. This is the water balance.\nThis is where the cellular memory is at its deepest. This is the pure gate of instinct, which means that the first and second lines that are instinctive themes represent the deepest cellular memory that you are going\nto find in a human being. These people have a very, very rich memory system. This is a spontaneous memory. Do not forget that we are dealing with an existential center. This is not a memory that can be\ncalled up. The 26th gate is the ability to manipulate, The Taming Power of the Great. The memory in the\n44 is available instinctively in the moment, and it is there to recognize what is the right ego and what isn't\n\nPage 1\n\nto fulfill the transformation. The personnel manager always has to surrender to the financial officer's decision.\n\nIn the 32nd hexagram the heading was: The only thing that endures is change, and when you come the heading of the 44th hexagram you have: The success of any interaction is based on the absence of any\npreconditions. There are no preconditions. There is the instinctive memory of what is necessary which will simply respond in the now to the right relationship, to the right interaction in order to fulfill the\ntransformation.\n\n44.1 Conditions\n\nWhenever you are dealing with first lines, you are dealing with the keynote of introspection. We know that this is the foundation of the hexagram and this first line is a classic example of what a foundation\nreally means because it establishes the basic nature of what Coming to Meet is all about. This is one of the four ways. It is called Conditions. It says, The establishment of frameworks as the result of\ninteraction. This is what surrender is all about: it has to take place within a specific framework. Here is this transformation we want to bring about. Here is the framework of how it gets done.\n\nPluto exalted. A mastery of the collective that can establish restrictive conditions for inferior components with the ability to enforce them. Think about that. This is the foundation of this hexagram. It starts with\nthe mastery of the collective. This is very important to understand.\n\nThis is one of the four ways to our well43eing and our health, to our financial success.

All second lines are projection outwards, with the inability to be introspective. They cannot look inwards, which means that they are not looking\nfor the people. They are looking towards: Can we get to the goal? Due to that, they can often make mistakes with the people because they are more interested in the goal.\n\nWhen you look at the second line, it is called Management.

The fourth line is an externalization line and, therefore, has a single track. It is deeply fixed on one aspect. Here, this aspect is called Honesty. It says: The refusal to engage in\nhypocritical interaction. These are people whose management style is considered to be straight forward.\nThey are very direct.\n\nPluto exalted. Indifference at its most logical and cutting. The indifference is to the needs of the individual. After all, this is taking the people-manager resonance from the first line. There is this deep\nindifference to all this stuff about having to work really hard to make sure that the other is really comfortable with all this.\n\nBy the time you get to the fourth line, you know that there is something on the other side and the only way the fourth line is able to work with them is that it is very direct with them.\n\nThe Sun in detriment, that in extreme situations, in cases of self-sustainment, will expect assistance from forces it has totally rejected. Here the honesty is the genuine need. You want to do business with\nsomebody and, being a fourth line, you are very direct and say, \"Look, I am not in the ABC business, I am in the XYZ business, go away.\" Two years later, you discover that you want to get into the ABC\nbusiness and you call up the very people you rejected and you can actually say to them, \"Why don't you come over and we'll talk. Now, I am interested in the ABC business.\" This is all about being direct. This\n\nPage 4\n\ndirectness can seem obsessive because there is nothing else there. They can only be focused in that honesty, in that one transformation that they want to bring about.\n\nThe indifference possible when guided by the instinctive memory. In other words, you really know the type, so why mess around? Put it straight to them.\n\nOn the other side: The sacrifice of indifference for survival. In other words, when a change can come (this is all about transformation) then they can go back to the very thing that they rejected, being very honest\nand being seen that way.\n\n44.5 Manipulation\n\nThe fifth line is the finish of the hexagram process. Here you have the completion of what the hexagram is all about. Within the hexagram, you have the ability to universalize the process. Please understand in\nthis sense that the 44/26 represents the immune system of the tribe. It is the defense system for the tribe. It is what keeps the tribe healthy. This material reality, this fifth line, represents literally what that is all\nabout: what is going to keep the tribe immune from disease, immune from failure at the material level.\nThe 32nd gate was the fear of failure and the 44th gate is the fear of the past and they are trying to overcome those fears through having material success in the present.\n\nThe fifth line is called Manipulation. The ability to transform interaction with inferior elements into the energizing of progressive processes with the additional benefit that, in tapping the inferior elements, they\nremain weak. Think about the nature of that. That is, you cannot have everybody climb the ladder of the hierarchy. This does not work and yet, at the same time, inferior elements being part of the tribe need to\nhave their sustenance, need to be protected and need to have a sense of self-worth within the community.\n\nThe gift of this sort of manipulation is to integrate these forces into the operation and allow them to have their place by making them comfortable through the manipulating style of the personnel manager and, at\nthe same time, have them be satisfied that they will spend 55 years plugging bolds into the side of a car.\nThis is absolutely essential on this planet. Otherwise things fall apart.\n\nOn the other side of this, Mars in detriment. The tendency in this form of manipulation to become abusive and degenerate to their level. This is the dictatorial fiat. This is the need for control in the 32nd gate. Here,\nin the detriment of the fifth line of the 44, it becomes the power trip. \"I have the power and you don't.\nYou do what you are told.\" I can be very abusive.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: Where the instinctive recognitions of the patterns leads to the possible manipulation of others. Again, manipulation without any negative connotation. Without a proper\nhierarchy, there is no success. I have grown up in North America which was rooted in the idea that the traditional hierarchical caste systems could be replaced, so that they would throw away the ideas of\nmonarchy and institute republics. If you go to North America today, they simply replaced that with the monetary class system: how much money you make. The moment they meet you, they want to know how\nmuch money you make because then they can put you into a place within the hierarchy.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that, if you are working for a company and you are getting well paid relative to what you do, you don't mind that the CEO is taking home two million dollars. It astonishes me how many\nemployees find it quite normal that the boss is making this enormous fortune while they are slaving for forty-eight hours a week. However, this is natural to us. This is our way. We are animals. Animals are all\nhierarchical, no matter how sophisticated we look as a patina on the surface. Everything is about hierarchy, and it will not go away. The thing is not to see that as a moral, or prejudice. You have to see\n\nPage 5\n\nthat everybody has a place that way. As long as everybody is in the place that is correct for them, no hard feelings and everything will be fine.\n\n44.6 Aloofness\n\nWhen we come to the sixth line, we come to the roof of the house, and there we have nothing but the deep desire for transition. Here it is called Aloofness. If you have a hexagram that is called Coming to Meet\nand you get to the sixth line and it is called Aloofness, you know that this whole process of looking for the ego is past. It is not about looking for the ego. It has to be there, of course, because it is part of the\nway that you get out: you get to the throat and to manifestation. The sixth line is always looking for something much grander, in that sense. Be aware of something: all sixth lines have within them a\npotential to be deeply depressed. This ability to stand on the top of the house, to be finished with the process and to be able to look out beyond and wonder what is there and long for it because it is the\nresonance to the One Night Stand: it may come or it may not. You may get that opportunity or you may not. Because of that, there is this sense of, in the aloofness, \"Nobody is really going to fulfill that for me. I\nwill not get that quality of ego that will lead far beyond all of this material plane that the personnel manager is locked into.\"\n\nPluto exalted. A perfected renewal in which the establishment of a new form inures one to the condemnation of the rejected. This is somebody who has their growing up and they end up finding\nthemselves moving, for example, towards a career where they could have this kind of work. They would never stay there. They could never live out the personnel manager as a personnel manager. There is\nalways something else that is further beyond for them. What is further beyond is the new form: something that is going to change the way that whole hierarchical structure operates.\n\nThe awareness of patterns, which ensures one's instinctive well-being. They do not need the ego on the other side. They are not lusting after it because they can be well within themselves.\n\nOn the other side: The awareness of patterns that can bolster the ego at the expense of the well-being of others. This has nothing to do with being concerned about just any other ego on the other side. It is about\nsomething else.\n\nUntil they find that 'something else', they can never commit themselves to the power that is there. Their ability is to recognize a very special quality of ego that will be, in the mystical sense, a real surrender and\nthat what gets transmitted is something totally new. All sixth lines can infuse the collective with something that they are not yet aware of. All sixth lines, because they are collective themes, can go deep\ninto the collective. This is where the collective gets constantly enriched from the individual, from the tribe, so that the collective slowly becomes this umbrella that we all can live within. A very important role\nhere in the 44th gate.\n\nPage 6",

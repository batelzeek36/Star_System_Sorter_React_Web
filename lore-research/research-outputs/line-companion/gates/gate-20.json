If you own a cat, it is easy to understand. The cat is sitting there in\nthe now and is really lbakimg disinterested in everything.. It seems to be totally disinterested but it is not.\nIt is being very superficial on the surface. It looks very shallow at what it is; doing but all of its antennae are ready and alert- for anything,, at any moment. This is not about being in the now and walking around,\ntrying to swallow everything. This is the recognition that you are always in the now and you can go, about the business of your life because there is this force inside of you that will make contact with the\nperiphery.\n\nVenus exalted. The raising of superficiality to an art form. The sloganeer. In terms of the white, book:\nSuperficial expression as an art form. These people are very aware of what is happening one the.\nmundane plane! around them. That is their superficiality. They are very dear about what is going on in the world around them because the primary nature of this is to keep them alive. So they are aware of what is\ngoing on around them but if you have a conversation with them,, iit will be very superficial.. It is like \"Do you notice the change in the!weather$'iust a little while ago, there was ai change in the pressure.\" They\ntalk about the kinds of things that they are! aware of in the present, and they-will seem very superficial.\nThey are not. Don't confuse the way in which these peoplb project out their \" 1 know\" as. of they are really only on the surface. They are not.. There is; a great deal going on underneath.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. The superficial expression of the personality. In the white book: The expression of the superficial personality. These people look like only beings on the surface and anybody who knows\nthese people all say the same thing: \"They are very superficial.\" I want to tell you something. You put these people in a situation of life and death and they are anything but superficial. They are aware in the\nnow. They have this mechanical capacity in the now to respond to what is there in the now. But on the surface, they are on the surface almost all of the time other than in those moments of threat. That is the\nnature of being in the now. There is nothing to do except in the moment of threat. To respond and to be able to protect yourself in order to survive is the capacity in this gate."

      "raw": "Page 1 C\n\nWe get to the line of projection. These people are projecting out their existential potential. They are projecting out that they know who they are. \"I know I am,\" or \"I know I am now,\" is the voice. This line\nis called The Dogmatist. Restrictive and intentionally limited understanding. These are people in the now but what they are projecting out in the now is a narrow field. They see certain things in the now but they\ndo not see everything in the now because they do not have this entire periphery. Due to that, they can be very dogmatic about that now and that view that they have. 'Restrictive and intentionally limited\nunderstanding' is limited perspective in that sense.\n\nVenus exalted. The limitation, if personal and exclusive, is less negative through ascetic withdrawal. In the white book: A restrictive awareness in the now. What happens to these people is that they are going to\nbang into a lot of difficulty because they are individual, after all. Individuals always attract attention and individuals have to explain themselves. They have this narrow view. What happens to them is that other\npeople try to bring them out into the periphery and they are very uncomfortable and back away. They back away because they are only interested in those people that are interested in their dogmatic view\nbecause that is what they need. They need people who pay attention to that.\n\nMoon in detriment. The power to lead others down a narrow path. Everybody that carries the 20 carries with them the possibility to lead people in their survival process. These are people that can guide you\ndown a path but it is a very specific path. It is very narrow. By the way, narrow is not a pejorative.\nNarrow is not a bad word. To be led down a narrow path: if you have somebody who is teaching you how to be a neurophysiologist, you don't want somebody who teaches you Jimi Hendrix every half hour. You\nwant this narrow path so that you can go down that road and learn from that.\n\nThe gift through expression of leading others down a narrow path. \"I know right now what is good for you. \" Again, they may or may not. They may really know what is going on in the now or not because they\ncan be a paper tiger. It is all a projection going out. Their favorite expression is, \"My way or the highway\"."

      "raw": "We are dealing with an individual process here, so we are not dealing with the collective process. We are not dealing with anything other than this deep empowerment to be individual. In the 12.3, there was this\npotential for exaggerated self-hatred due to the trial and error process. Here we have Self-awareness.\nThese are people who are only conscious of themselves in the now. They are always seeing their own process going on, so they are very self conscious. They are really there, existentially watching their\nmovie. Out of that can come great wisdom. If you really watch yourself, you see what happens to you, and what happens to you is your life. It is something very valuable.\n\nUnderstanding derived horn analysis of personal actions and effects. The proper attunement and development of the personality through self -consciousness. On the other side, we have: Self-\nconsciousness in the extreme that hampers development. People are so concerned with what they are doing in the now that they don't function properly anymore. This is the other side. They are so concerned\nabout what is going on around them in the now that they literally don't have the ability to maintain their individuality or individual integrity in those situations.\n\nThe expression of self-conscious awareness in the now; or The expression of self-consciousness in the extreme. These people are very uncomfortable. You don't see yourself. After all, the individual is\nprojecting out from inside of them, just like everybody else. What they are watching is the wave effect between themselves and the world. In doing so, individuals discover that most of the world does not want\nto have anything to do with them because they are strangers by their very nature.\n\nPage 2C\n\nSo there is this inherent self -consciousness in all individuals. All individuality carries within it this self- consciousness, this concern that the world does not pay any attention, or the world will not notice you, or\nyou are not able to give an explanation. These people can carry this to the extreme, constantly watching, constantly being on the alert in the now. I had one person with the 20.3 who told me, \"I don't like what I\nsee\". There is nothing to do because this is a mechanic. I told him, \"If you don't see what you like, also see there is nothing you can do about that. Anybody that is here in the now gets to see everything. \" It is\nnot that this makes life horrible.\n\nThe trial and error in this process is that, while you are watching your own movie, you learn so many things because it does not always work. Every time you are trying to watch yourself, your whole self-\nanalysis is going to come out of interaction with others.\n\nWe are talking about the 20th gate alone. We are not talking about it being connected. It is always looking to the other side, yet it does not know that it is there, so it will always bump into it. When they meet\nsomebody who rejects them because they are individual, they watch that in the movie. They take all that on themselves. They become uncomfortable. \"Why didn't that work? Why was I made so\nuncomfortable?\" and that restricts them the next time, or it adds to their experience and they learn to recognize who they can be \"I am in the now\" with. That is part of their learning process. It is a feedback\nprocess and you don't know it because you are not always connected to the rest of it."

      "raw": "Here in the upper trigram, we are dealing with externalization. We are dealing with this one-track- process. We are also dealing with the nature of opportunity and this gate is going to meet the 10.4, the\npotential for awakening. That potential lies in recognizing the right opportunity.\n\nThis line is called Application. Recognition and awareness that can only be transformed into action in cooperation with those who have the ability to act upon understanding. This is one of the keys to pure\nindividuality. The pure individual says, \"I know I can integrate with you only if you can follow my knowing. If you cannot understand my explanation, this is not going to work.\" This is the whole thing\nabout the knower. The knower can have a wonderful relationship with those that can grasp the explanation of the knowing. This is the nature of what application is about.\n\nAgain, here we have a gate in the throat that is open to all kinds of things and, in and of itself, it is still limited. The fourth line knows that there is a 57th gate that has the awareness, so it can say, \"I know I am\nnow\". It knows that the 34th gate is there with its energy so it says, \"I know I am doing now.\" When the\n10th gate is there, it can say, \"I know what I am doing for myself now.\" Built into that mechanic is the recognition that all of those forces are there in various combinations, waiting.\n\nThis application has two sides. The Jupiter side: The teacher whose students transcend him/her, and the\nMercury side: The tendency to prefer theory to application. They are not very different because this is the knower that says, \"I know but I need you to recognize that knowing and if you do so, it is a value for you.\nI may even give you enough value as a base so that you can transcend me, or that person, as a teacher.\"\n\nIn the white book: Where the expression of awareness can only be turned into action through others. The teacher; or The expression of awareness as theory with little interest in its application. Well, it is not\nimportant for that knower who does not have his own energy. I know many people with the fourth line detriment; they are people who know things in the now and have all kinds of theories that have come out\nof that recognition in the now. But they don't care what anybody does with it. The exalted has the same experience, experiencing things in the now, knowing something about that and immediately wanting to be\nable to empower others with that knowledge. Both of these sides of the line are teachers. The exalted\n\nPage 3C\n\nteacher always gets exactly the right students, and the detriment teacher gets the students that they know can't really grasp it and who will never be able to transcend them. So, they are just happy enough to offer\nthe theory."

      "heading": "Realism",
      "raw": "The fifth line is called Realism. This is a line of universalization. It is a line that gets projected on, and it is a very difficult line. Everybody is projecting on this line that these people know. Everybody is\nprojecting on them that they are the ones that know what is really going on in the now. They may or may not.\n\nThe first thing that the fifth line of the 20 knows is that Contemplation, in and of itself, is no guarantee of success. It is not enough to be existential. If you don't have any power, what will you do with what you\nrecognize in the now? If you don't have any awareness, what can you make of it? And if you don't have any identity, who are you in the now? These are three other gates that the 20 points towards. The fifth line\nrecognizes, because it is deeply aware, that there is the other side. They know that all three of those gates are out there and know that being in the now is not enough. You can be in the now. You can stand there\nand say, \"Oh, there is a car coming towards me,\" but if you don't have a motor, you will die. It is not going to help you to be conscious of that in the now. It does not help you to be existential if you can't get\nout of the way.\n\nThe fifth line understands the cold, hard reality of what life is and there is nobody else in this life that you are going to meet that will point to life and show you all of its beauty and all of its ugliness. That is what\nthey see. They see the reality of what things are. This is not necessarily pleasing.\n\nSaturn exalted. Where concentration on details results in a perfected form. Perfected form is part of the whole Integration process. These people recognize after a while that it is not enough to be existential. \"I\nhave to find out where all these other sources of energy and power and awareness are so that I can access them in order to get to the perfected form of survival. \"\n\nUranus in detriment. Where reality creates dissatisfaction and adds to instability. Uranus stands for suddenness and unexpectedness. These are people that walk out of their house in the morning and they\nsee everything that is ugly. They see the garbage that was not put in the garbage can. They see the drunk that is sitting in the doorway. They see the rust eating away at the bottom of a car. They see what needs to\nbe repaired. They see the grayness in people's faces, the coldness in their eyes. They get the whole movie with one breath. It is a real gift that these people have. But, unless they are connected to awareness, unless\nthey are connected to the motor, unless they are connected to the identity, they are deeply uncomfortable with this capacity to see the world as it is. They are not believers. These are not abstract people. They\ndon't have any faith. They are not logical people trying to find a pattern and project into the future. They just look around and see what they see.\n\nThe success of expressing awareness through detail; or The expression of awareness in the now through dissatisfaction with the reality one sees. These people sound like whiners but they are not. They really do\nsee what is ugly. For them, that is quite a burden in their life because it is very hard for them unless they are integrated to the rest of this Integration system. It is hard for them to see why life is worth surviving."

      "heading": "Wisdom",
      "raw": "Like all sixth lines, there is something else that is at work here. This line is called Wisdom.\nContemplation which results in the ability to apply understanding. That may or may not be the case.\n\nPage 4 □\n\nThis is a deeply individual line. Any individual line says, \"I am now.\" I have this line and I have the\nVenus exalted, so I am very fortunate in that. This line does not care about the world and this line can be misread that way. I certainly never cared about the world, nor did I ever have the idea for even a fraction\nof a moment that what I was going through in the now could be of value to anybody. This is typical of the sixth line. What is there for me to say to the collective if I don't know anything myself? And all knowers\nare like that. They know things and they don't know things and they go through their life.\n\nThis line is about the individual staying with their individual process. There is within it The ability to transform individual awareness for general application and understanding. Don't stand in line and wait for\nthat. The fact that there is the ability does not mean, like all sixth lines, that that is going to come out, and very often that wisdom looks very dumb.\n\nThis is one of the jokes about all of these things because these people are not necessarily going to put that energy out on you and take their individual experience and try to turn that into a direction for you. It is\nvery difficult for the individual to do that. They have to know; they have to be able to explain it. They have to have those that are willing to listen and, ultimately, those that can actualize it before there is any\ncertainty in any of that. Venus exalted. The establishment for the benefit of society, values, ideals and their patterns, and how they can be understood and applied.\n\nThe Mercury in detriment is not any different. It is the theoretical. The same as above, but motivated by the self satisfying mental challenge rather than altruism. These are very individual people living out a\nvery individual process. Because there is no such thing as personal karma, these people can be pulled into the needs of others and, if they live long enough and their existential process has been broad enough, they\nmay be able to make a contribution to the totality. But all sixth lines wait for some kind of force that projects that on them. I got that in a very clear way in my confrontation with the Voice. I had to deal with\nsomething that imposed upon me something that was not there naturally. The mutation was brought to me. Otherwise, none of that stuff would have had any value. It is true for all sixth lines.\n\nI am not saying that you can't experience a sixth line unless you have some kind of science fiction event.\nThat is not true. What I'm saying is that there are only very special circumstances in your life that are going to bring out the potential of any sixth line. When you have children (that is my concern) that have a\nlot of sixth lines, or they have a Sun/Earth configuration that is in the sixth line, you have to recognize that you may never see their potential. You can never allow these children to feel uncomfortable because\nof that. The reality is that they are gifted, but it is up to life whether or not that gift has any real value.\n\nWye all have special attributes, but it is a question of what life demands and not what we have. So many people are deeply frustrated because what they have they want to push out into the world, but if the world\nis not ready for it and the world doesn't want it, the world will not take it. This is just the way things work. All sixth lines, in that sense, are waiting for a sign from the gods, whatever that sign happens to be.\nIt does not have to be spiritual or mystical. It can be a car accident. It can be all kinds of things that trigger the potential that lies inside all of these sixth lines.\n\nPage 5C"

This is awareness in the now, so there is a great deal of confusion about this statement,\n'recognition and awareness'. This is not an awareness gate, so do not get carried away by that. This is a mechanical gate that brings you into the now. It is a mechanical gate that has direct access to awareness,\nto the 57th gate in the splenic system and the potential for awareness, in that sense.

It is a line that gets projected on, and it is a very difficult line. Everybody is projecting on this line that these people know. Everybody is\nprojecting on them that they are the ones that know what is really going on in the now. They may or may not.\n\nThe first thing that the fifth line of the 20 knows is that Contemplation, in and of itself, is no guarantee of success. It is not enough to be existential. If you don't have any power, what will you do with what you\nrecognize in the now? If you don't have any awareness, what can you make of it? And if you don't have any identity, who are you in the now? These are three other gates that the 20 points towards. The fifth line\nrecognizes, because it is deeply aware, that there is the other side. They know that all three of those gates are out there and know that being in the now is not enough. You can be in the now. You can stand there\nand say, \"Oh, there is a car coming towards me,\" but if you don't have a motor, you will die. It is not going to help you to be conscious of that in the now. It does not help you to be existential if you can't get\nout of the way.\n\nThe fifth line understands the cold, hard reality of what life is and there is nobody else in this life that you are going to meet that will point to life and show you all of its beauty and all of its ugliness. That is what\nthey see. They see the reality of what things are. This is not necessarily pleasing.\n\nSaturn exalted. Where concentration on details results in a perfected form. Perfected form is part of the whole Integration process. These people recognize after a while that it is not enough to be existential. \"I\nhave to find out where all these other sources of energy and power and awareness are so that I can access them in order to get to the perfected form of survival. \"\n\nUranus in detriment. Where reality creates dissatisfaction and adds to instability. Uranus stands for suddenness and unexpectedness. These are people that walk out of their house in the morning and they\nsee everything that is ugly. They see the garbage that was not put in the garbage can. They see the drunk that is sitting in the doorway. They see the rust eating away at the bottom of a car. They see what needs to\nbe repaired. They see the grayness in people's faces, the coldness in their eyes. They get the whole movie with one breath. It is a real gift that these people have. But, unless they are connected to awareness, unless\nthey are connected to the motor, unless they are connected to the identity, they are deeply uncomfortable with this capacity to see the world as it is. They are not believers. These are not abstract people. They\ndon't have any faith. They are not logical people trying to find a pattern and project into the future. They just look around and see what they see.\n\nThe success of expressing awareness through detail; or The expression of awareness in the now through dissatisfaction with the reality one sees. These people sound like whiners but they are not. They really do\nsee what is ugly. For them, that is quite a burden in their life because it is very hard for them unless they are integrated to the rest of this Integration system. It is hard for them to see why life is worth surviving.\n\n20.6 Wisdom\n\nLike all sixth lines, there is something else that is at work here. This line is called Wisdom.\nContemplation which results in the ability to apply understanding. That may or may not be the case.\n\nPage 4 □\n\nThis is a deeply individual line. Any individual line says, \"I am now.\" I have this line and I have the\nVenus exalted, so I am very fortunate in that. This line does not care about the world and this line can be misread that way. I certainly never cared about the world, nor did I ever have the idea for even a fraction\nof a moment that what I was going through in the now could be of value to anybody. This is typical of the sixth line. What is there for me to say to the collective if I don't know anything myself? And all knowers\nare like that. They know things and they don't know things and they go through their life.\n\nThis line is about the individual staying with their individual process. There is within it The ability to transform individual awareness for general application and understanding. Don't stand in line and wait for\nthat. The fact that there is the ability does not mean, like all sixth lines, that that is going to come out, and very often that wisdom looks very dumb.\n\nThis is one of the jokes about all of these things because these people are not necessarily going to put that energy out on you and take their individual experience and try to turn that into a direction for you. It is\nvery difficult for the individual to do that. They have to know; they have to be able to explain it. They have to have those that are willing to listen and, ultimately, those that can actualize it before there is any\ncertainty in any of that. Venus exalted. The establishment for the benefit of society, values, ideals and their patterns, and how they can be understood and applied.\n\nThe Mercury in detriment is not any different. It is the theoretical. The same as above, but motivated by the self satisfying mental challenge rather than altruism. These are very individual people living out a\nvery individual process. Because there is no such thing as personal karma, these people can be pulled into the needs of others and, if they live long enough and their existential process has been broad enough, they\nmay be able to make a contribution to the totality. But all sixth lines wait for some kind of force that projects that on them. I got that in a very clear way in my confrontation with the Voice. I had to deal with\nsomething that imposed upon me something that was not there naturally. The mutation was brought to me. Otherwise, none of that stuff would have had any value. It is true for all sixth lines.\n\nI am not saying that you can't experience a sixth line unless you have some kind of science fiction event.\nThat is not true. What I'm saying is that there are only very special circumstances in your life that are going to bring out the potential of any sixth line. When you have children (that is my concern) that have a\nlot of sixth lines, or they have a Sun/Earth configuration that is in the sixth line, you have to recognize that you may never see their potential. You can never allow these children to feel uncomfortable because\nof that. The reality is that they are gifted, but it is up to life whether or not that gift has any real value.\n\nWye all have special attributes, but it is a question of what life demands and not what we have. So many people are deeply frustrated because what they have they want to push out into the world, but if the world\nis not ready for it and the world doesn't want it, the world will not take it. This is just the way things work. All sixth lines, in that sense, are waiting for a sign from the gods, whatever that sign happens to be.\nIt does not have to be spiritual or mystical. It can be a car accident. It can be all kinds of things that trigger the potential that lies inside all of these sixth lines.\n\nPage 5C",

      "heading": "Money isn't everything",
      "raw": "First lines always describe the nature of a hexagram. It says Money isn't everything. It is very important to understand the nature of this gate. This is an individual power source that is focused on bringing about\norder through empowering the right direction.\n\nThe recognition that wealth has its own problems. Jupiter exalted. The lust for lucre tempered by higher principals. Mercury in detriment. The delusion that you can throw money at problems. The basis of this\nhexagram on the exalted side is the desperation to turn the energy into currency. You want that energy to be converted into a successful direction. After all, it is a main tantric channel. In the detriment, there is\nthis sense that you give your energy to others so that they will get you to the right direction. I know so many 14's who look at my 2 and say, \"I have the key and you'll be the driver.\"\n\nIn the white book: The key to manifesting power is higher principles. The higher principle is, \"I am not wasting my energy. I use my energy for the correct direction in my process in order to bring about order.\"\n\nThe other side of this is: Energy alone can never be the key. You can't just pay someone to take you to the right direction. It does not work. You can't just throw your energy at them. Think about the dilemma of\nthe third gate, which is the inherent confusion in the life process. That confusion has not disappeared by the time you get to the 14th gate.\n\nWe are still talking about an unaware center. The 14th gate has all the power within it to drive, but it does not know where to drive. On its own, it can't know where to drive, so there is always a tendency in people\nwith the 14th gate to make attempts at doing things that are not for them, or they will ask other people to take them into that direction.\n\nThere is a helplessness in this Possession in Great Measure. It is important to understand that it is an enormously powerful gate but it is truly vulnerable to being misguided. Remember that the first line is\nthere to understand the nature of the hexagram: it does have this power for direction, but that does not mean that it knows what to do with it. It does not know where it is going in its process."

      "heading": "Management",
      "raw": "When you get to the second line, you get to projection. Instead of being involved in recognizing the nature of one's own power to empower, here is someone who is projecting out that they have that power.\n\nThis line is called Management. It is a joke. The wisdom that investing in expertise brings rewards. First of all, wisdom is something that you do not get right away in life. You may never get it at all. This is an\nadvice to the second line. It says expertise would really help you to find the right direction. When you are\n\nPage 1\n\ndealing with the first three lines, the lower trigram, there is no capacity to understand the nature of the other side. The 14.1, 2 and 3 know at some level that there is this power within them, but they do not\nknow the driver. They always have to meet the driver. They just project out this energy.\n\nJupiter exalted. Expansion. The ability to delegate responsibility. Mars in detriment. The vanity to be one's own best expert. This is individual. Built into their genetic individual material (that means every\nsingle genetic gate) is a selfpreservation phenomenon that says, \"Don't interfere with me. Don't take me away from my trip. Don't try to control me. Don't try to condition me.\" All individuality is that way.\n\nWhen you get to the second line, the exalted says: The key to power lies in not trying to be and do everything alone. Remember, that they are projecting out that they have this power. So that is what they\nassume they can do. \"I have the power and I can get my own direction. Nobody needs to help me.\"\n\nOn the other side: The key to power is doing everything individually. It is Mars. You know, I try very hard to get you to let go of your moralistic judgments about this and that. Mars, in its immaturity, gets a\nvery bad reputation. In this particular line, that immaturity is actually of value because the immaturity says, \"I do not need anybody else. I do have the power. I can do it myself. I know where I will go.\" It\ndoes not mean that they do. It still means that they will run into all the problems that second lines run into, which is being found out: big talk about your direction but you do not get there.\n\nBy the way, if someone comes to me for a reading and they have the detriment in that line, I tell them, \"Be your own expert, no matter what happens.\" That is their nature. None of this is about seeing any of\nthose aspects as being less, or missing, or wrong. It is exactly what the genetic information within them demands, in that sense."

      "heading": "Service",
      "raw": "When you get to the third line, you get to Service. By the way, people who have the 14th gate always have a great deal of power within them and they are often very successful materially in their process\nbecause that power does convert. When they find the right direction they can always turn that energy into currency. They can always turn that energy into what looks after them.\n\nWhen you come to the third line, you come to the process of trial and error in life. The whole thing for the\n14 is to recognize that the only way for them to get through the whole process, ultimately, is to find some way to externalize that energy as service.\n\nThe utilization of talent and wealth for the highest good. This channel leads to the 8/1 which is the\nCreative Role Model. Individuality is never about being best. It is about being different. The wealth and talent of any individual lies in the glorification of their own individuality and their identification with\ntheir individuality, so that they can be different.\n\nEarth exalted. Selfless contribution to society. That sounds very nice. It does not mean that it is going to work. It does not mean that they will be rewarded, because they will make mistakes. \"I will give my\nenergy to the anarchist movement.\" That service to any kind of higher principle (by the way, those are relative terms) is going to be filled with trial and error and these people will offer their energy to different\ndrivers until they have the experience to recognize which driver can really be good for them.\n\nNeptune in detriment. Greed and the self-destruction of moral fiber. This line is deeply misunderstood.\nThe greed of this line is what you see at the very top, 'The accumulation and retention of power'. If you are holding all this power inside of you and you do not find a way to release it, it will make you ill. It is\nthe greed of saying, \"I am not going to provide you with that energy.\" It is like driving up to a gas station\n\nPage 2\n\nwith your car and the car is empty. You push it in and the gas station attendant looks at you and says, \"No. I want to keep this gasoline because my car can run out of gasoline. You'd better push your car some\nplace else.\"\n\nThe 'moral fiber' is in the sense of how society will react to that kind of holding back of all of that energy:\nby condemning it. If somebody has this line, it does not mean that it is a negative. It means that is the way in which they are going to come to grips with this process of trial and error.\n\nRemember, everything about the 14th hexagram is dependent on wisdom, which comes later. So, what these people end up being very good at, late in life, is being the ones who know that there will always be\nthe possibility for a perfect place to put their energy. It is deep inside. It does not get to manifest until the resonance in the sixth line. In reality, there is this touch of it underneath where they say, \"Aha, I am\nactually holding on to all of this money so that I can give it away to a really good cause, but I have not found the cause yet. If I do find it, I will give it all away.\" Bill Gates said: \"I am too young to give away\nmy money, and I do not know what to give it to. \" Holding on with the potential that it can be of service."

      "raw": "The 14th gate may not be aware. The nature of the fuel conditions the direction. Think about it as the difference between a vegetarian and a carnivore. A vegetarian 14 or a carnivore 14 will push you in\ndifferent directions because you have to shop in different places to fulfill that energy. It may not be aware, but it will change the direction just out of the very nature of the energy. When you come to the fourth\nline, you come to the first possibility to be able to go across the channel to recognize that one has to deal with the other side: that there is a driver.\n\nThe first thing that this is all about is the skill of being able to fix your power and show it on the outside.\nThe fourth line is always about being one-directional, being focused, being fixed. It is taking an aspect out of the foundation of its nature and it is fixing it. The concentration on establishing a strong foundation.\n\nMoon exalted. Protection from assault. These are people that project out their power in a very fixed way.\nIt is very difficult to take these people away from that. This is their thing.\n\nMars in detriment. Overconfidence in meeting the challenge of competition that may threaten the very basis of security.\n\nThey are so fixed in their power, one way. For example, somebody that always wants to hit you in the face, if you know that they are fixed that way, you can kick them between the legs. They are not ready for\nthat. They can have a lot of power focused in one direction but they can be enormously weak all over the place. It is very important to understand that about the limitation of Security.\n\nThe key to power lies in developing skills to ensure a strong foundation. The skills lie in the focusing of that energy. These people need to have a very fixed direction in life. It is very important for them to see\nthat their energy is being put in one thing and it is moving along and they move through that path, and then they can develop the skill for using that energy.\n\nOn the other side: Without the proper skills, the inability to guarantee security. If one does not really know how to deal with that energy, if they cannot find a way of fixing that energy, they can be easily\nmanipulated by other people. Their energy gets easily pulled away. Remember that the fourth line is the beginning of this transpersonal process. Because of that, it runs into difficulties due to its fixedness. It still\ndoes not have the capacity to be embraced by the other side. That comes with the fifth line. When I do a\n\nPage 3\n\nreading for somebody who has this line, I always tell them the same thing, \"Get a job that you really love, and do it and fix your energy on it. \""

If you want all my power, you are seducing me, so you'd better take me to the right place.\"\nWhen you get to the sixth line, all that stuff is over. Here, you have the humility that recognizes very clearly that it has power. Right after that it says, \"So what?\" The fulfillment of that power can never be\nthat person's own.\n\nRemember the nature of the knowing circuit. In order for it to be fulfilled, it is not possible for one human being to carry within them that activation. It is not possible. Our knowing process and our awareness\nprocesses are deeply connected to our interrelationship with each other.\n\nThe recognition takes two sides: the spiritual side is, \"It is in the hands of the gods. It is god's will. This energy was given to me.\" The other side literally is the same. It is just stripped of its mystical, faith\n\nPage 4\n\noriented aspect. It is just the same: \"I am lucky.\" It is the existential good luck of being in the right place at the right time.\n\nHumility. Wealth and power at its most exalted. Sun exalted.

The\nEarth represents the existentialist recognition that material success was unavoidable... (You could not avoid being given this power.

It does not mean that they will find a driver. Think about the 59.6, the One Night\nStand. The 14.6 is saying, \"Yes, I will accept a driver but it better be a very special one because I just do not want to go around the block. I want to see the whole thing. I will accept you as a driver if, in the end, I\ncan be clear about what it is that I know through my connection to you.\"\n\nAfter all, this is all about knowing. Be clear about sixth lines. This sixth line has enormous power in it, but they rarely commit their energy to anything. It is not just about going across the channel and finding\nthe driver. It is about where the driver will take them. It is not about having the opportunity to fill the car up with fuel and drive off because the driver can turn the key and move along the road. It is: \"Where are\nwe going on this road?\"\n\nWhere every individual goes is silence. This is path of all individuality: to the silence of coming to the point where what is knowable is known. The 14.6 wants to know that the direction it takes through that\nrelationship goes where it needs to go, in order for it to know its own nature and the value of its movement through space. But all sixth lines stand back and say, \"Yes, but I'll wait. This is God's will.\"\nThis is the existential reality. This is not about being selective. This is not about looking for drivers. This is about it happening and the good fortune that one can see in that, finally, there is this possibility.\n\nPage 5"

  "raw_text": "Gate 14 is Possession in Great Measure. It does not give away its power. One of the themes that underlie this hexagram in the traditional ['Ching is this concept of wealth and the loading up of the wagon. Our\nmost common word for energy is money.\n\nThe power that is inherent here in the 14th gate is not about money in the sense of hard currency. It is about power as currency. Whenever people have defined motors and they are dependent on other people\nto get that energy out, I always tell them, \"You wouldn't walk through the street with a basket full of money and let everybody grab in there and pull out the money.\" That energy itself is a force to bring\nabout the right direction.\n\n14.1 Money isn't everything\n\nFirst lines always describe the nature of a hexagram.

When I do a\n\nPage 3\n\nreading for somebody who has this line, I always tell them the same thing, \"Get a job that you really love, and do it and fix your energy on it. \"\n\n14.5 Arrogance\n\nThe first line is about the nature of the hexagram and the fifth line is how the world wants it to be. The fifth line is in resonance to the second line. We saw that the second line projects out that power but it does\nnot necessarily have it. By the way, the 2.2 on the other side, in the detriment, can be genius as madness.\nThe inability to recognize one's own nature projecting outwards can lead to very bizarre and dangerous paths.\n\nIn the fifth line you come to a field that is being projected upon. That is why the line is called Arrogance.\nThe ever present risk inherent in positions of power. It does not mean that you are in a position of power.\nIt means that everybody assumes that you are in a position of power. When you meet a 14.5, you assume that they are powerful. This is how you project onto their energy. They may or may not be powerful.\n\nSun exalted. Innate dignity. The only protection for an individual who is projected upon as being powerful is that they'd better mind their p's and q's, or other people will gang up on them and check out\nthat power to find out how long it takes to nail them to the cross.\n\nVenus in detriment. A dissatisfaction with the gifts of others that creates feelings of superiority. You get projected on that you have the power to provide the energy for direction, but people will provide the link.\nThis is a transpersonal process, the 14 with the 2, and the 2 becomes the driver. The 14 is sitting there saying. \"I am giving this one all this fuel and this is where they take me? I don't think that they are good\ndrivers. I don't think they know where they are going.\" Out of that comes the sense of, \"They are not very important. They are not very good at what they are doing. They are limited in their capacity.\" This is the\nother side. The fifth is always being projected on. The world sees power as arrogance.\n\n14.6 Humility\n\nWhen you get to the sixth line you get to the end of a process, so you go beyond the nature of the hexagram itself. We saw that, whenever we were looking at the sixth line of any gate, it is pointed\ntowards the first line of the next gate, which is the 34.1, in this case. They are deeply related to each other.\nThere is such a mystery in following the movement of the wheel to understand what is really going on inside of us. The 34 is about keeping us alive.\n\nHere, in the sixth line, you have Humility. That is where you go from the projection of Arrogance. The\n14.5 that is clear about the nature of its energy and that has a lousy driver, has every right in the world to think that this driver doesn't know where they are going. That is not arrogance. That is the 14.5 refusing\nto be the victim of the 3.5, the theme of which was Victimization. The 14.5 says, \"I am not going to be your victim. If you want all my power, you are seducing me, so you'd better take me to the right place.\"\nWhen you get to the sixth line, all that stuff is over. Here, you have the humility that recognizes very clearly that it has power. Right after that it says, \"So what?\" The fulfillment of that power can never be\nthat person's own.\n\nRemember the nature of the knowing circuit. In order for it to be fulfilled, it is not possible for one human being to carry within them that activation. It is not possible. Our knowing process and our awareness\nprocesses are deeply connected to our interrelationship with each other.\n\nThe recognition takes two sides: the spiritual side is, \"It is in the hands of the gods. It is god's will. This energy was given to me.\" The other side literally is the same. It is just stripped of its mystical, faith\n\nPage 4\n\noriented aspect. It is just the same: \"I am lucky.\" It is the existential good luck of being in the right place at the right time.\n\nHumility. Wealth and power at its most exalted. Sun exalted. The enlightened recognition that material success is God's will. Earth in detriment. All manifestations of this position are essentially positive. The\nEarth represents the existentialist recognition that material success was unavoidable... (You could not avoid being given this power. You got it with birth.) ...and the humility engendered by such serendipity.\n\nJust because they recognize that they have been given all that power, there is nothing that says that they will do anything with it. It does not mean that they will find a driver. Think about the 59.6, the One Night\nStand. The 14.6 is saying, \"Yes, I will accept a driver but it better be a very special one because I just do not want to go around the block. I want to see the whole thing. I will accept you as a driver if, in the end, I\ncan be clear about what it is that I know through my connection to you.\"\n\nAfter all, this is all about knowing. Be clear about sixth lines. This sixth line has enormous power in it, but they rarely commit their energy to anything. It is not just about going across the channel and finding\nthe driver. It is about where the driver will take them. It is not about having the opportunity to fill the car up with fuel and drive off because the driver can turn the key and move along the road.

The 14.6 wants to know that the direction it takes through that\nrelationship goes where it needs to go, in order for it to know its own nature and the value of its movement through space.

This is about it happening and the good fortune that one can see in that, finally, there is this possibility.\n\nPage 5",

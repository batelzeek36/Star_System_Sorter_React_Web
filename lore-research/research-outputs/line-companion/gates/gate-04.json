  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 4: YOUTHFUL FOLLY\n\nWe come to the logical collective. The experience of the abstract side is always going from the present to the past, and the experience of the individual process is the dealing with the present.\nWhen we come to the logic process, there is the need to project into the future. Everything about the logic process is about finding a way in which we can be secure in the nature of the\ndirection that we take in our lives so that humanity can be preserved.\n\nThe 4 th hexagram is the need to be able to provide a solution that can be experimented with, to guarantee the perfection of the human process. Logic is universal in all life forms and so the\nlogical mind is of enormous value to humanity It is the only part of the mind that directly asks questions and gives answers. The 4 th hexagram is called Youthful Folly. The question is\ncoming from the 63, the gate of doubt, and what we have here is the channel of Logic, a design of mental ease mixed with doubt.\n\nThe 4 th gate is the gate of formulization and the potential is the awareness to judge what is suspicious in the pattern or not. It is concentration on the pattern to come up with the answer.\nThe question is: \"Is it suspicious, or not?\" The answer is about answering the question about the pattern. Everything about the logical process is about patterns. The doubt is always initiated by\na pattern. The answer always has to do with whether that pattern is worthy of doubt.\n\nRemember the nature of the 18 th gate in the correction process. The 4 th gate, like the 18 th gate, has a gift. The 1 8 th gate has the ability to be able to recognize at any given moment what needs\nto be corrected. The 4 th gate has the gift of always being able to come up with an answer. Both of those are risky things because what can be corrected at any given moment and an answer\nthat can be provided at any given moment is not necessarily the truth, nor is it necessarily something that will prove to be of value to humanity once it has been tested and experimented\nwith. One always has to be deeply suspicious of logical answers. Answers are the beginning of a process. They are the generation of a formula. The 4th gate is the gate of formulization. An\nanswer is a formula. The formula is: it is suspicious, or not.\n\nIt says above the lines: The energy to beguile and succeed despite ignorance. Freedom\n\nfrom retribution. I am reminded of Groucho Marx, whom I love very much. A waiter came up to him and asked him, \"How did you find your steak?\" \"Beside the tomatoes and underneath the\nlettuce.\" The capacity to come up with an answer has nothing to do with the truth. It is a gift to answer. I know; I have the fourth gate. It does not mean that it is the truth, and this is so\nimportant to understand. It can only be the truth after it has been tested and experimented with.\nIt does not matter how clever the answer is. The fact of the matter is that, for the benefit of humanity, everything that is logical has to be tested and experimented with. The answer is only\nthe beginning of a process.\n\n4.1 Pleasure\n\nThe first line is always the foundation and it is introspection.

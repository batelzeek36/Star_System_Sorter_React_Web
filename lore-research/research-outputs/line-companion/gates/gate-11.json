      "heading": "Attunement",
      "raw": "This line is the foundation. It is the line of introspection and it is called Attunement. This is a line that resonates deeply through the abstract process. The serendipity of being in the right place at the right time.\nThis is a resonance to the 46th hexagram whose theme is to recognize that one is in the right place at the right time. To be in the right place at the right time means that whatever idea you have is of value in the\nmoment that you have it. This is important for these people to understand.\n\nThe idea process is a gift. It is simply there. The ideas can always be there. Any idea at any given moment has its value, but not for you. It has its value as another, idea, as another perspective on the process.\n\nMoon exalted. The nourishment derived from being with those who share the same goals and aspirations.\nOne of the great concerns of all first lines is whether or not their nature is going to be accepted by the other. Idea people are very concerned about whether anybody is going to have anything to do with their\nideas, which is why idea people can be so fervent. The beginning of a belief system lies here in this gate in this line.\n\nIn the white book: The gift of finding those who will value your ideas. This is the whole thing about idea people. They need to have others who say, \"That is a great idea,\" whether that is a belief in something or\nnot. They are looking for others who will share the idea because they know that it is not a fact and they know that it is not necessarily a truth. What they know is it is an idea. \"Who else wants to go along for the\nexperience? Maybe there is a crisis, but misery likes company. Lets all do it together.\"\n\nWhen you get to the other side you have: The sense that no one will value your ideas. This is the foundation of what ideas are all about: an idea is only of value it you can share it with others. An idea is a\n\nPage 1\n\npainful thing when nobody values it. This is the whole thing about idea people. They are constantly searching, not simply for a new idea, but they are searching for others who will share the idea with them.\nWhen I discuss the mystical channels, I talk about the 40/37 which is a mystical bridge; it is not mystical in itself. It is all about the search. It is all about curiosity. In many ways, it mirrors this collective channel\nof the 1 1/56. The 1 1/56 is deeply social. The opiate of the masses. A belief system is intended to explode out of a social environment where other people are there sharing the idea and saying, \"Yes.\" As we well\nknow, ideas can be very dangerous in this way.\n\nThe lower trigram always has difficulty in terms of the other side. The lower trigram is more involved in understanding the nature of its own process and yet, here in this channel, through this gate, there is this\nenormous pressure to socialize because the ideas are of no value unless they are shared with others."

      "heading": "Rigor",
      "raw": "The second line is a line of projection. This is the great line of boredom. Boredom is inherent in the idea process and this line is a great line of boredom due to the fact that it is extremely difficult to get anybody\nto pay attention to your ideas. You are projecting ideas out without the value of introspection. That is the first thing.\n\nThis line is called Rigor. The recognition that without vigilance and risk, peace can lead to stagnation and collapse. Neptune exalted. The imagination applied to ensuring the understanding of achieved values. It is\nvery important for these people to recognize that their ideas are much better kept within themselves because then they can lead to the fruit that is very creative.\n\nThis is a very creative line; it has an enormous potential in terms of creativity. These are the bored artists.\nThey are even bored with their own art at times because it depends on who is there in their life to recognize it with them. When they have a nice idea, the moment they try to project that out to others,\nothers are bored. \"That is not my idea. Don't bore me with that.\" It is very difficult for them to project their ideas out to others who say, \"This is boring\". It is much better for them to work with their ideas\nwithin themselves as an imaginative process.\n\nMars in detriment. The resorting to factionalism to satisfy the ego's need for action. It is like sitting with a group of friends and bringing out exactly the idea that will cause three of them to end up in a big\nargument with each other while you sit back after throwing out the idea. Instead of them being bored, you have to watch them getting all cranked up, so you end up being bored.\n\nA sense of boredom overcome through the imagination; or Provoking with ideas to escape boredom. By the way, the only time that they are not boring is when they are cranking other people up."

      "heading": "The Realist",
      "raw": "Whenever you get to a third line of an abstract process, remember, it resonates deeply to the emotional side. You are dealing with bonds made and broken. You are dealing with an emotional wave in which\ncontact is being made and broken and The Realist is about the nature of ideas itself.\n\nThe acknowledgement that peace is transitory. This is the nature of the format energy that runs a circuit. It is called beginnings, middles and ends. Ideas are transitory. Pluto exalted. The internal renewal to\nmaintain strength and alertness. Venus in detriment. The tendency to appreciate harmony to the point of delusion. The belief that beauty is eternal. Fiddling while Rome burns. What is so classic about third lines\nis not only that they make bonds and break them, but they can be very irresponsible in all that. This is the great irresponsible idea machine.\n\nPage 2\n\nThe realization that ideas come and go. These are people where ideas are always coming and going and, due to that, there is a part of them that will never take any of them seriously. They may produce\nabsolutely brilliant ideas. It is others that will take them seriously. They rarely take their own ideas seriously because ideas come and go.\n\nA pleasure in ideas that have no real application: Somebody who has an idea about flying to the alpha century to talk to the booboos. This kind of idea does not mean anything. \"W uldn't it be a great idea to\nhave a building that is 18 miles high?\" These people love ideas that simply have no application whatsoever. It is just for the beauty of what an idea is.\n\nAfter all, we have an enormous privilege to have this kind of consciousness. The horror of this is when we take all that stuff seriously. The moment you take ideas seriously, there will be crisis. In this\nirresponsibility lies this enormous beauty of what the idea itself is. You do not have to do anything with it. You don't have to have anybody agree with you. It is just the beauty of what an idea can be. It can be\ninfuriating to others, particularly when it is your parent. You have all these ideas and they say to you, \"You must do something with it.\" One day you have the idea to be a plastic surgeon on Mars and then you\nend up being an agriculturist in Thailand because the idea changed. Ideas come and go. When you have a lover with this line who tells you, \"let's go on vacation tomorrow,\" don't pack."

      "heading": "The Teacher",
      "raw": "When you get to the fourth line and the upper trigram, something very special happens here. After all, this channel is intensely social and there is enormous frustration in the first three lines about not really being\nsuccessful at crossing the line to get to the point of stimulation in the 56th gate in order to find the believers. In this line, we come to externalization and to this very fixed one-track process. Here it is very\nfixed on a single idea and very fixed on its ability to look across and know how to stimulate.\n\nThere is a quality and a capacity here to stimulate. This line is called The Teacher. It is one of several lines that have more than two planets fixing it and so it is unusual in that nature itself.\n\nThe ability to express the essential nature of peace. Remember that the tradition of the teacher has been based on teaching the ignorant. They have to believe first. When you are teaching a child and it has no\nreal experience in the world, it cannot know or understand what you are teaching. It has to believe you first until it finds out for itself. Most of us come to a point in our lives where, through teachers, we always\nfound disillusionment.\n\nWhat we were asked to believe from the teachers in our lives, our parents or our formal teachers, in many circumstances, we came to the point of disillusionment, that what we thought we were being taught was\nof value, instead turned out to be an illusion. The reality is that it is the tradition of the teacher is to first get them to believe. This is a very Piscean field and we are going through a process where this is\nchanging.\n\nMoon exalted. The sage who in the extreme can teach harmony to the tone deaf. Venus is also exalted.\nThe ability to reach out and touch the alienated. Finally, the Sun in detriment. The guru whose most valued wisdom is intentionally limited to a few.\n\nIn the Book of Letters, it is very clear: Concepts which are clear and transferable. Ideas that can attract and inform the uneducated. These are great missionaries. All religious dogma is here. This is the gate of\nwhite magic and these are the great exponents of white magic: narrow minded, locked in their own track and, though they can be brilliant, they can also be very dangerous because they have the power to attract\n\nPage 3\n\nthe other side. They have the power to get others to say, \"I believe\". This is one of most dogmatic of all gates and this is the nature of white magic. If everybody believes, Tinkerbell won't die.\n\nIdeas that can only be grasped by a few This is the nature of the guru in the sense that there are only some who are capable of understanding. The best example is Einstein because he wrote this theory of relativity\nin 1904 nearly a hundred years ago now and there are still maybe three of four thousand people on earth who understand anything of it. This is information intentionally limited to a few. There are only some\npeople who are able to grasp it.\n\nThis is also the most dangerous of the gurus. These are the people that really attract a fringe and only that fringe can understand that they are an reincarnation of Jesus Christ and the world is coming to an end and\n\"Let's die tomorrow while we take poison.\" This can be a line that is devastating in its power because it is in this line that the capacity of the modern human mind awakened.\n\nI taught many of you that we had a throat chakra mutation that took place 80,000 to 90,000 years ago.\nThat mutation took place in the 12.4. Exactly opposite that line in the zodiac is the 11.4. This opened up the whole possibility of the mind and the possibility to begin the process of articulating ideas. This has\nhad enormous influence in the world ever since. Anybody who is born with either the Sun/Earth or the nodes in the 11.4 has the 12.4 on the other side and this is the line of the prophet. This is a very powerful\nopposition. It has caused as much pain as it has caused glory. That is its nature. \"Believe in me and you shall be redeemed.\""

      "raw": "When you come to the fifth line you, always come to the complete expression of the hexagram. You come to a line of universalization. This gives you the best quality for the nature of this hexagram. It is called\nThe Philanthropist.\n\nThe motiveless nurturing of the disenfranchised to ensure harmony. Mercury in detriment. The withdrawing from direct contact, where giving is a form of defense. The philanthropist is about giving\naway your ideas. One side of this is philosophic and humanitarian ideas, ideas that may be of value to others because the most important ideas are those that enable us to share the human experience and to be\na guide for others.\n\nOn the other side of this are often people who end up being philosophical writers. This is classic for the philosopher: \"Don't come near me personally but let me give you my ideas through a book or a movie.\"\nThat way of doing it is away from the individual contact. Whenever I see anybody who has this line, I always give them a simple thing to think about: when somebody is bothering them, they can give them a\ngood idea. \"Why don't you go out and play, Johnny?\" Give them an idea and send them away. That is what the defensive part is all about.\n\nBy the time you get to the fifth line, you realize that the whole nature of having the 11th gate is that how the idea comes out is never up to you. It is always up to the other side because the 56 is manifesting it.\nThere is this sense of, \"I can be very philanthropic. I have a wonderful idea for you.\" That can be something that is very beneficial or it can be something that is very protective."

      "heading": "Adaptability",
      "raw": "When you come to the sixth line, you come to the roof of the house. You come to transition and this line speaks of transition. It is called Adaptability. The inner balance to accept transition.\n\nPage 4\n\nNeptune exalted. The innate awareness that all forms are transitory. This is the resonance to the third line,\nThe Realist. The Realist begins this process and recognizes that ideas come and go. This is more than that. It is the expression of ideas. After all, the sixth line goes far beyond what is there in the channel. It\ngoes to the whole experience of the circuit. It is looking beyond that to the nature of life itself. What it is looking at is 'the innate awareness that all forms are transitory'.\n\nJupiter in detriment. Adaptability in its most negative manifestation. The speculator who profits at the expense of others in times of peace or war. The greatest difficulty for idea people is to live out their own\nideas. The sixth line people have a sense for what the whole process is about. They can see when the crisis is coming. They can see where the beginning of something is. They can be very lucky in the stock\nmarket. They can see when something is coming to an end and they can be very lucky in terms of getting in and out of things.\n\nSomething lies within them that allows them to take the moment and capture it and to be able to profit from their idea in that moment. But their idea is not about manifesting in the throat. That idea is far\nbeyond that. It is seeing how something operates throughout the whole collective process and being able to catch it and take advantage of it. They realize that any old idea won't do that. Ideas come and go and\nthey are changeable.\n\nThe realization that ideas lead to change and are changeable; or The realization of what idea is of value in any situation. It is the situation that these people look at, not the manifestation; it is the whole situation.\nThey are tuning into that whole possibility. What is actually going on there and what idea can really work in that? Many people will take offense at these people, obviously. They always take advantage in certain\nsituations with an idea, and ideas are not truths. Due to that, other people can see themselves as being taken advantage of. That is always the dichotomy that exists.\n\nThe sixth line is going towards the 10.1, which is all about behavior. That is why what it is looking for over the roof is how everybody acts. Out of seeing the way in which the world behaves, they get their\nideas of how they can take advantage of that behavior.\n\nI don't mean to make that negative. That is not moralistic. Please understand me. It is simply that they take advantage for their own benefit. All those ideas are supposed to be for others. In the detriment the\nidea is really for you. By the way, you ask these people, for example, \"How did you know when to step out of the stock market. How did you get this idea?\" They cannot really tell you. They tell you something\nthat does not really sound related at all to the question. They simply tell you, \"Well, women's' dresses are shorter this year.\" Whether you consider that answer as their real idea or as something that just flashes\ninto their mind makes no difference.\n\nAfter all, we have no choice in what we say anyway. The speculator is born with this gift and has the experience. The people who have the gift end up in situations surrounded by people who do not have the\ngift. They follow their trends. The world is filled with people who try to figure out how Mr. Buffet made his 16 billion dollars. When you hear him talk about it, it is a joke. These people have the gift of\ncomparison. They wouldn't tell their mother if they knew what stock to buy because they would be afraid that their mother would tell their friend and ruin the whole thing.\n\nPage 5"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 11 PEACE\n\nAbove the lines of the Rave I'Ching it says: A harmonic condition in the individual or society that permits assessment before renewed action.

Here we have the\ngate of ideas and the possibility: awareness to visualize a realization or not. This is visual memory of the left eye.\n\nThink about how the left eye works: it does not see everything. It sees just what is there in the wave. If you are a left-eye person and you go on a vacation and you stay in a place with a beautiful view and you\nlove it very much, then you get home and somebody says to you, \"What was it like?\" When you describe it, there will be many things left out.\n\nThere is a place in your wave and the part of what you saw that you really like is the part you hold on to.\nThen somebody who knows the place says, \"Wait a minute. Wasn't there a river that went through there?\" and you answer, \"Oh yes, there was a river. Now I remember.\" It is in a wave.

They can see when something is coming to an end and they can be very lucky in terms of getting in and out of things.\n\nSomething lies within them that allows them to take the moment and capture it and to be able to profit from their idea in that moment. But their idea is not about manifesting in the throat. That idea is far\nbeyond that. It is seeing how something operates throughout the whole collective process and being able to catch it and take advantage of it. They realize that any old idea won't do that. Ideas come and go and\nthey are changeable.\n\nThe realization that ideas lead to change and are changeable; or The realization of what idea is of value in any situation. It is the situation that these people look at, not the manifestation; it is the whole situation.\nThey are tuning into that whole possibility. What is actually going on there and what idea can really work in that? Many people will take offense at these people, obviously. They always take advantage in certain\nsituations with an idea, and ideas are not truths. Due to that, other people can see themselves as being taken advantage of. That is always the dichotomy that exists.\n\nThe sixth line is going towards the 10.1, which is all about behavior. That is why what it is looking for over the roof is how everybody acts. Out of seeing the way in which the world behaves, they get their\nideas of how they can take advantage of that behavior.\n\nI don't mean to make that negative. That is not moralistic. Please understand me. It is simply that they take advantage for their own benefit. All those ideas are supposed to be for others. In the detriment the\nidea is really for you. By the way, you ask these people, for example, \"How did you know when to step out of the stock market. How did you get this idea?\" They cannot really tell you. They tell you something\nthat does not really sound related at all to the question. They simply tell you, \"Well, women's' dresses are shorter this year.\" Whether you consider that answer as their real idea or as something that just flashes\ninto their mind makes no difference.\n\nAfter all, we have no choice in what we say anyway. The speculator is born with this gift and has the experience. The people who have the gift end up in situations surrounded by people who do not have the\ngift. They follow their trends. The world is filled with people who try to figure out how Mr. Buffet made his 16 billion dollars. When you hear him talk about it, it is a joke. These people have the gift of\ncomparison. They wouldn't tell their mother if they knew what stock to buy because they would be afraid that their mother would tell their friend and ruin the whole thing.\n\nPage 5",

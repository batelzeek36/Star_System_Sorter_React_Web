  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 38 OPPOSITION\n\nWe come to the individual process: the 38th hexagram, Opposition, the polarity of the 39th hexagram,\nObstruction. These gates are deeply similar in the nature of their pressure. At the same time, they are pointed towards different outlets. The 38th gate is pointed towards the splenic system and this channel,\nthe 28/38, has to do with the development of our intuitive processes. The 38th gate is the gate of the fighter and the fuel is the energy to struggle or not. This is the inherent energy.\n\nI always try to stress to the people that carry the 38th energy that the only struggle that is worthwhile is the struggle that tells you that life is of value because that is inherently what the struggle is all about, that\nlife is truly of value. That is why you have risk-taking at the other end.\n\nThe energy mechanic is the impulse coming out of the format of the 3/60 to ignore. There is nothing more exquisite than a 38 ignoring you. They ignore you; they do not hear you. You talk to them and 10 minutes\nlater, they look at you and say, \"Were you talking to me?\" They are in their own process. This is a fuel or a pressure -energy of the individual process.\n\nAbove the lines it says: The ability to preserve individual integrity trough opposition to detrimental forces. 'Individual integrity.' It is about the value of the individual life, not the value of the collective or\nthe communal, tribal life. It is the value of the individual life. If you scratch any seeker, they will all ask you the same question, \"What is my purpose in life?\" At the core, to be individual is this need to\nrecognize value in your own life.\n\n38.1 Qualification\n\nThe first line always acts as a guide to the essential meaning of the hexagram. This foundation line is called Qualification. There is something very beautiful in this. This is a fuel, a pressure -energy, which is\nspeaking for the whole hexagram and you can see that, right from the beginning, the intuitive process carries something that we call psychic phenomena.\n\nTempering opposition based on circumstances. Don't always strugglel Don't always fightl The line is saying to only struggle and fight for those things that are of value. Otherwise, don't bother.\n\nNeptune exalted. Nine times in the 384 lines we find a first line, a foundation that has Neptune as its exaltation. The foundation of what you fight for is veiled. The very basis of this hexagram is hidden. It is\nhidden in the mysteriousness of mutation and the mutative capacity of anything individual. What is of value to fight for can be an enormous mystery in life. Most people don't know.\n\nA psychic attunement that guarantees proper action. 'Proper action' in the sense of what to struggle for or not, when to struggle or not, when to listen or not.\n\nIn the white book: The psychic gift of knowing when and how to fight. Which means, with Neptune here, it is just there. That is where it gets its psychic label because it appears mysteriously from behind the veil\nand suddenly, in a noxious situation, where nothing is going on, the 38.1 finds itself engaged and struggling. They don't know why because it is a psychic moment. It is coming from behind the veil.\n\nMars in detriment. The tendency to oppose as a general rule. This is also the nature of what is inherent in\nOpposition. The drive to fight as a general rule. \"Get out of my way. I am doing it my way.\" The individual is not designed to be influenced. This is one of the most important things to understand about\nthe nature of individuality.\n\nPage 1\n\nWherever you see an individual gate in your design, recognize that that is an aspect of your nature that is not to be influenced by others. That is why, at the core of what the pressure is, it is to be intuitively\npenetrating and aware in the now through the 57/20. But at the root of that, it is to fight anybody that gets in your way, right, wrong, or indifferent. The key is: is it really of value for you to fight about that? As a\nfirst line, this is the true struggle. What is worth fighting for is the great question of the 38. 1.\n\n38.2 Politeness\n\nThe second line has a very deceptive name; very few people really grasp it. All second lines are about projecting outwards but they do not have the depth. This is not a question of what the struggle is or what\none has to struggle about. This is just a projection outwards that one is a struggler and that one is a fighter.\n\nThis projection outwards comes under this title of Politeness. Don't misunderstand this. This does not mean that these people do not struggle. It just means that they struggle all the time and it is polite. \"Please\nstop doing that. I don't want you to do that anymore. Please.\" They can drive you crazy with their politeness.\n\nOpposition that does not transgress normal codes of behavior. Pluto exalted. The value of discretion. In the white book it says: The energy for the intuitive awareness for discretion. These people try to keep the\nstruggle from getting out of hand. They don't want the big fight. They just very carefully coach everything in nice polite terms and you know right away that they are struggling with you, but they are polite, so they\nsurvive.\n\nThink about what is at the other end. In the 28th gate, we have the fear of death. I know so many 28's and\n38's who have been beaten and robbed in their life. They bring struggle into the world and they get it back. The 38.2 knows that and so, they struggle on politely. This is the framework that will lead to the\nuniversalization in the fifth line: they struggle politely.\n\nMoon in detriment. An over-politeness that is both servile and obviously superficial and defeats its very purpose. These people kill you with their politeness. \"Oh, yes I will do this for you.\" They can drive you\ncrazy with the way in which they express it.\n\nThe energy for over-politeness in times of struggle. The fear of dying, the fear of being beaten, destroyed, and broken is very powerful in this gate. If you are a fighter, you know what the fight is. The fight is to\nthe death. This lies underneath every 38: the recognition that the fight is to the death. The struggle is to the death.\n\n38.3 Alliance\n\nThe third line is a joke. The moment that you understand what third lines are about (bonds made and broken, trial and error), the idea that this line is called Alliance is very funny because you know that\ninherent in these alliances is the fact that they will fall apart. They will fall apart because the individual ultimately struggles alone. This is the whole thing.\n\nIn the end, by the time you get into the integration system, the one thing that is clear is that everyone is alone. Individuals know this intensely. That is why it is so important for them to recognize in their\nlifetime what their individual value is. They know that they are alone and they ask themselves: Is it worth it?\n\nPage 2\n\nSun exalted. The ability to sustain through integration with similar forces, thus ensuring the vitality to persevere. Please understand what that means. \"I am struggling against that person in the neighborhood\nand I will struggle with that person for the rest of my life on my own. If it happens that my next door neighbor is also struggling with that person, I will go along with my next door neighbor and we will\nstruggle together.\" That is never really an alliance. It is the alliance in the way in which the English and the French army will fight together, but they only do so if they have a common enemy. When they do not\nhave one, they will fight each other because that is the nature of the individual.\n\nIn the white book: The energy to integrate with others in times of struggle, as long as it is the same struggle, as long as it is focused on the same thing or pointed towards the same thing.\n\nWe have the Earth in detriment. Here you see one of these Sun/Earth polarities. These lines are important.\nEarth in detriment. Selfish alliance which saps the energy of one's partners in order to ensure personal vitality. \"I am struggling with my neighbor and my neighbor is struggling with my neighbor. I will let my\nneighbor do most of the struggling so I can save my energy. When my neighbor burns out, then I will jump in the right moment and finish it off.\" This is the third line.\n\n38.4 Investigation\n\nWhen you get to the fourth and fifth lines, you get to the inherently social lines. Nothing about the individual is inherently social. At the top of the lines, it says: The ability to preserve individual integrity\nthrough opposition to detrimental forces. The 'detrimental force' is anyone who tries to influence the individual. So, when you look at the inherent sociability of the fourth and fifth lines, please understand\nthat that is only going to come from an appropriate individual. It will have to come from another individual, in essence from the 28th gate at the other end. In other words, individuals do not influence\neach other. They empower each other or not, but they do not influence each other. They empower each other to live out their own individuality and, in that, as long as they are empowering each other, a trust\ncan develop between the two of them.\n\nThis is the line of Investigation: the single-mindedness, the focus of the individual to struggle for what is of value in life. Analysis which strengthens opposition. Pluto exalted. The detective who develops or the\ninsider who accepts a joint opposition whose success can only be based on trust. In the white book: The energy to recognize who can be of value in times of struggle.\n\nThe 38 is a pressure and the pressure needs to be released. Its natural pathway obviously leads to the 28.\nWhen a 38 and a 28 have an electro-magnetic connection to each other, in that moment, it is possible to align with each other. It is possible to trust and struggle together out of empowerment for each other. That\n\"who\" is the very important element. Who is that person that you can trust to not influence but empower you? This is the key in the fourth line.\n\nMars in detriment. The power of adrenaline to provoke aggressiveness. In the black book: The aggressiveness in opposition that prejudices investigation and limits trustworthiness. The thing to\nrecognize about this line is that these are some of the most aggressive individuals that we have in terms of maintaining their individual integrity. The slightest attempt to influence them will get the strongest\npossible reaction because that is what they are here for. Because of that, even another individual can bring out an aggressive reaction in 38.4's. We are complex beings. They may meet a 28 who is basically\ncollective but they have the 28 to their 38. That basic collective part is not going to empower, but to share. It wants to make judgments. It wants to correct. It wants to say, \"No, let us not do it this way. Let\nus do it that way. \" In that instant, you get violence as a potential because the aggressiveness will say, \"No, no, my way. \"\n\nPage 3\n\nWhat you have here in the fourth line is a very fixed energy on being able to establish if life is worthwhile or not, a genetic possibility to recognize who can empower you to fulfill that recognition. Because of the\nstrength of this, there is also the possibility that nobody will have it. There is this constant aggressive defense against being influenced by the outside. My son has the fourth line twice with Neptune. The way\nin which that comes out is very bizarre. Telling him that he should do something does not work. He just does not listen. He looks like saying, \"Who the hell are you to tell me anything?\" I was sitting in a cafe\nand he was about to go across the street and as he left I said to him, \"Be careful.\" Before he gets to the crossing, he turns around and says, \"I know what I am doing.\" He is only five years old. These are 38's.\nDon't get in their way.\n\n38.5 Alienation\n\nWe will see when we look at the 39.5 as the polarity on the other side, because it is projected on these people that they are provocative, that they are basically left alone. The same thing is true when you come\nto this fifth line with its appropriate name Alienation. Remember that the fifth line is how the public or the outside world sees a hexagram. So, the outside world sees the 38 as an alienated being, somebody\nwho is fighting in their own world, somebody who is really not connected to the rest because they seem to be caught up in some kind of struggle about something. This energy is seen as alienating energy by the\noutside.\n\nA stage in opposition where one is totally isolated. This is the universalization of the pressure to be individually intuitive. It is absolutely perfect. The individual is always at their best when they are isolated\nwithin the aloneness of their own being because they have to resolve everything in life within their own context. They are individual.\n\nSaturn exalted. The ambition and concentration to endure. These are very tough folks. You project on them that they can fight and they are there. They are always ready for the struggle. It gets projected on\nthem all the time, so they are deeply trained in life for what the struggle can be.\n\nThe energy to stubbornly fight alone. This is their magic, in that sense. Their magic is that they do not need to have others with them in their struggle because, in fact, their struggle can be of value to others.\nThey are often groundbreakers because they are given the opportunity to struggle for what is really of value. They often get to be the people that first discover the value of something because they are given the\nopportunity to struggle.\n\nPluto in detriment. Alienation experienced as painful confinement that by its very nature blinds one to the possibility that there are those at some point who may come to one's aid. In the white book: The energy\nfor stubbornness is so strong that it is difficult to recognize that there are others who can help in times of struggle. It is about alienation. Even in its detriment, where there is always this possibility that there may\nbe somebody else (after all, there is the 28th gate at the other side), there is still this sense that one is always alone. The difference is what all individuals have to live out in their process. They have to go\nthrough the binary of what aloneness is. This binary of aloneness for the individual is that half of the time it is delicious and half of the time it is not. This is what lies in alienation.\n\nThe exalted says, \"It is great to fight alone. I only have to deal with my resources, my process, with what is of value to me. I don't have to concern myself with anybody else.\" The other side says, \"I have to fight\nalone. Isn't this awful? Nobody will help me. Nobody cares about my struggle. Nobody empowers me.\"\nThey always have this feeling that they have to do it alone. It is true. You have to do it alone. Somebody can help you to get to the door but you have to go through the door yourself. The 38 is always going to\nneed that doorway of the 28. It cannot be fulfilled by itself. The 38 is only a pressure.\n\nPage 4\n\nRemember that how the lines manifest is entirely dependent on the design. Again, you cannot take any of the meanings of these lines and project on them until you see them directly in context to the design. How\nthey will come out and how they actually operate, that will make the difference. If you have the 38.5 and you have no outlet for it, you will feel alienated within yourself because it is so difficult to bring it out.\nAgain, all of these lines have to be seen in the context of the design.\n\n38.6 Misunderstanding\n\nEach of these gates that come out the root center and point towards the splenic center have very unusual,\nUranian lines. We will see the 58.1, the Love of life. We will see the 54.4 which is the mystical line of\nEnlightenment/Endarkenment, and here we come to the 38.6. This unusual line is the quality that exists in this individual process. The 38.6 has a direct resonance to the 20.6 that is going from the fuel to the\nexpression. The expression in the 20.6, in the throat, is Wisdom, wisdom in the now that is of value to society and to civilization. The 38.6 is one of the most potentially mutative of all gates in the individual\nprocess. The only lines that are intrinsically more mutative are the lines that you will find in the 3rd hexagram. In other words, what you are seeing here in this particular line is a mutative force. It is a\nmutative force and, because mutation will always bring something new, that mutative force is always misunderstood.\n\nIt is so difficult for individuals, even when they have the opportunity at the mental level, to explain themselves. When you are dealing with a fuel, with a pressure in the 38.6, there is this fundamental\nknowing of what is worth struggling for or, as is more often the case, what not to struggle for. There is always this misunderstanding from the outside because it does not seem to fit into any kind of recognized\npattern from the past.\n\nOpposition without basis. Saturn exalted. Eventual crystallization that clears up misunderstandings.\nEventual'!\n\nIn the white book, it says: Energy which attracts misunderstanding and the stubbornness to face opposition. These people know something that other people don't know. They still don't know what it\nmeans and they don't know how to express it. It is just something inside. They can seem like they are fighting for something and nobody can understand why they are fighting and what they are fighting about\nand they themselves often have no idea why they are struggling and fighting. That is the nature of the\n38.6. But there is always eventual crystallization. In other words, because it is a mutative process, eventually the mutation can take hold and, in that moment that the mutation gets to manifest, gets\nexpressed or generated, in that moment, it is possible to recognize what the struggle has been for. Then all those people around them that were struggling with them will let go and the struggle will end.\n\nWhen you come to the Earth in detriment, you have: The recognition that misunderstanding is at the root of opposition, but the insistence that it is the misunderstanding of the opposing forces. The detriment is\nmore mutative than the exalted. It will actually struggle for something and it does not know why it is struggling for it for all of its life, despite what anybody tries to tell them, because so deep is that force\ninside that the mutation of knowing is the only way that they will find value. 38.6 people are often tormented by the fact that the knowing of others is never a knowing that is sufficient for them because the\nvalue of life for them lies in a knowing that no one seems to have access to and only they seem to have a recognition of, inside of themselves, but do not know what it is. The 38.6 does not fight. They do not\nengage in struggle. Their struggle is all held within because nobody understands them.\n\nThere is a very clear description of this in the keynote. The keynote does not belong to individuality.\nMisunderstanding. The 38.6 is the bane of the collective. They drive the collective crazy. The collective can deal with individual knowing that has been around for a while but they have a lot of problems with\n\nPage 5\n\nindividual knowing that is brand new and cannot be explained to them. So, they are up against the wall of struggle that they cannot deal with.\n\nAgain, recognize what the nature of a sixth line is. This line is looking for the quality of the whole circuit.\nIn other words, not only is the knowing finally there that gives value to the life; it also leads to the awareness that gives life its proper form, its proper convictions and brings it out awake in the now to\nmutate all of society. No wonder that they are misunderstood. How difficult a process that is. For all sixth lines in individual gates, it is much more difficult to make any kind of commitment than it is for a\ncollective sixth line. A tribal sixth line can be pulled in relatively quickly. The collective takes a little bit longer, but to bring in the individual sixth line to get a commitment out of these peoplel It has to come out\nof their unique knowing.\n\nPage 6",

The first line of the 23rd hexagram is called Proselytization. The attempt to\nundermine one set of values for another. This word describes a process in which you try to convince other people of what you know.\n\nJupiter exalted. The sage who, in the extreme, can defend evil as a part of the greater good. Venus in detriment. The missionary whose very light will bring darkness. These are the two sides of the individual\nprocess. It is about bringing mutation. The 23rd hexagram is bringing the possibility of mutation as a description of a mental concept. For example:\n\nI am a pure individual. I have am individual mind. I bring the knowing that I have and do the-very best I canto explain iit. The reality its that that either leads to a mutative way in which we think or I will be\nrejected as a freak. These are the two sides of the same coin.\n\nThe powerful expression of an insight which will undermine established values. The Human Design\nSystem undermines a great deal of dogma. On the other side: The powerful expression of an insight which\n\nPage 1\n\nwig produce negative effects. Something that can be mutative can be mutative in a positive or in a negative way.

If you are a black native in the\nheart df Africa and you have a white missionary coming to you and telling you, -NI know that Jesus will save you,\" this cam be ireal pain in the neck, even if the white person is really convinced that he/she does\na very good job of explaining that. One person's knowing cam be very offensive to the collective or-to - the tribe. So, bath sides of these realities dlwnays exist in the 23, which means ilhatthe 23, when it opens\nits mouth and says, \"I know,\" is always open to refection. This is the-other side of the coin."

      "heading": "Self-defense",
      "raw": "When you are dealing with the first line, because you are dealing with a voice that says, \"I'know,\" and explains itself, the first line recognizes that there is knowing within it, but it is looking into the nature of\nthe knowing. When you get to the second line, you are always getting to a line of projection. We know that the second line is going to project out the quality of the gate. The second line is always the child in\nthe classroom that goes, \"I know,\" and that does not mean they do.\n\nThe whole thing about the nature of the individual is that every aspect of individuality that you find in a chart, that aspect has a built-in resistance to interference. This is one of the keys to individual integrity.\nThe key is: fall on your own face and do not take anybody else's advice. The reality is that when you have a child with the 23.2 that is four years old and is yelling at their parents, \"I know,\" it can get them into a\nlot of trouble because they may not really know. They do not have the ability to look inward the way the first line does. They project this knowing out.\n\nThis line is called Self-defense. This is the key to the defense of the individual and it will get its full quality when it resonates to the fifth line where the individual process can be universalized. It says: The\nneed to abandon tolerance when survival is threatened. Survival is a very powerful word and it is talking about the nature of what it is to be an individual. If you are an individual and you know something and\nyou swallow that in the face of the resistance from others, your survival as an individual comes to an end.\nThat is, your capacity to maintain your individual nature deteriorates, and so many people who have the\n23rd gate never express their \"I know\" because they were slapped down when they were children. They were constantly being put in their place and being told, \"You don't know.\"\n\nJupiter exalted. The principle of preservation at its most acute. \"I know, I know, I know,\" and they keep screaming it at the Moon in detriment: Where Jupiter will strike out to preserve its integrity, the Moon is\noften satisfied with just protecting itself by fending off hostility. This is the beginning of the individual deteriorating. The moment the individual is concerned about harmony is the moment that deterioration\ncomes into their individuality. This is very difficult for people who have a lot of individual definition in their design because it is very hard for them, genetically speaking, to be able to accept the input from\nothers. Yet, built into this, like all the dualities and the polarities in Design, is an inherent weakness within the individual: the fear of being rejected, the fear that their contribution to the totality cannot be\nmade.\n\nIn the white book it says: The abandonment of tolerance when individual expression is threatened. These are people that insist on getting out their \"I know,\" on projecting that knowing out.\n\nOn the other hand: The defense of individual expression in the face of hostility. This is the moment where, for example, in the process of a child who has a knowing inside of them, because they have been\ntold in the past that they don't know, rather than saying what they do know, they are more concerned in keeping everybody happy around them. \"I don't want to be treated like a freak so I'd better not tell them\nwhat I know.\"\n\nPage 2\n\nYou notice, by the way, that when I make these references in how this is lived out, I am very often referring to children. It is very important to understand that, by the time you get to be an adult, you are\nalready so deeply conditioned so far away from your nature. The reality is that this kind of knowledge, ultimately, is for children so that their process can be healthy and so the people that raise these children\ncan have a deep recognition of the nature of what is there.\n\nCollective children do not have the same kind of difficulties in dealing with criticism because they are born to be critical themselves and they are born to share the nature of criticism. This is part of the process\nof being collective, through experience and experimentation. The tribal child has a contact with those around him that is very deep and supportive even when it is difficult because there is a much deeper bond\nin the relationship. But when you are dealing with an individual child or aspects of individuality in a child, because they are different and they do not function in those ways, they are deeply sensitive to\ncriticism. The criticism at the child's level in the individual child is something that will inhibit their capacity and their security to be able to express their individuality."

It is, in this sense, the archetype of the individual process, that the individual knower cannot really be of value,\ncannot really bring wisdom, unless that knower makes a lot of mistakes. All third lines are about adaptation. Knowing can be a very fixed process and the reality is that the knower who goes through a\nmistake process and comes to grips with that process of trial and error and adaptation, that the nature of their individuality, the power of their ability to explain themselves, grows.\n\nWhenever I deal with individuals, I always remind them that it is very important for them to develop language skills.

When Pluto was in the 43rd gate, which took place in 1990, I went through this process of having everybody deal with me as a black magician who is crazy and dangerous.\nIt made a lot of people very uncomfortable. This is simply the nature of it.\n\nThere is a whole generation of children being born with Pluto in that position and, when they grow up, they will not like me. What to do? By the way, the children that were born just after that generation have\nNeptune in 61 and I have my Design Sun in 6 Occult knowledge, and Neptune is exalted there. So the children that are a little bit younger than the other generation will like me. It balances out in the end."

      "heading": "Fragmentation",
      "raw": "We are in the upper trigram, which is about externalizing. It is the recognition that there is something across the way. There is a recognition that one has to deal with it in a transpersonal way. It is about being\nfixed in the sense of being one-tracked and it says here, Fragmentation. Diversification without a perceived potential for synthesis. These are knowing-junkies. They move from one knowing to another\n\nPage 3\n\nand there is no way for them in which those disparate, diverse knowings add up to something. Due to the fact that there is no potential for synthesis, there is simply a collection of knowing.\n\nSun exalted. Fatalism and egoism and damn the consequences. When these people get into their knowing trip, it is all they can externalize, even if it has nothing to do with anything else. These people simply\nwant to get that knowing out and externalize it. They have a one-track mind. That is the resonance, by the way, to the 43.4, the One-track mind.\n\nThe other side of this is the Earth in detriment. Atheism and paranoia. Individuals that simply put out knowing that is of no value to the collective, individual expression that has no collective value. If the\ncollective is not interested in what the knower has to say, the knower is going to be shunned. So the knower then shifts to the next knowing, but it still has no value to the collective because it is an individual\nknowing process in which they are fixed.\n\nWhen you come to the detriment side, to the atheism and paranoia, to these kinds of knowers, knowing is all about three things: knowing what you can know, recognizing what is not worth knowing and being\nclear about what is unknowable. These people, because they are into so much knowing, they see that nothing really is of value. Because of that and because the outside world is going to appear to be cruel to\nthem because they are going to be rejected by it, they can become very paranoid about releasing their knowing, very paranoid about the way that they see people coming towards them. The fear of that\nrejection and that paranoia becomes paranoia that there is no cosmic protection either, that there is no God to hear their prayer anymore than there is an individual or a person out there willing to hear and take in\ntheir knowing.\n\nAgain, it is so easy for human beings to be moralistic, and the moment that you get a description of a line like that, it is so easy to jump on that. \"Aha, this is not good.\" It is not about that. This, after all, is the gate\nof Amorality. It is not about the morality of the line. For every single line and for every single aspect, you will have a value. One of those bizarre funny knowings that the fourth line can get into in their one-track\ntrip is that it can ultimately turn out to be of enormous value. It is just difficult for them to get that out and they are very uncomfortable inside because there is this deep fear of rejection.\n\nRemember, the individual process (to say, \"I know\"), always places you at risk because if you can't explain it, you are a fool or worse. So, here in the fourth line, with all of this movement and diversity,\nthere is not enough depth for a real explanation, and the depth does not permit the synthesis. And so, out of that can come a great deal of anxiety. \"They are never going to know what I mean.\" This is the real fear\nin the 23. The fourth line is the one that lives out pure individuality because they simply put their knowing out and do not pay any attention to the consequences. They just don't care. But they do. This is\nvery disturbing for them."

      "heading": "Assimilation",
      "raw": "Remember that the first line always gives you the basis or the nature of the hexagram but the fifth line always tells you the way the world looks at it. The fifth line is in resonance to the second line, which\nprojects out, and the fifth line is projected on. What is projected onto the fifth line is that it is there to be assimilated and to assimilate. This is one of the keys to the individual and it also shows you the pressure\nthat comes from the outside that is placed on the individual. \"Yes, you are very interesting, but be like us.\nYou might know something but you'd better behave the way we behave because, otherwise, you will have problems with us.\" The individual cannot survive in the world without some capacity for assimilation.\n\nThe practical acceptance of the values of another path. Jupiter exalted. Expansion and contribution through assimilation. There is no way for the individual to survive and allow its gifts to penetrate into the\n\nPage 4\n\nworld without this gift of being able to assimilate, without this gift of being able to find some way socially to integrate oneself into the community.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. Motive -driven assimilation from an inferior position, i.e., for protection or nourishment. These are people that really trade off their knowing. This is the individual that will sell out\ntheir knowing because they recognize that the assimilation is so important. Remember that everybody is projecting onto the 23.5 that they know. Because of that, the outside also wants them to bring that\nknowing out, even if they can't explain themselves. The moment that they can't explain themselves, all that falls apart.\n\nSo, here in the white book, the Jupiter side is: The gift of communicating individual insight to the collective. Here is the gift of reaching out to the collective through assimilation. On the other side, we\nhave: Motive driven assimilation for acceptance and protection from the collective. \"I will be nice to them. I am not going to tell them what I know. I want them to like me. I don't want them to throw me out.\nA couple of years from now, maybe, when they really do accept me I'll tell them what I know.\"\n\nThis is what usually happens with the fifth line and again, the nature of how somebody can express their individuality is almost exclusively conditioned by their culture, by their family environment when they\nwere young, usually within the first seven years. The impact of how you are conditioned by the outside world when you are an individual child has enormous impact for the rest of your life, whether or not you\nare going to have the courage to be able to express your \"I know\", or whether you spend all of your time being concerned about being accepted by the society around you.\n\nThe vast majority of individuality on this planet is more concerned about being accepted and not being rejected by the totality' than they are aboutestablishingi their knowing in the world. As you can see from\nthis projected pressure from the outside, theigreatest'presswre on the individual is to assimilate. Once you have established the value of your knowing,, after that, you have to be like everybody else."

      "heading": "Fusion",
      "raw": "When you come to the sixth line, to the end of the process, you come to this place of transition.. As we.\nhave seen already, it is rare fop the sixth line to be actively involved in the process of the hexagram because it is so interested) in what is going on in the whole circuit. When you are dealing with the\ncircuitry of Individuality,, yow are dealing with an emormously complex circuitry. The! moment-you are looking owl towards all of that circuitry, what you are really looking owl towards is: Is any knowing of\nvalue if: it does not lead) to m iutatiomt This is the! nature of the sixth line here.. In order for knowing to lead to mutation, this is; a process that comes out of bringing the diversity into synthesis, as a fusion.\n\nThis line is. called Fusion. It says: The! gradual attunement of diversity through synthesis. The! first thing to recognize is that these are indiMidualb that will take the longest time to express their \"I know.\" Built\ninto them is a genetic recognition that each knowing is a block that eventually )builds a structure a this is the channel of Structuring) in which the! knowing is so clear that the! mutation is then possible.\n\nMars exalted. The exponential growth of energy and its power of assertion engendered by fusion. In the white book: Individual knowing which brings diversity through synthesis. But that takes time. These are\nnot the kind of knowers that jump up and say, \"I know, I know.\" There is this sense of knowing in them, but there is also this sense that the knowing is not complete. Knowing is about knowing who you are and\nwhy you are. That is the core of knowing. For the individual, that is the essence for them. That is a complex process because you have to live long enough to be able to get some kind of an impression of\nwhat it is to be in this world, in your own life.\n\nPage 5\n\nJupiter in detriment. The principled but futile withdrawal from fusion that leads to atrophy. This is the sixth line saying, \"I know a lot of things but I don't know what I really need to know and I have had\nenough. It is not possible. How can I find that knowing that will lead to mutation? I have been going through all of these knowings and I don't know how all of that can fit together.\"\n\nIndividual knowing that holds on to diversity and loses its power in expression. The sixth line can only express a knowing that is mutative. Otherwise, it is not really going to bother. Of course, as a child, it will\ngo through the \"I know, I know\" process, like all children that are individual in terms of the mental or throat process, but the reality is that, as they mature in life, they are going to hold back more and more\nand more until they have that opportunity to see the synthetic knowing. If not, they'll wait. We have been looking at how sixth lines move to the next hexagram. We saw how the abstract shifts over to the logic\nand how the logic jumps back over to the abstract, and here, in this individual process, we have this remarkable movement. VWte have this movement that goes from the 23.6 to the 8.1.\n\nThe 8.1 is the very next hexagram and it is the mirror to the 23 because it is out of the 8 that its potential contribution can be made to society, not at a mental level, but in terms of identity and direction.\n\nPage 6"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 23 SPLITTING APART\n\nThere is a difference between the collective process in the throat, with its primary gates of communication, and the individual process. The collective process in the throat is the capacity to be able\nto translate the internal image or concept from the mind into language, into words: to get people in the abstract process to be able to see and make sense out of what you are telling them, or in the logical\nprocess to get people to recognize and understand the facts.\n\nWhen we come to the individual process, it operates differently because the individual mind is acoustic.\nWhenever you see individuality in a chart, what you are looking at is an aspect that operates at an acoustic level. So, rather than trying to translate an image and turn it into language so that you can get people to\nsee what you are talking about, the 23rd gate acts as a legitimate translator, very much like what Jurgen does when he translates me. That is, you take the original inner sound, the inner voice, and find a way to\ntranslate that into a language that allows the individual to explain themselves.\n\nThe channel 43/23, the channel of Structuring, is a design of individuality subtitled: 'from genius to freak.'\nThe individual is always on the outside until they find a way to be able to explain themselves. Unless the individual can explain themselves, they are always going to be placed on the outside. The 23rd gate does\nnot say, \"I believe,\" like the abstract voice. It does not say, \"I think,\" like the logical voice. It says, \"I know,\" or \"I don't know.\" When you say, \"I know,\" you had better be able to explain yourself; if you\ncan't, you will be rejected.\n\nAbove the lines it says, Amorality. It is one of the things to recognize about the nature of the individual process that, contrary to the collective and the tribal processes, which are both moralistic, the individual\nprocess is not. Amorality is the key to the individual process. It is not about what is right or wrong. It is about what one knows or does not know.\n\nThe awareness and understanding that leads to the acceptance of diversity. The difficulty with all individuality is that it seeks to be accepted. It will always attract attention. Because the individual is\ndifferent and brings the potential for a mutative force, the individual can be easily rejected. When the individual becomes moralistic, they are the first to be rejected. The reality is that individuals are simply\ndifferent. It is not about whether it is good or bad.\n\n23.1 Proselytization\n\nThe first line of any hexagram describes the foundation. This is the introspective quality; this is the pure nature of a hexagram. The first line of the 23rd hexagram is called Proselytization. The attempt to\nundermine one set of values for another. This word describes a process in which you try to convince other people of what you know.\n\nJupiter exalted. The sage who, in the extreme, can defend evil as a part of the greater good. Venus in detriment. The missionary whose very light will bring darkness. These are the two sides of the individual\nprocess. It is about bringing mutation. The 23rd hexagram is bringing the possibility of mutation as a description of a mental concept. For example:\n\nI am a pure individual. I have am individual mind. I bring the knowing that I have and do the-very best I canto explain iit. The reality its that that either leads to a mutative way in which we think or I will be\nrejected as a freak. These are the two sides of the same coin.\n\nThe powerful expression of an insight which will undermine established values. The Human Design\nSystem undermines a great deal of dogma. On the other side: The powerful expression of an insight which\n\nPage 1\n\nwig produce negative effects. Something that can be mutative can be mutative in a positive or in a negative way. Thcit iis, this very mutafive force cam seem very offensive. If you are a black native in the\nheart df Africa and you have a white missionary coming to you and telling you, -NI know that Jesus will save you,\" this cam be ireal pain in the neck, even if the white person is really convinced that he/she does\na very good job of explaining that. One person's knowing cam be very offensive to the collective or-to - the tribe. So, bath sides of these realities dlwnays exist in the 23, which means ilhatthe 23, when it opens\nits mouth and says, \"I know,\" is always open to refection. This is the-other side of the coin.\n\n23.2 Self-defense\n\nWhen you are dealing with the first line, because you are dealing with a voice that says, \"I'know,\" and explains itself, the first line recognizes that there is knowing within it, but it is looking into the nature of\nthe knowing. When you get to the second line, you are always getting to a line of projection. We know that the second line is going to project out the quality of the gate.

One of those bizarre funny knowings that the fourth line can get into in their one-track\ntrip is that it can ultimately turn out to be of enormous value. It is just difficult for them to get that out and they are very uncomfortable inside because there is this deep fear of rejection.\n\nRemember, the individual process (to say, \"I know\"), always places you at risk because if you can't explain it, you are a fool or worse. So, here in the fourth line, with all of this movement and diversity,\nthere is not enough depth for a real explanation, and the depth does not permit the synthesis. And so, out of that can come a great deal of anxiety. \"They are never going to know what I mean.\" This is the real fear\nin the 23. The fourth line is the one that lives out pure individuality because they simply put their knowing out and do not pay any attention to the consequences. They just don't care. But they do. This is\nvery disturbing for them.\n\n23.5 Assimilation\n\nRemember that the first line always gives you the basis or the nature of the hexagram but the fifth line always tells you the way the world looks at it. The fifth line is in resonance to the second line, which\nprojects out, and the fifth line is projected on. What is projected onto the fifth line is that it is there to be assimilated and to assimilate. This is one of the keys to the individual and it also shows you the pressure\nthat comes from the outside that is placed on the individual. \"Yes, you are very interesting, but be like us.\nYou might know something but you'd better behave the way we behave because, otherwise, you will have problems with us.\" The individual cannot survive in the world without some capacity for assimilation.\n\nThe practical acceptance of the values of another path. Jupiter exalted. Expansion and contribution through assimilation. There is no way for the individual to survive and allow its gifts to penetrate into the\n\nPage 4\n\nworld without this gift of being able to assimilate, without this gift of being able to find some way socially to integrate oneself into the community.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. Motive -driven assimilation from an inferior position, i.e., for protection or nourishment. These are people that really trade off their knowing. This is the individual that will sell out\ntheir knowing because they recognize that the assimilation is so important. Remember that everybody is projecting onto the 23.5 that they know. Because of that, the outside also wants them to bring that\nknowing out, even if they can't explain themselves. The moment that they can't explain themselves, all that falls apart.\n\nSo, here in the white book, the Jupiter side is: The gift of communicating individual insight to the collective. Here is the gift of reaching out to the collective through assimilation. On the other side, we\nhave: Motive driven assimilation for acceptance and protection from the collective. \"I will be nice to them. I am not going to tell them what I know. I want them to like me. I don't want them to throw me out.\nA couple of years from now, maybe, when they really do accept me I'll tell them what I know.\"\n\nThis is what usually happens with the fifth line and again, the nature of how somebody can express their individuality is almost exclusively conditioned by their culture, by their family environment when they\nwere young, usually within the first seven years. The impact of how you are conditioned by the outside world when you are an individual child has enormous impact for the rest of your life, whether or not you\nare going to have the courage to be able to express your \"I know\", or whether you spend all of your time being concerned about being accepted by the society around you.\n\nThe vast majority of individuality on this planet is more concerned about being accepted and not being rejected by the totality' than they are aboutestablishingi their knowing in the world. As you can see from\nthis projected pressure from the outside, theigreatest'presswre on the individual is to assimilate. Once you have established the value of your knowing,, after that, you have to be like everybody else.\n\n23.6 Fusion\n\nWhen you come to the sixth line, to the end of the process, you come to this place of transition.. As we.\nhave seen already, it is rare fop the sixth line to be actively involved in the process of the hexagram because it is so interested) in what is going on in the whole circuit. When you are dealing with the\ncircuitry of Individuality,, yow are dealing with an emormously complex circuitry. The! moment-you are looking owl towards all of that circuitry, what you are really looking owl towards is: Is any knowing of\nvalue if: it does not lead) to m iutatiomt This is the! nature of the sixth line here.. In order for knowing to lead to mutation, this is; a process that comes out of bringing the diversity into synthesis, as a fusion.\n\nThis line is. called Fusion. It says: The! gradual attunement of diversity through synthesis. The! first thing to recognize is that these are indiMidualb that will take the longest time to express their \"I know.\" Built\ninto them is a genetic recognition that each knowing is a block that eventually )builds a structure a this is the channel of Structuring) in which the! knowing is so clear that the! mutation is then possible.\n\nMars exalted. The exponential growth of energy and its power of assertion engendered by fusion. In the white book: Individual knowing which brings diversity through synthesis. But that takes time. These are\nnot the kind of knowers that jump up and say, \"I know, I know.\" There is this sense of knowing in them, but there is also this sense that the knowing is not complete. Knowing is about knowing who you are and\nwhy you are. That is the core of knowing. For the individual, that is the essence for them. That is a complex process because you have to live long enough to be able to get some kind of an impression of\nwhat it is to be in this world, in your own life.\n\nPage 5\n\nJupiter in detriment. The principled but futile withdrawal from fusion that leads to atrophy. This is the sixth line saying, \"I know a lot of things but I don't know what I really need to know and I have had\nenough. It is not possible. How can I find that knowing that will lead to mutation? I have been going through all of these knowings and I don't know how all of that can fit together.\"\n\nIndividual knowing that holds on to diversity and loses its power in expression. The sixth line can only express a knowing that is mutative. Otherwise, it is not really going to bother. Of course, as a child, it will\ngo through the \"I know, I know\" process, like all children that are individual in terms of the mental or throat process, but the reality is that, as they mature in life, they are going to hold back more and more\nand more until they have that opportunity to see the synthetic knowing. If not, they'll wait. We have been looking at how sixth lines move to the next hexagram. We saw how the abstract shifts over to the logic\nand how the logic jumps back over to the abstract, and here, in this individual process, we have this remarkable movement. VWte have this movement that goes from the 23.6 to the 8.1.\n\nThe 8.1 is the very next hexagram and it is the mirror to the 23 because it is out of the 8 that its potential contribution can be made to society, not at a mental level, but in terms of identity and direction.\n\nPage 6",

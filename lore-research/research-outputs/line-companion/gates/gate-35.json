      "heading": "Humility",
      "raw": "The first line, the foundation, is saying Humility. The ability to accept rejection. This is the core of the change process, of the feeling process: the ability to accept rejection.\n\nIn this acceptance of rejection, you have Venus exalted. The artist that accepts rejection as part of the process. You have the word 'artist' here. At the foundation of the experiential way of life is a deep\nrecognition that the experiential path is an artistic path. In other words, to live is also an art. How you live is an art. How you experience and how you move through experience, is an art. This is a collective\nprocess and, as such, it goes up and down on the emotional wave and so there always will be this dilemma.\n\nThe Neptunian side is: A self destructive reaction to rejection. Loss of worth. In the white book:\nAcceptance of change and rejection as part of the process. This is an ongoing process. Change comes and you have to go through a process where the crisis is initiated and, in that crisis, you have to let go of what\nyou were doing and go on to the next thing. There are those that are rejected. There is yourself who can be rejected because you can bring out that very stimulus in other people.\n\nOn the other side, you have Change and rejection as humiliation. In the artistic sense of the word, what this is really saying is that, like the 16.6, what it is looking for is how is the logic going to feel in life\nitself? \"I want to be able to feel it. It is not enough just to know what the mathematics of the skill is. I\n\nPage 1\n\nwant to be able to feel it. I want art and life to be one.\" Art and life to be one is a deep drive in these people. Of course, there is no way in which the abstract creative person can develop unless they go\nthrough all kinds of change and crisis. Otherwise, they will never have enough experience collected in their process, which means that they have to accept rejection and change until finally what they feel and\nhow they feel carries with it creative power."

      "heading": "Creative block",
      "raw": "When we come to the second line, we come to projection. We saw with the 16.2 that what is projected outwards is this Cynicism. When you come over here to the abstract process, what it projects out is\nboredom. This is the great line of boredom. You have to recognize about the nature of this gate, what it represents, is that 'progress cannot exist in a vacuum'. So, the vacuum is always there and that means that\nchange and that movement through the experiential way is dependent on getting access to the solar plex wave. There is always this sense of vacuum the moment that the wave is not there because there is no\npossibility to be able to manifest.\n\nThis line of boredom is called Creative block. Lack of inspiration which stops progress. Venus exalted.\nAttunement with the vagaries of the muse and the recognition that creativity is energy that ebbs and flows. The Moon in detriment. The need to take action, however mundane, to overcome the feeling of\nemptiness. The actions being uninspired do not further progress. These are people that get bored. They do not accept that they have to wait for the energy to come to them. They won't know that until they are in\nthe resonance to the fifth line, which always knows because it gets projected on. It is the paper tiger. In not being able to accept that they have to wait is this sense of boredom, of being locked away from having\nany progression. And on the other side, because of the boredom, the moment that any kind of energy is available, they jump to fill up the empty space and it does not make them feel good. These people get into\na lot of unfortunate collective problems because they jump simply because they have been waiting to jump. The moment they get the energy, they go.\n\nCreativity and the muse will always come and go. It is easy to say that to 35.2's. It does not mean that they are going to accept it, like all information.\n\nThe other side of that is: The need for change and the fear of stasis. This gate is all about change, after all.\nThere is this deep need for change and there is this fear that, if the energy is not there, they can't do anything and that life is horrible. These people can really suffer from this creative block and, because of\nthat, they can get into a lot of trouble."

      "raw": "If you want to have a wild and incredible crisis, lots of chaos, enormous turmoil and jump around all over the place psychically, than hang out with a 35.3 because that is what you will get. Because it is the end of\nthe lower trigram process, it is not yet transpersonal and yet, it is a gate of adaptation. What is built into this is Collaboration. This is the blind openness to the emotional wave.\n\nThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Very beautiful, very nice, this is a wonderful line. Jupiter exalted. Benefic encouragement of others that expands personal as well as communal progress. That\nsounds very nice. It is true. They will give anybody with a defined emotion access to their Throat. It does not matter, what it is. They will eventually learn, of course. When they get older, if they survive, they'll\nknow not to do that so much. But nonetheless, this is something that they can only learn from experience through trial and error. So they go through a lot of messy stuff when they are young.\n\nPage 2\n\nOn the other side of this, Sun in detriment. The need to be the center that ignores the importance of others. \"I have to have the experience. I need to have this crisis. I need to check this out. I don't care what\nyour problem is in it. I have to go through this process.\" This line is fixed on the change process. One of the things to recognize for these people, for anybody that has the feeling stream that goes from the 41 to\nthe 35, is that change is natural. Without change, they can't be healthy. Without crisis, they can't move on to the next thing. Their crisis is always a question of inexperience. It is all about getting experience. This\nthird line runs into all kinds of experiences.\n\nThe ability to bring progressive change into others' lives. By the way, they do because they bring wild crises. Because they bring the depth of crisis, whoever gets that crisis really does learn something and\nthere is a progress. That is not about bad or good. They can be very exciting people to be around. I don't know if you want them in your bedroom every night but they are very exciting people.\n\nOn the other side we have: The need to be the center for progress. They are the ones that are manifesting out of the throat. They are the ones that need to be the center of that process, but all of this is simply about\nthem blindly being open to the change and feeling process. To manifest this energy makes them feel good. They make a lot of mistakes along their way."

      "heading": "Hunger",
      "raw": "The third and the fourth lines have a lot of similarities but there is a major difference between them: the third line is always open to the solar plex center and always open to the experience but, of course, because\nit does not really understand the other side, it makes a lot of mistakes since it is not always connected to the right kind of energy to fulfill that experience properly. When you get to the fourth line,\nexternalization, you get to the capacity to recognize what is on the other side. It is a transpersonal line. It is called Hunger.\n\nThe whole fixing and direction of this energy is: The insatiable appetite for progress. These people constantly need change. Not only that, but they constantly generate the change mechanism because they\nknow exactly who carries the emotional energy on the other side. These people can be deep manipulators of others in the sense that they recognize who are the emotional people and who they can take that energy\nfrom and bring it through so that they can get the experience they need.\n\nMoon exalted. Less severe. Symbolized by the phases of the Moon, the drive may be obsessive when the\nMoon is full, but like the fading of the Moon, the obsession abates. The Moon describes the emotional wave. What this is really saying is: it takes a lifetime. There is no short route. Mastery in the logic sense\ntakes a lifetime to reward. Mastery in the abstract sense, experiential mastery, takes a lifetime of experiences before there is a depth to that experience so that you can share the value of it with others.\nThey are people that control the change mechanism and, because of that, they can take advantage of emotional people because they can use their energy to manifest the crisis and change that they need.\nBecause of that, they can be very unfair to those people. Remember that the collective process is not personal. A lot of people get hurt here. This is a channel that is deeply sexual. A lot of people get hurt\nhere because somebody wants to make love to a redhead and the redhead thinks it is because they love them, but it is simply an experience. It is just collective and it does not really matter. The person that is\nsitting there with the 35 is just orchestrating that \"I feel like\" and can take advantage of that person that has the energy and then be very cold to them afterwards because the collective experience is over.\n\nIn the white book: Change for change's sake. The drive lessens with age; or The drive for progress that will ultimately step on toes and lead to recriminations. These people will ultimately run into crisis\nthemselves because they will have people in their lives who will often feel abused by them. Of course, in\n\nPage 3\n\nthose kinds of situations, they will get the emotional crisis and, depending on where the wave is, how bright and burning that crisis will be."

      "heading": "Altruism",
      "raw": "The fifth line always tells you how the world projects onto the gate. The world projects onto this gate as a gate of experience. The 36th gate is the gate of inexperience and the 35 is the gate of experience. So,\neverybody who is looking at the 35th gate and projecting onto it says, \"They have the experience. Maybe they will share that experience with me, so I can also get it.\" So it is the 35.5 that is getting this projected\nonto them all the time. They are the ones that have the experience: we project that onto them and then they come and hook into it.\n\nIt is called Altruism. The sacr!Rce of personal for communal progress. These are people that have all the pressure coming from the outside to bring this outlet of experience to them. Again, like all fifth lines,\nwhen they are young, all this pressure is being put on them to be the outlet while they themselves do not necessarily know the depth yet of what they are themselves.\n\nMercury exalted. The principles of interaction and harmony communicated successfully for the benefit of the whole. This is their role in life, to open up the way for experience to others. By the way, because it is\na fifth line and because it is all projected on them, they can be quite hesitant later in life to provide that.\nYou can get a taste of that hesitancy in the detriment underneath, which says: Though altruistic and cooperative in general, a personal regret that in interaction a greater personal expansion has been lost.\nThis is very much like the 16.5. \"Yes, I can do this for all the others but I am only giving them the experience I already have. What about the new experiences that I need?\"\n\nOne of the things that are very boring for this fifth line (remember that the second line, the resonance below, is the line of boredom) is that they have all these people that keep on coming to them for that one\nexperience they have had, locking them into repeating that very experience for the others when they themselves are looking for a new kind of experience. This can be very frustrating for them. The 35th gate\nis always under enormous pressure because it is under the pressure of the solar plex system. So often, for example, people with the fifth line are being projected on when they are young and they may not have the\nexperience in whatever that thing is at all. Because it is being projected on them and because they are connected to the wave, they take on that role of guiding the experience. They can have quite a crisis in all\nthat. That is part of the process of these gates pointed at the solar plex. They are always open to this unpredictable and very powerful motor."

It is the only pure\npossessive gate that manifests. It is a voice that says, \"I have,\" or \"I don't have,\" and the 35.6, when it gets to the end of that process, says, \"What is the point of just another experience? What do I have from that\nexperience?\" So, here we find an aspect in which the only thing that is important is, \"Is that experience going to have a corrective value in it, that by doing this experience, or going through it, I really do get\nsomething other than the experience itself?\"\n\nThe 35 is a gate of expectation and the 16 is a gate of identification.

The process of crystallization coupled with ambition that assures timely and effective correction. In the white book: Progressive change that results from\ncorrection. They will only get into that change if they see that this is a corrective process. I know so many abstract people for whom, after going through all their crises, the only new experience that they were\ninterested in is a guru or a therapist so that they can go through a new experience that could be corrective for them. By the way, that is not saying that it was, but nonetheless, it is the kind of thing that the 35.6 is\nlooking for. \"I want an experience that is of value to me, so that, at the end of that experience, I have really learned something that is going to add to the quality of my life.\"\n\nMars in detriment. A destructive tendency that in its personal application may be the necessary severity to ensure correction, but when applied generally will meet with resistance and tend to reinforce rather than\nrectify situations. \"No, I am not just going to do that with you. Sorry, I am not interested in doing that because I want to do something that will give me something at the end, rather than just having a good\ntime. \" It is not about whether it will feel okay to do the experience. What is it going to deliver?\n\nCorrection which brings change through severity and even destruction, and will always meet resistance.\nThese people can be very heavy because what they are saying is, \"Yeah, but if we will work with this energy, we will do something that is deep. We will do something important, something that is really\ngoing to change us. We will do something that will really bring a reward.\" This is a very difficult thing.\nOne of the things to recognize about this sixth line is that they need to know what they have and what they don't have. Otherwise, they will have no peace. An example for the heaviness of this kind of\nemotional correction is in therapy, when you have somebody that is screaming in your face in order to get you into a different state.\n\nPage 5"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 35 PROGRESS\n\nThe 35th gate is the gate of life. Out of that gate we have the human experiential way. Rather than having a gate that is opened up to a non-motor splenic system (the 16), we have a gate that opens up to the solar\nplex system and its incredible wave and power.\n\nThe 35th gate is not interested in finding out where the energy is. The energy is always going to be there at one level or another. They are always going to meet it whether it is defined or not because that energy\nis only one step away. The 35th gate is a primary gate of action. Due to that, there is very little restriction on it.\n\nThe 16 and the 35 and their respective channels, are about talent. Logical talent is about repetition and the development of mastery. Abstract talent comes through experience. You play 25 different instruments in\nyour life because you can never stay with any of them because your life is full of change and instability.\nBut at the end of your career, somebody comes to you and says: \"What kind of musical instrument do you think I should play?\" The experiential person has a background, has a talent from experience, to be able to\ngive advice.\n\nThe 35th gate is also a gate that is deeply creative, but it is not creative in the sense of repetition and not in the sense of being collective in the need for energy. It is creative in its experiential possibilities.\n\nAbove the lines, it says: By design, progress cannot exist in a vacuum and is dependant on interaction. All change is dependent on getting access to the solar plex energy, but progress is the nature of this gate. In\nother words, this is the great changing gate. It does not say, \"I experiment,\" it says, \"I feel,\" and usually, \"I feel like a change.\" This 'usually' is the conditioning factor. If they do not repeat, they stay healthy.\nThey go through the'experience, but'diily once. You make love in a canoe. You don't have to do that twice. You do it once, you get the experience and you always know what it is like to make love in a\ncanoe. Don't do it a second time because you may drown. If you survive the first time, hold on to the experience; put it away in your memory and go on to another kind of experience.\n\n35.1 Humility\n\nThe first line, the foundation, is saying Humility. The ability to accept rejection. This is the core of the change process, of the feeling process: the ability to accept rejection.\n\nIn this acceptance of rejection, you have Venus exalted.

This is a collective\nprocess and, as such, it goes up and down on the emotional wave and so there always will be this dilemma.\n\nThe Neptunian side is: A self destructive reaction to rejection.

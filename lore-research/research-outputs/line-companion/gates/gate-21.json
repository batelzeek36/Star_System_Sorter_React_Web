  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 21 BITING THROUGH\n\nWe come to a gate that has enormous significance in our lives. It is a gate that often creates a lot of problems because it is the only gate that is designed to be a controlling gate. It can only be a controlling\ngate because it has the most powerful ego.\n\nThe fact that it is a controlling gate, the fact that it is a powerful ego is legitimate. In other words, this controlling force is necessary in order to be able to serve and protect the tribe. The 21 is here to serve the\ncommunity. It is here to establish for the community what is viable and what works. It is here to make sure that the community has what it needs: the food and shelter that it needs and the work that it needs.\n\nIt is here to make sure that there is reward for those efforts, that society not only works but has time for leisure. In other words, it is there to look after the needs of humanity living together on the material plane.\nIt is the channel of Materialism. Because the 21 is a control gate, it is also very difficult for people and often extremely difficult for the 21's themselves.\n\nAbove the lines it says: The justified and necessary use of power in overcoming deliberate and persistent interference. 'The justified and necessary use of power...' These are very strong words. You will not hear\nthat kind of language in any other gate, '...in overcoming deliberate and persistent interference.' In other words, it is not there to overcome unintentional interference. It is not there to overcome interference that\nis not non-persistent.\n\nBut it is there to be in control. It is justified in the use of its power. This is the ego that must strike out.\nThat is why it is an ego that is very uncomfortable for those who have it and those who have to experience it.\n\nThe way in which a 21 operates has to do with the nature of their design. An undefined heart center with the 21 is very different from a defined one. A 21 with a defined heart center is very different as a\ngenerator, a manifestor or a projector. In other words, there are a lot of complexities in how the gate actually can operate.\n\nIf you have the 21 and you are a projector, people in your life have to recognize that you have to be in control. Otherwise, you are not meeting the right people. If you are a generator with the 21, you can only\ntake control when somebody asks you and you respond to it. If you are a 21 that is a manifestor, you have to ask their permission before you control them. If you are a 21 in an undefined heart center, all you can\ndo is wait to be offered control because the moment that you claim control, you will break your heart.\n\nThis is where the heart sits. Everybody who has the 21 who is not allowed to exercise their power to be in control, those people in their lives who do not allow that are killing them, literally. This is a deeply\nmisunderstood hexagram. The 21 has a right to be in control. It has a justified and proper right to be in control, but depending on the design, the control will be allowed and will come out in different ways. The\nmoment it is there, the 21 has to be trusted and allowed to do its job of serving the community. This is an ego that truly will serve the community as long as it is recognized in its power.\n\nNOTE: The 21 st gate has four different lines that are only singularities now because of the phenomenon that Neptune and Pluto are not active in our lifetimes. (Please see the section on Outer Planet Transits in\nthe Glossary in Volume 2 copied below.)\n\nPage 1\n\nOUTER PLANET TRANSITS\n\nDetriments and Exaltations Affected by Pluto and Neptune\n\nTwo outer planets, Neptune and Pluto, have cycles that greatly exceed the span of a single human life.\nNeptune's cycle around the wheel requires approximately 165 years and Pluto's cycle is about 284 years.\nConsequently, depending upon the position of these planets in their transit around the wheel, periodically, the exalted or the detriment of certain lines that are fixed by these planets may be inactive,\ni.e. not present in the world in the human population. This means that, at any given time, these particular aspects of design may or may not be present, genetically in the world and therefore, these qualities are\nnot accessible to human beings until the planet re-activates that gate or its harmonic.\n\nSomething to keep in mind, also, is that the period of time that these detriments or exaltations remain inactive after there are no people alive carrying these activations will be shortened somewhat by Pluto or\nNeptune's transit to the harmonic gate within the channel. How much shorter is determined by the relative positions of the harmonic gates within the wheel.\n\nFor example, gates 25 and 51 that form the channel of Initiation are both positioned in Aries. Pluto has not been in Aries, and therefore in either gate 25 or gate 51, since the beginning of the 19th century.\nThus, there has been no activation of the 25.3 in detriment, the 51.1 exalted or the 51.6 in detriment for a very long time, and it will still be a number of years before Pluto re-enters Aries. With Neptune's absence\nfrom the 25. 1 and Pluto from the 5 neither of the exaltations is active, which means that the whole foundation for Initiation during this time has operated through the detriments.\n\nAt the time of this publication, Neptune is transiting Aquarius, having recently moved through the 41st gate, activating the Al. 1, Reasonableness, in the exaltation and bringing that genetic material back out\ninto the world. Pluto is moving through Sagittarius, finishing its transit through the 5th gate and thereby re-activating the qualities of the detriments of Inner Peace and Joy (the 5.2 and the 5.5) within our gene\npool. These qualities that have been absent genetically for so many years are now being carried by those children born under these transits.\n\nThe following is a list of lines currently affected by Pluto or Neptune in which these lines have an aspect that is not functioning as of now. When doing readings for clients, when you get to these lines, you can\nonly read the one aspect of the line, the exaltation or the detriment, that is still operating.\n\n3.3 Pluto in detriment.\n\n3.6 Pluto in detriment.\n\n21.2 Neptune in detriment. 21.3 Neptune exalted. 21.5 Pluto in detriment. 21.6 Pluto exalted. 22.4\nNeptune exalted.\n\n24.6 Pluto in detriment. (Pluto goes into 61 in 2010.)\n\n25.1 Neptune exalted.\n\n25.3 Pluto in detriment. 30.4 Pluto exalted. 30.5 Pluto exalted 30.3 Pluto exalted. 36.2 Neptune exalted. 36.3 Pluto exalted. 36.4 Pluto exalted.\n\n36.5 Pluto exalted.\n\n41.6 Pluto in detriment.\n\n49.2 Pluto in detriment. 49.3 Neptune exalted. 49.6 Neptune exalted.\n51.1 Pluto exalted.\n\n51.6 Pluto in detriment.\n\n61.6 Pluto exalted. (Pluto will get there in the next 8 years.)\n\nPage 2\n\n21.1 Warning\n\nAll first lines speak for the nature of the hexagram. Warning is the basis of the 21 and its control. \"Don't interferel Attention.\" The use of force as a last resort. In other words, in the use of power to be in control,\nthe worst thing is to start with force first. I learned this many years ago as a teacher. In public teaching institutions, there were always those teachers who can never, ever control their students. They will\nthreaten them. When that does not work, they will use force and the moment you use force, you cannot go any further. The moment that I had a teacher that would strap and punish me, I knew that I had taken\nthem to their limitation. What else could they do? Kill me?\n\nWarning. The use of force as a last resort. It does not say that you don't use force. If you keep on saying, \"Hey, look, this is what you have to do,\" and they still do not listen, then you can use force.\n\nMars exalted. The fierceness to be respected without recourse to action. This is an overview line. It takes a long time to get that respect. It is not that you have it right away. This is a deeply painful gate to have if\nyou are a child. You are here to be in control but you are being dictated by your parents, your school, by your siblings, by friends. What usually happens is that these people live with nothing but tension. The\ncross of Tension is rooted in the polarity between the 21 and the 48. The 21st gate can bring an enormous tension which becomes a strain on the heart, simply because these people are not allowed to be in control.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. An inherent peacefulness that all too often turns a necessary warning into a plea.\nIn the white book: The willpower and ego to ensure respect; or A lack of willpower that is forced to ask for respect. These are the 21 's who say, \"Look, please let me be in control. I know what I am doing.\nPlease stop interfering. Please.\" That is not a very powerful way of dealing with things. In that moment, the 21 is asking for the other not to interfere when, in fact, they are here to insist that there is no\ninterference.\n\nThis is the great dilemma of the 21. That dilemma is written in the genetic continuity of the chart. The 21 in an undefined heart center is dependent on the other person as to whether they can bring out their\ncontrol or not and they may have to ask. When it is defined to the throat, it is a different process but always, the dilemma for the 21 is to find a way to get the respect so that they are not interfered with. They\ncannot get that until they learn how to control things. If you have a child with the 21, give them responsibilities. Give them things that they control (their schedule or whatever) so they learn what it is to\nbe in control and they get respect for their ability to be in control of things.\n\n21.2 Might is right\n\nThe second line is called Might is right and it has Neptune in detriment, which means that this side is not operating in our time.\n\nIt is an overview line: The legitimacy of action in response to flagrant and persistent interference.\nRemember, to be in control means that you don't deal with any kind of interference because it will show that you are not really in control. This is the ego, after all. You release that control when you are\nconstantly being interfered with; that is the moment that you have to stop the interference.\n\nThink about the second line, which does not know any of that. It does not even realize that it is being in control. Because it does not have that realization (lower trigram, not transpersonal), it is simply in its own\nthing and then somebody comes along and, because they can look in the window, they say, \"These people are being in control of that. I will interfere with that.\" Boy, do they get a surprise!\n\nPage 3\n\nWhat comes out immediately is Mars exalted; there is no detriment. Powerful and extreme reaction. Here, the severest action will be the most successful. You see somebody sitting at a desk and they are doing\nsomething. They are in control of what they are doing and somebody comes up to them and says, \"You really shouldn't.\" The legitimate rejection of interference on the material plane. This can be very shocking\nto people.\n\n21.3 Powerlessness\n\nThe third line is a line that is often totally misunderstood and misinterpreted. Whenever I meet 21.3's, I do the best I can to correct them immediately about the nature of what this line is. Because of the keynote,\nPowerlessness, there is a false assumption connected to this. This is not about being without power. This is about the possibility of being powerless.\n\nAn overview line, trial and error: Where the just are condemned to a futile confrontation with superior forces. This is the way logic works: if you break down what this sentence is actually saying, it says that\nthe just are condemned to a futile confrontation with superior forces, not with inferior forces. When somebody has the 21.3, they can never ever work for somebody else. It is hard for 21's to work for\nanybody else anyway and I always tell 21's the same thing: you have to be your own boss and if that means that you have to work in a corporation, then you have a separate contract which states that you are\nan outsider that is contracted in so you can be in control of your material life and not be dependent.\n\nWhat happens to these people in their trial and error process is that, for example, they try to get into a corporation and they get in at a lower level. These 21.3's go through hell with that because every step and\nlayer above them, every layer of management and control that is above them, is absolutely infuriating to them because they can't win. They don't have the juice. They can't win. They are powerless. The moment\nthat you give a 21.3 a boss, they are powerless. This leads to a lot of difficulties.\n\nThere is an advantage to that. The Neptunian field is not at work. The advantage is because this exalted is\nDefeat as a survivable humiliation, often acceptable through the abuse of drugs and alcohol. This is not active, what is active is: Total withdrawal. Think about what that means in our society.\n\nIn the white book you can see that it is: A lack of will for the material path in order to protect the ego.\nThese are people that do not want to work, do not want to leave school. These are people that do not want to have a boss, that want to reject the whole material plane because, in their life, it is impossible to have\nsomebody controlling them and telling them what to do. So, when you meet a 21.3 and you are dealing with this energy, you must tell them that there is only one thing that can help them: never, ever have a\nboss.\n\nAgain, the dilemma of being an ego-child: ego children, like emotional children, have enormous problems in their early years because they have to deal with authority. Particularly, 21 children constantly have to\ndeal with authority. A 21.3 child can be made to feel like they have no power at all and that futility can be a deep pain in their life and they will just withdraw. They will just hide so that they do not have to listen\nto somebody controlling them.\n\nIt is very important to recognize that 21 children have to be treated with respect. They have to. They have to be given their opportunity to show that they are capable of being in control even when they are very\nyoung, however you work that out because, otherwise, this powerlessness is conditioning them from the very start and they never get to flower at all.\n\nSo many 21.3's that I meet are so angry at the world, so uncomfortable with having been directed all of their lives. For them it is so easy: do not have a boss. Do not have a boss in your relationships; do not\n\nPage 4\n\nhave a boss at work. Do not have a superior force in your life, unless you are a masochist and you love to be powerless. By the way, the punks came with this genetic theme.\n\nRegarding their approach to the material plane: this line does not mean that the 21.3 has to withdraw.\nRemember the overview of the line which says that the futile confrontation is only with superior forces.\nThere is no need to withdraw if they are not dealing with superior forces. The moment they go out and try to deal with superior forces, automatically, all 21.3's will withdraw. They will have a very hard time on\nthe material plane.\n\nThe advantage we can give them in letting them know what that line means for them is to understand that if they give up trying to work for somebody (again that takes ego courage), then that withdrawal is not\nactive for them. It will only be active if they meet a superior force because then they will be in a futile position.\n\n21.4 Strategy\n\nWhen you come to the upper trigram, particularly in the 21st gate, you are dealing with something very different: the capacity to bring control to the transpersonal experience. The fourth and fifth lines are\nextremely well equipped in the 21 to be able to control what they have to control, which is manifestation.\nEverything about the tribe is desperate to get to the throat. For the tribe, there is only one way: the 21/45.\nThe throat itself is dependent on having that ego do the work, do the serving. The only way the throat gets that is by protecting the 21.21's seek out their protectors because they need to find access to\nmanifestation, and that is their gift. Their gift is that they have the ability to transpersonally see how to get things manifested. 21.4's and 21.5's make very powerful leaders, good presidents of companies. The\nfourth line is called Strategy.\n\nOverview line: Careful appraisal of opposing forces to establish a proper response. This is not simply recognizing that one has the capacity to be in control and the ego that says, \"I have to be in control.\" This\nis an ego that says, \"Wait a second. How do I exercise my control?\" In other words, this is an aspect that works the strategy for getting to manifestation. You have to control some people tightly if you are a 21.\nSome others have to be given space. It varies. The question of what kind of control to use, who to control and when to control, becomes a transpersonal strategy.\n\nWe have Jupiter exalted. Success in action through clarity, which means control as the result of investigation: looking at things and seeing how they can be done. But remember, this is a one-tracked\nprocess, so strategy is everything. These are very strategic people and they are often accused of being deeply manipulative because they know how to control. Because they are in control-positions, people\nrarely accuse them of that because they tend to be dependent on their manipulation to have what they need in this life.\n\nEarth in detriment. A tendency, when in the right, to misjudge the power of one's opponents. This is always a dilemma for the ego: just because it is right does not mean that it is going to work. Here in the\nfourth line, just because you have the right strategy does not mean that it is going to work. There are a lot of businesses everywhere in the world that design strategies every year of how they will make millions.\nYes, strategies are nice, but they do not always work.\n\nIn the white book: The ego to succeed on the material plane and the instinct to use willpower effectively in response to conditions. This is the gift of being able to see where you use your control. The Earth\ndetriment. The drive when in the right to follow one's ego rather than one's instincts. This is the ego saying, \"This is my strategy. I made it up and I will not give it up. It will work,\" even though you know\nthat it will crash.\n\nPage 5\n\nThe 'opposing forces' are forces which interfere. In this line, it does not matter whether they are inferior or superior. Only the third line is particularly about superior forces. The third line is the pathway that leads\nto wisdom. For any 2 1, the third line is really saying: look, if you really understand that you do not have to be powerless, you become the superior force. That is where the real wisdom of the 21 lies, when it\nrecognizes that it is the superior force. The moment a 21 recognizes this, it does not have to claim it anymore. It will get the natural respect that is due because it does recognize that it is the superior force.\n\n21.5 Objectivity\n\nThis is a classic fifth line and even more so because of the impact of not having Pluto being active, so there is no detriment in this particular line in our time. All fifth lines get projected on. They get projected\non because that projection is the desire, the need of passion of the totality to have that kind of a role displayed out of that hexagram. So, society as a whole is looking to the 21.5 and saying, \"They should be\nin control.\" It is projected on them positively and negatively that they should be in control. Obviously, like any fifth line, they can take that opportunity. If someone projects on you that you are in control, if\nyou take control and the result is positive, then control is given to you and you get the respect that is due.\n\nHere we have an overview line. The use of force must be based on impartiality and not emotionally motivated. When you read a line that says it must be impartial and not based on emotions, you know that,\nin the learning process, it is very much partial and very much emotional until it finally learns how to use power properly. Remember, it is an ongoing process.\n\nI have a very powerful ego and it is the only motor in my design, so I manifest out of the power of the ego. The one thing that I know about the ego is its inherent immaturity. The ego takes a very long time to\ngrow up because the rest of what it meets in the world is trying to reduce its power rather than to nurture it.\n\nThe whole thing about the nature of this fifth line is that objectivity is what the totality wants from its controllers. They want its controllers to be impartial. They don't want them to be motivated by\nrelationships or because they owe somebody something. They want to make sure that it is not emotional.\nJust because somebody does not like you for what you did does not mean that they will throw you out when, in fact, you may be of value and may be doing your work. We want our controlling agents to be\nimpartial and non-emotional.\n\nAs a learning curve, the fifth line will be both partially prejudiced and emotional and it learns by the price it pays. The moment that it is not objective in its control, it will create all kinds of resistance from other\nforces. \"I will not let you control me because you do not control fairly. You don't control Johnny as much as you control me.\" They lose the respect that way and, in order for them to gain that back, it iss an\nobjective process that has to be at work.\n\nHere you have Jupiter exalted. A principled and legal character that ensures objectivity. Those principles have to come by. One has to learn how to use power. Because power does not belong to us, it is\nsomething you have to learn to work with, to learn how to use.\n\nIn the white book: The balanced ego... (But it will start off imbalanced, please understand that.l ...whose willpower is applied objectively. We very much need these people in the world and, because this is a time\nthat we do not have Pluto (here, we have a whole generation, day by day, year by year for many years now, that is coming into the world with the possibility of being purely objective, as our controlling\nagents. *The whole world is controlled by 21's. That is part olf the global vibrdtion.'llhat is part of the role of the 21. Let's do our best-to nurture the 211.5s. If you project onto the 21.5 child that It has to be in\n\nPage 6\n\ncontrol, make sure that you teach that dhild the in' portance -of being impartial and nonersotional in its control, in its use of power, because ultimately, these are the beings that are going to apply those controls\nto the rest of the world.\n\nWhen you think about it, all the 110th gates together condition our behavior iim'the'world. All the 2nd gates together condition our direction in the world. All the 21st gates condition whether or not our\nsocieties-and cultures are going to operate properly. It is essential for us that we learn to recognize these qualities in our children and to see very dearly that 21 children must be nurtured so that they end up being\nproductive controlling agents rather than embittered ones, rather than being forced to withdraw, their egos shattered, feeling inferior and not wanting to be involved in controlling. If all the 21's give up being in\ncontrol, we are going to have what the sixth line predicts: nothing but chaos.\n\n21.6 Chaos\n\nThe thing to recognize about the nature of the materialism that is inherent in the 21 is that, built into the most materialistic channel is also anti-materialism, which we already met in the third line: the\npowerlessness that becomes a lack of will for the material plane because of the ego. That manifests differently. For example, people saying that money is bad, that everybody should share. A good hippie\nconsciousness can come out of the 21.3. The same thing is true for the sixth line. Because sixth lines, in and of themselves, are transitional, they are going to sit above in their aloofness and look out on things. A\n21.6 is not very likely to be material and, when they are young, they get involved with it and they discover that it can be disastrous for them.\n\nChaos. Where ineffective action leads to disorder. The moment that you see a line like that and you are dealing with a sixth line, you really know that this line is going to spend most of its life judging whether\nsomething could be an effective action or not. \"Well, I don't know if I should really take control because I don't know if it is really going to work and I don't know if I'll really get what I want to get and I don't\nknow whether I will be interfered with and I'll have all these problems.\" They learn that very early because a 21.6 is like a bull in a china shop. They will go in there and, all of a sudden, everything is\nflying and they never go into that shop again after that. \"Why should I go in there? If I do the wrong thing, everything is going to explode.\"\n\nThe other thing about this line is that the Pluto exalted is not there, so you are dealing with only the\nVenus in detriment. Withdrawal and reliance on inner order in a chaotic situation. This is the greatest fence sitter of all the sixth lines. The 21.6 sits there on that fence and it does not want to do anything else\nother than sitting on that fence because it knows that if it steps off that fence, the possibility is that nothing will result of it but chaos.\n\nIn the white book: Where the material direction is chaotic, the ego will withdraw and use its power to find an inner order. But the moment a 21.6 knows what material path is for it and is in control of that material\npath, you have somebody who can be an enormous success. Sixth lines have this inherent capacity to be wise and fulfilled. It is like the 59.6 who will have a lot of quick relationships when it is young and then\ngive up; but if it finds the right relationship, it will display a quality of intimacy that we call soul mate, that can be absolutely beautiful and it will spend day after day with its partner for the rest of its life. In\nother words, there is the potential in the sixth line for quite a transition experience, something that is really beyond the capacity of the hexagram. However, this is not a very good age for that because the 21.6\ngoes to the 51.1.\n\nThe reality is that the 21 and the 51 are next to each other, so that you have these two very expressive gates of the ego system: one going the material way and one going the initiative and potentially mystical\nway. When the 21.6 is sitting at its point on its roof and it is staring out, it stares into the 5 which does not\n\nPage 7\n\nhave the Pluto exalted. It stares into the 5 in which withdrawal is something that is absolutely necessary after a shock. So the reality is that this sixth line, which is rooted in withdrawal, is looking for an inner\norder that is compounded by the fact that it is moving towards withdrawal. In other words, one of the things that happens to a 21.6 in our time is that they want to be 51 's. Instead of the 21.6 ending up\npursuing the material path, they are going to look for the spiritual way and are trying to find wealth in another way. Many of them end up being spiritual business people and end up making their living by\nselling inner order. That is always a possibility for them.\n\nBut it is a very long process for the 21.6 to find their way. It is going to take time in their life before something is really of value to them to be in control of because the thing for them is that it has to be able\nto come out in the action. If it can't, it is not worth doing.\n\nThe actions have to be correct; otherwise there is nothing but chaos. The actions can only be correct if the material path is correct. The 21.6 is not just looking to be in control, it has to be in control of the right\nthing. The fact that it looks inward is actually an advantage because, from its point of view, it is there to control. If they stay long enough and they watch the movie, they might find the material direction that is\ncorrect for them. When chaos happens, the direction was not correct. The inner order was not right. The actions were ineffective.\n\nPage 8",

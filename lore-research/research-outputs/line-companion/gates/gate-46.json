  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 46 PUSHING UPWARD\n\nKeep something in mind about our work in Human Design. It is a logical system and, as such, it is there to provide a framework in education for people so that they understand the basic mechanics of their\nnature. The nature of love in the world has nothing to do with hugging and kissing, though all that is very nice, but with making sure that people are being educated from the earliest possible age. Without that\neducation, human beings do not have a possibility to see that what they are is not an embarrassment.\n\nWhat they are is not something that has to be refined and improved. It is not something that has to be perfected because it is exactly what it is supposed to be: an aspect of the totality, an aspect of the\nspectrum of things.\n\nWe have a false prophecy about the nature of love. We assume that we generate love in the world by loving each other. This is a funny thing because this has nothing to do with what this love is all about. It\nhas nothing to do with loving your guru, your friend or your dog. It has to do with being one with the creative process, accepting surrender for what it is to be you and seeing in that surrender your own\nbeauty. Only when you find surrender in your own beauty, do you put love in the aura of the world. There is no other way, no matter how sweet and nice you are and how much love you have within yourself, and\nhow much love you want to put out in the world; it is not going to change the aura of our planet. What changes the aura of our planet is human beings living their nature. That is the crux of what our work is, so\nthat human beings can just live out their nature without the morality, without the conditioning, to see clearly what it is just to be themselves. That creates love in the world. We won't see that in our time.\n\nWe have seen that the nature of the love of humanity (the 15th gate) is about the quality of the collective aura, and that is where the love of humanity is going to manifest. When we come to the 46th gate, we\ncome to the body itself and we come to the flesh, and this is the moment that we step into our personal realm. In other words, this is not the generalized aura, but this is the physical body of humanity, which is\nour vehicles. The spiritual nature of the body is the body as a temple, that the flesh, to be in a body, is a holy thing.\n\nAbove the lines it says: Good fortune that may be perceived as the result of serendipity (to be in the right place at the right time) but derives from effort and dedication. To maintain the body, its physical graces,\nits diet, its comfort and its shelter, is an ordeal. We all know that. This requires effort and dedication. To be dedicated to the body is to be dedicated to be in the life. This is the experiential stream of the abstract.\nThis is the very humanist way. In the gates of the Vessel of Love, we have the collective being opposite to the individual. It is part of what the structure of the Vessel is all about. It is deeply personal and\nindividual, in a sense, because the 46/29 as a channel has a quality to it. That quality is to keep the experience the prime focus. In other words, through the 46/29, when you enter into an experience, you\nenter into it and blindly release yourself to it. You literally fall into the experience. In doing so, only when you hit bottom, when the fall comes to an end, when you are through the experience, only then do you\nhave an opportunity to reflect and only then is something gained from that experience.\n\nThe 46 is extremely existential in its nature. What the 46 is all about is being in the experience that brings the good fortune, not necessarily the experience itself. This is what so few understand. If you look for\nsomething to come of your life, nothing will come, but if you are in your life, everything is possible. This is about being in the body and accepting its way.\n\n46.1 Being discovered\n\nThe first line, as the foundation of this, is called Being discovered. Dedication in obscurity that is unexpectedly discovered. This is the whole secret of what this hexagram is all about. Every other place in\n\nPage 1\n\nthe abstract process is loaded with expectation. If I do this and this, I will get that. The 46 says: shut up, just be. Just be in the experience for the sake of the experience and only then it can be productive. Then\nlater, afterwards it can be productive through reflection, through seeing what you have actually been through, because if you stop in the middle, you break the flow, you break the continuity, you lose the\nvalue and you never have a chance to reflect.\n\nNeptune exalted. Art for art's sake. Any creative endeavor that is self-fulfilling sooner or later is recognized. I tell all of these people: just do your thing for the joy of it. Do not worry about whether it\nworks or not, whether it is a success or not, whether you are loved or not. Just be in it because only then is good fortune possible. Then everybody will say that you were in the right place at the right time.\n\nIn the white book: The potential for creative success through dedication. Just to be dedicated to the thing, to be in the experience, to be in your body. Think about it as your body. Just accept what it is to be you.\nTo be lucky (all over the world people play lottery) can only happen if you are being yourself. To be lucky, in the abstract sense, is only when you are living out your nature. Only when you are living out the\nexperience can good fortune come to you. Otherwise, it can't. Don't stop in the middle of the experience and ask yourself: why am I so unlucky?\n\nJupiter in detriment. The ability to judge the potential of those in obscurity but often solely to benefit one's own success. The determination to recognize and benefit from the success of others. This is a deeply\nsocial channel that is rooted in the principle of success. It is 'succeeding where other people fail' or 'failing where other people succeed.' This is all about making the experience of being in the world worthwhile. It\nis the 29 that says yes to life, and it is the 46 that has to accept the life in the body, in the now, for what it is and to wait for its rewards.\n\n46.2 The Prima Donna\n\nWe saw in the 15.2, that the second line was an advantage because it allowed the 15.2 to be seen as an extremist and, therefore, the opportunity of being left alone. When you bring that into the physical body,\nyou come up with The Prima Donna. Everybody looks inside of this person and thinks they see somebody who always thinks that they are in the right place at the right time, doing the right thing. Of course, other\npeople can feel quite uncomfortable with that.\n\nThe Sun exalted. A difficult and demanding nature that succeeds despite its behavior because of the depth of its talents.\n\nThe first two lines are deeply involved with the creative process, obviously. They lay a foundation for the whole hexagram. To accept what it is to be in any experience is inherently a creative process. You will\nlearn from that. Out of reflection can come all sorts of advantages and rewards.\n\nMars in detriment. Unrealistic demands and offensive nature of egocentric mediocrity. Very heavy sounding language. Nicer in the white book: The determination to succeed that may offend others, or The\ndetermination to be treated as a success before it has been realized. These people always think that they are in the right place at the right time and they have this air of what people do not like. Others have the\nsense of, \"How come you feel like being in the right place at the right time and we don't?\" But the 46.2 does not know that. It is a second line. Other people look into them and see that the 46.2's are prima\ndonnas for other people, and not for themselves. They are just in their experience. The 46.2 can be difficult for other people because they are in their experience, but in the end they will accept them. \"They\nare eccentric, or they are terrible people, but they are deeply talented. Look at the way they dance.\"\n\nPage 2\n\nWe are dealing with projection lines in the second and the fifth line, so there is a lot of projection going on. Humanity does not feel lucky. People don't feel lucky about their lives, as a generality. Luck is\nsomething that people hope and look for and dream about. If you see somebody who is really in their trip, these people do get rewards. They may get rewards even though they do not deserve them, which is really\ngalling to other people. The 46.2, if they are in their experience, no matter how uncomfortable they are as a person for other people, tough. They should be in their experience even if it is mediocre. After all, not\nall experiences are great.\n\n46.3 Projection\n\nThird line is adaptive. It is part of the lower trigram. So, the first to the third line have the capacity to be in their experience, but what happens to them when they meet the other side is that it can either\ndestabilize them, or not.\n\nIn this line called Projection, we have the Moon exalted. A practical approach to good fortune that maintains the same patterns and attitudes that brought success and does not get side-tracked by indulging\nin further expectations. In the white book: The determination to stay with what brings success. Think about what happens to these people. They are third line, so they know that they have to be in their\nexperience, and then they meet somebody and that person tries to pull them out of their experience because, the moment they meet them, they say, \"What are you doing? Can we do this? Do you have some\ntime?\" and the third-line person tries to be in their experience, is deeply involved in something and someone taps them on the shoulder and say, \"Excuse me, I have a problem. Can you help me?\"\n\nThe 46.3 has to stay with their thing. This is very practical for them. In other words, they meet the force on the other side but they have to try to get back to being in their experience because that is the only thing\nthat will bring them success. Not what pulls them away. The 46.3 may end up annoying a lot of people who try to break into their experience while they are in there.\n\nMars in detriment. A tendency through projection to treat a potential future as the present, leading to unjustified egoism and the loss of momentum and support. Here comes the ego again. The whole thing\nabout projecting into the future is, the moment that you see that you have an experience, you realize that you need to stay with this experience, and it is not about the rewards you get, but about what you get\ndone, what you get finished. For example, you start the morning and say, \"I'll build this XYZ,\" because that is your pattern, because you want to be able to fulfill that. You want to be in the experience of doing\nthat. You can be the kind of person that says to somebody, \"This thing is going to be ready for you tomorrow.\" Well, this is not existential. The fact is that the third line does not know whether or not they\nwill be left undisturbed because, the moment someone comes into their aura, it breaks that moment of experience. They may not get back to that successful pattern and may end up being somebody who\nsounds like they're always making promises and not keeping them.\n\nIn the white book: The determination to treat a projected success as a reality. By the way, like all of these lines that sound negative, they are not. There are those 46.3's who, out of that experience, learn to find\npeople in their lives that do not disturb them that way, because this is inherently social. They realize that when they meet 29's and they have to make a commitment, it is not the commitment that is important. It is\nthe people that are important because all of this has to do with social context. The fact of the matter is that in the third lines we have the strongest learning process. This is our trial and error process, and it will take\nthem time to live that out.\n\n46.4 Impact\n\nPage 3\n\nWe are dealing with very specialized collective gates which, obviously, by their very nature are social, and we are dealing here with transpersonal lines. As I mentioned before, the 15 and the 46 have very\nunusual lines and here, we come to them in the major transpersonal lines in the fourth and fifth. Normally, the fifth line is exalted and the fourth line has its difficulties. Here you have fourth line that is exalted, and\nit is called Impact.\n\nThe Earth exalted. It is there right from the beginning. The ability, once recognized, ('once recognized' means, though, that there is a process involved) to move rapidly from a position of obscurity to influence.\nThese are people that know how to externalize their experience in the now. They know how to get other people not to get in their way. They are good at that because they are one-tracked. They are fixed on their\nexperience but not to the point of exclusion of the other because they have social gifts. So, they know how to keep to their experience without alienating those people around them and by finding valuable\nallies to help them fulfill their experience.\n\nThe moment that they are recognized, they rapidly move upwards because they have really good skills and they can stay in their experience. The only thing about these people is that their experience is\neverything and, though they have very good social skills and you really think that they are nice, and they may be, the fact is: they do not pay much attention to other people even though they have the social skills\nfor them. They don't. They are in their experience.\n\nYou see that more in the other side of this: Pluto in detriment. A reaction in achievement that tends to bite the hand that fed it. By the way, this is very much the propaganda of those people that have to meet the\n46.4. The fact is that they really are just in their experience. They can forget that you once helped them along that way. It is not that they do not care about you. It is not that if they were really confronted with\nit, they would not realize, \"Oh, yes, I did not realize that I did that to you.\"\n\nThese are often people that have psychic crashes. They end up sitting at a therapist's desk because they suddenly realize that they have crushed a lot of people and they did not even know that was happening.\nPoor things, it is not their fault. Imagine trying to cure somebody of that. It is not their fault. They are there to bite off the hand that feeds them. To those people that do not understand that they happen to be in\ntheir experience and that that is what brings them good fortune: tough.\n\nRemember that the nature of a line is not something that we have to heal. I always get this negative reaction that people have to certain lines, but it is not about fixing these things. It is not being a moralist\nsaying, \"Boo to biting off the hand that feeds you. This is disgusting.\" This is not the way it works. They are simply externalizing their experience at the expense of their social skills. What to do? That is who\nthey are.\n\nIn the white book: The good luck which comes from being determined that eventually, in the right place at the right time, leads to recognition; or The determination in success to ignore those who helped create\nit. By the way: this is not motivedriven ignoring. It is not like, \"I am going to ignore them because they helped me.\" The only time that it can be like that is when they are told by somebody; then they are like\nthat.\n\n46.5 Pacing\n\nWe have an exalted fourth line and a detrimental fifth line. Fifth lines are normally the exalted lines. This is probably, of all the 64 hexagrams, the weakest of all fifth lines because of its social and abstract nature,\nand because we are dealing with pure projection. In terms of the projection: this is what society is looking at. What society wants to see is that there is a pacing and that everything has its kind of process so that\nsuccess can be worked out. Everybody projects on the 46.5 that they are the ones that can always be\n\nPage 4\n\nsuccessful. Remember that the 29.5 is about failure and the detriment in the 29.5 is about guaranteed failure. So here, when you are dealing with the 46.5 you are dealing with the consequences of what\nhappens to projection on this abstract gate. What happens is in its language.\n\nThe Moon exalted. The maintenance of proper rhythm... (Rhythm does not belong here. Rhythm is the\n15th gate.) ...that in its instinctive practicality... (Instinct does not belong here but in the tribal circuitry.) ...avoids radical divergence from successful patterns. (With patterns we go back into the logic again.) The\nabstract process is intended to be existential. It is not intended to stay with things. This is not what it is about. It is an existential process in the experience. The cycle of the experience can be 10 minutes or 25\nyears, but the abstract being is here to go through an experience, to reflect upon it and go on to another experience.\n\nIf you are an abstract person and you are working as a salesperson, if you see a different client all the time, that is healthy. You go through the process, the experience. It is existential and you get to reflect on\nit later. \"That person was nasty. He/she was a bad customer,\" or \"This product sells; the other one doesn't.\" In other words, you get the whole picture from that. The moment that you deal with servicing\nthat customer and you see that customer day after day, it will all fall apart because that is not an abstract process. You can have the experience for a while to see what it is like to service people, but you are not\ngoing to stay with that.\n\nBut here, in the fifth line, it is projected on these people that there should be stability in this. So what happens is that people come along and project onto the 46.5 that they are going to be a success in\nwhatever they are doing, and these people get stuck in that. They get conditioned by the outside to get stuck in a certain experience and what brought them early success ends up failing.\n\nThe 46.5 is walking along the beach and they look down and see some money on the ground. They pick it up and put it in their pocket. They are very pleased and continue their walk. Then they sit in a cafe with a\nfriend who tells the 46.5, \"You are the kind of person. You are always so lucky. You can make a living just walking up and down the beach, picking up money.\" Off they go and they find some money, this day\nand that day. Each time they find something, it gives them a little confidence to stay with it, and they will find more until they quit because this is what happens to them. Their possibility for success in the\nmoment gets recognized by somebody else, projected on them and then they get stuck in that pattern. The maintenance of proper rhythm that in its instinctive practicality avoids radical divergence from successful\npatterns.\n\nNeptune in detriment. An irrational... (That is the knowing circuit.) ...rejection of the very patterns that have proven successful. So, to understand that is to also understand that, to everybody else, it is irrational.\nIt is projected on them. \"How can you stop walking up and down the beach picking up coins? You are so lucky, you will always find something. You are crazy to give that up.\" 46.5's are driven crazy by other\npeople. If you have a 46.5 client, tell them to learn about people and to understand that when people project on them they are a success, they want something of it. They want to share in it. The 46.5 ends up\nwith commitments that are devastating for them. The most devastating commitment for an abstract being is a commitment that says, \"I am going to stay with the pattern.\"\n\nIn the white book: The determination to stay with the rhythm which brings success; or Determined to say no to the very rhythm that brings success. By the way, that saying no to the rhythm (i.e. the \"cycle\") is\nafter being projected into it and then discovering that while you stay in it, it does not work and then you say no to it and you get out of it. Very difficult position.\n\nThe whole thing for the 46 who does not have the whole channel and is looking at the 29: it is who you do the experience with. Everybody thinks that commitment is about the thing. For the abstract person, it is\n\nPage 5\n\nnot the thing but who you do the thing with, because it is collective. So, you cannot avoid going through those experiences where you get into things through other people's projections, to see what it is like and\nthen to say no to them when they then get upset. \"Why are you saying no? If you stay with this, this is going to be that.\" You just have to accept that that is a pattern for you.\n\n46.6 Integrity\n\nIf you look for a place of real wisdom in the abstract process, that's when you come to the 46.6. We know how sixth lines rise above any given situation and that when they are young, they get involved in what\ntheir line is all about and they learn very quickly that that does not work very well. This line is called\nIntegrity and it is a Saturn/Neptune combination.\n\nSaturn exalted. The wisdom to secure one's identity through careful consideration of the restrictive potential of commitments. Neptune in detriment. Deceiving oneself and others by over-extending one's\nresources and eventually being in the position of having to break promises. The 46.6, like the whole 46th gate, has the quality within them that if they do accept the experience that they are in, there is going to be\nreward.\n\nThe other thing is that they have to be in the experience. The 46.6 learns very quickly that it is not the experience at all that is the thing because it gets to see the whole circuit. It gets to see that the whole\ncircuit is based on the impersonal contact between humans. They realize that the abstract process is faulty in the sense that the experience itself takes one away from the real wisdom that is possible, because it is\nthe people. Like in collective sexuality in the 35/36, 41 /30, what you have is experience and excitement that has nothing to do with the actual person. The one thing the 46.6 knows is that success is absolutely\ndependent on the other person, and that the experience is just a catalyst, but it is the other person or the collective sharing that can result in real success.\n\nThe 46.6 is not limited to just looking at this drive in the sacral center to say 'yes' to life, to experience, to commitments. It goes beyond that. It looks into the whole circuitry. It sees the obsession. It sees the crisis.\nIt sees the progress. It sees the possibilities that are there. It sees that experience can make a contribution to the direction of humanity.\n\nRemember, the direction of humanity is towards beauty, aesthetics and harmony. That is our direction.\nThe reality is that only an experience whose net value is to show the beauty and the harmony possible in human direction, only then is that experience worth having. That is quite a criterion. You can sit up there\non the fence for a long time to wait and see, to find that experience that, being in it, ultimately, is of value to humanity.\n\nIn the white book: The determination to say no to restrictive commitments; or A drive for success that will not say no and will end up breaking promises. But all of this happens when they're young. This is not\nsomething that is necessarily part of their mature life, unless you have people who are very Mars-oriented.\nThe 46.6 goes to the 18.1. It goes to work on What has been spoilt. It goes to the need to correct within a collective process. A need to find what is worth challenging, and what is challenging. What is worth\ncorrecting? What is of value to humanity? The 46.6 is not likely to be an obvious success in this life because, for them, it will be dependent on how clear they are about the nature of the beings around them.\nTheir success is dependent on that and, like all good sixth lines, as they sit up there on the roof of the house, they are checking out all the possibilities. They are looking at those different people, trying to see\nwho, in fact, can help make success possible.\n\nIt is a very difficult position and yet, it is one that carries within it a deep inherent wisdom. That is the real integrity. Real integrity is that you can have any kind of experience as long as that is an experience that\n\nPage 6\n\nyou can fully put yourself into and realize that it is of substance, that it can be of value in terms of being able to bring something out of that back into the collective. We have two kinds of teachers: the 46.6 is the\nteacher of experience, and those teachers of experience really benefit us. They save us time, they smooth our way and provide us with all kinds of opportunities. That is the possibility that lies within this integrity\nof the sixth line. The 18.1 is the adherence to conservative patterns. What to challenge, this is the dilemma here.\n\nPage 7",

The moment that the leader is not accepting\nthe limitation but giving others the direction of trying to break that limitation, they are only going to be confronted with a new limitation. So the leader, the one at the top, is confusing all the others below,\nguiding them to believe that they can break the limitation when in fact they cannot because another limitation will simply replace it.\n\nAll fifth lines are in a dilemma in which they may or may not be equipped to live up to the projection of others. You see that the detriment of fifth lines is not able to live up to that. If you are a 60.5, you have all\nthese people who are waiting for you to act.

They can lead others into limitations and trying to break them when, in fact, once you have broken them, there is still another limitation.\n\nThis is the way they used to punish prisoners in America. They would make them dig a trench, a long ditch or a huge hole in the ground. At the end of the day they go to sleep, and the next morning they go\nout to the same place and they have to fill it all back in. You get rid of that limitation, you dig your way out of that and then you fill it back in, and you start all over again. This is very depressing. This is the\nnature of this detriment. It can end up being very depressive for whatever value that has, to be guided to constantly break the limitation that cannot be broken.\n\nLimitations cannot be broken, they can only be transcended. When it says in the detriment, 'confusion coming from the top', it means it is coming from the leader. The moment that the leader is not accepting\nthe limitation but giving others the direction of trying to break that limitation, they are only going to be confronted with a new limitation. So the leader, the one at the top, is confusing all the others below,\nguiding them to believe that they can break the limitation when in fact they cannot because another limitation will simply replace it.\n\nAll fifth lines are in a dilemma in which they may or may not be equipped to live up to the projection of others. You see that the detriment of fifth lines is not able to live up to that. If you are a 60.5, you have all\nthese people who are waiting for you to act. You may be under so much pressure that you are depressed by not acting because every individual wants to play out that role in which they can provide that guidance\nand direction."

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 60 LIMITATION\n\nOne of the format energies. Every time I have to deal with the 3rd hexagram, I would like to spend six or seven days talking about it because it is an incredible thing. Anybody who has the 60th hexagram has a\ndeep connection to the whole mutative process that exists through the 3. This format energy generates the whole mutative field. The thing to recognize is that the 3rd gate is the most mutative gate because it\norders what will become new. It is like a pool of material, all of which has a mutative potential. It is all of the mutative potential that is rooted in the whole history of the individual process. It goes all the way\nback. In the mystical sense, the 3rd gate always represents what is new and the 60th gate represents what is old.\n\nThe Limitation is what has always been up to this pulse. If it could speak, this would be its mantra. \"This is what has always been up to this pulse, up to this moment.\" Then there is the pulse; when it comes back\nthrough the 3, something new may emerge out of what was the limitation. The 60 carries within it a very special value, and we are living through the 60 energy for the last couple of years (1995-1999) with\nUranus and Neptune in this gate. It means that the genetic pool, all the possibility for mutation in the genetic pool, is activated when the 60th gate is present. My relationship with Jurgen, for example. Jurgen\nhas the 3rd gate and I have the 60th gate, and in this kind of connection mutation is something that is possible.\n\nThe 60th gate is the gate of acceptance. This is so important to understand. Every single one of the gates that come out of the root center that form the formats is a gate of potential depression. The depression\nrooted in the 60th gate says, \"This is the way it has always been. This may be the way it will always be.\"\nIt is looking for the mutation. It is looking for something new. The energy is the pulse, and it is the pressure to mutate. \"I am tired of the old. I am tired of this limitation. I want to transcend the limitation; I\nwant to bring out something new.\" It is always sitting there, waiting.\n\nUnless the limitation is accepted, transcendence is never possible. The fuel quality is restrained and it is depressive. This is one of the things to understand. All individuality, every individual gate that you have,\nis melancholic by nature. Melancholy is about happy and sad. It is not emotional. Please understand that.\nIt can be when it is out of the 22/12/ 39/55. If it is not out of one of these gates, it is a mechanical moodiness. It is a moodiness of happy and sad. In that sense, the depressiveness of all individuals is\nsubject to melancholy and it becomes more and more intense when they feel limited. The only way to transcend the limitation is through mutation.\n\nIt says above the lines: The acceptance of limitation is the first step in transcendence. Nothing is more complex than knowing. It has more gates. There is more circuitry involved. It is deeply complex for\nknowing to really mean something that is truly clear. The first step in transcendence is to accept limitation. All individuals have to accept limitation as the beginning of their transcendence process.\nOtherwise, they can never transcend. They have to accept the limitation of being individual.\n\n60.1 Acceptance\n\nThe first line is called Acceptance. As we know, the first line forms the foundation. This introspective line has Venus exalted. The ability to maintain inner harmony when confronted by external limitations. This is\na key here. Harmonic energy that can deal with external limitations. This is what the 60th gate is all about, to accept limitations and maintain your harmony, to allow the limitation to be there because the\none thing that the 60 knows (this is not about awareness knowing; this is in its genetic material) is that mutation is always possible. The limitation can always be transcended at some point. All it has to do is to\naccept the limitation.\n\nPage 1\n\nMercury in detriment. The drive for diversity that when limited, can become restless and agitated. Here lies the melancholy that is inherent in the 60th hexagram and inherent in the individual process. That is\nthe chafing against limitations: the individual that is forced to be influenced. Put an individual child in the classroom where it is forced to be influenced, forced to be disciplined, forced to be communal, forced to\nbe collective. All of these forces imposed on them and them having to accept the limitation, they become restless.\n\nI have my design Mercury in this line. I had a wonderful experience when Neptune came to the 60th hexagram. Under normal circumstances, with my Mercury in this position, whenever I was confronted by\nlimitation I would immediately get restless. Once I found that out about myself through design, it became something very valuable to me. I often use this example to help people understand that detriments are not\nbad. The moment I recognized how my Mercury operated, I recognized that what it was doing to me was a great service. It was always pointing out to me the moment that I was not accepting my limitations.\nBecause it was mechanical, it did not require awareness. So the moment I saw my own restlessness, then I could look and see: What is it that I am not accepting? Why am I suddenly so restless? Since Neptune is\ntransiting the 60th gate, I don't have this. It is veiled. I do not have this normal mercurial contact in me, it is just veiled. It is just not there. This is an interesting process.\n\nRestless energy when confronted with external limitations. I was the kind of person that whenever there was an external limitation that I could not overcome, I would get very melancholic. It would make me\nsad. That sadness would drive me in my restlessness to get out of that situation. What is lying at the very root of the individual process is that nothing is going to happen for the individual until they accept their\ntrue nature, until they accept their limitation, their individuality, until they accept that they are a freak, that they have to explain themselves, that they are different, that they accept that nothing is permanent,\nthat mutation can always take place. Then, they are open to transcendence. The 60th gate will provide the genetic material as a mutation that will lead to what can be knowable. The 60th gate is biological.\n\n60.2 Decisiveness\n\nWhen we get to the second line, we get to the line of projecting outwards. These people are projecting outwards that they can accept limitation. Most of them can suffer a great deal from the pressure in their\nlife. Remember that this is just a projection of the nature of this hexagram going out. It does not necessarily mean that they really are accepting the limitation. What they project outwards is that they are\naccepting the limitation.\n\nThis line is called Decisiveness. Saturn exalted. The understanding of the nature of limitation, to accept its restraints when necessary and thus be able to take advantage of opportunities when they arise. In the\nwhite book: Energy which can adapt to restraint. Basically, these people project outwards that they are restrained. They don't know that there is anything at the other end of the channel. So every once in a\nwhile somebody breaks through that and they have a doorway to that limitation. Generally speaking, these people are always going to be restrained and in that restraint, in accepting that limitation as a projection,\nthere can also be the deep melancholy inside: Why am I accepting this limitation? Is this limitation really of value? Is this limitation the right direction? Is this limitation the mutation that is necessary for me?\n\nWhen we come to the other side, to the Earth in detriment, we have: An adaptation to restraint that becomes habitual and maintains the nature of the limitation even when it no longer exists. This is the\nwhole thing to recognize about this second line. Because it projects out that it will accept the limitation and be restrained, the exalted side is always open to the possibility that the limitation will end and then it\nwill seem like, \"Aha, to accept the limitation was the right thing to do.\"\n\nPage 2\n\nOn the detriment side of this energy: The energy for adaptation that can get stuck without eventual mutation. The limitation suddenly gets taken away. You have somebody who goes for a walk every day in\nWest Berlin. When they get to the place where the wall is, they turn around and walk home. When you take away the wall, they do not cross that point. The limitation is gone but no mutation, no change of the\npath or the way. This is the other side of this second line.\n\nThere is a deep addiction to the limitation in the second line: people who get addicted to their medicine even when they are healthy.\n\n60.3 Conservatism\n\nIndividuals, by their very nature, get stuck in habits. They eat the same food every day, they go for the same walk every day and in accepting the limitation, it is always possible that the mutation can take place\nand something extraordinary happens. Very often, they just get stuck in the very habit itself.\n\nWhen you come to the third line, you have the theme of trial and error, of bonds made and broken, and it is called Conservatism. Saturn exalted. Enlightened self-interest that naturally handles restrictions and\nlimitations, ensuring identity and security. 'Enlightened self- interest...' This is the gate of limitation but this is the third line which can always break the bond of the limitation. It does not mean that they\ntranscend the limitation. By breaking the bond, they discover that a new limitation comes in their way.\nThis is their learning process until they finally can get to the point where they can accept that limitation will come and be transcended on its own terms and not on theirs.\n\nRemember the mystery of mutation. It takes place between the pulses, in the gap between the pulses. It is truly a mystery. What goes out old comes back new and one has not participated in that moment of\ntransition from one to the other.\n\nIn the white book this Conservatism is: The energy to maintain identity and security despite limitations.\nThat identity and security is there in the individual. They say, \"I break this bond with this limitation. I will not sit here and hold back. I go over there.\" They hold on to their identity and to the security of who they\nare but at the same time, when they go over there, they will meet another limitation and they have to deal with the same thing again. Just because they break the bond does not mean that they transcend the\nlimitation. This is their learning process but ultimately, in its resonance, it can lead to wisdom.\n\nOn the other side, we have Mars in detriment. The ego gratifying self-interest that ignores limitations and suffers predictably. It ignores the limitations because it can break the bond, but it is not breaking the bond\nhoping to transcend it. It is breaking the bond only to get away from it. In trying to get away from it, one will suffer the consequences because you can't. It can lead to the melancholy and the depression that is\nalways possible in the 60th gate.\n\nEnergy which ignores limitations and pays the price. Again, do not see these detriments as being negative.\nThis is not the case. What appears to be a negative is not. It depends on the nature of your awareness. In the individual process, we will always meet individuals who will ignore limitations and are willing to pay\nthe price. After all, this is the format for individuality and if you get to the behavior of individuality in the\n10.3, you get to The Martyr. It is built in here to break the limitation and pay the price. So many of us honor martyrs. Go to any little town to their square and you will see a statue of someone who has been a\nmartyr. They are exalted afterwards. They will pay the price. Everything has a price. This is not negative.\nIt is only a mechanic.\n\n60.4 Resourcefulness\n\nPage 3\n\nThe fourth line and fifth lines in this hexagram have a very special advantage. V% know that they are by their very nature transpersonal. They can go across the channel and recognize that there will always be\nthat process at the other end. Built into the genetic recognition of the 60th hexagram is that the 3rd hexagram and its mutative capacity is always waiting on the other side. People who have the fourth and\nfifth lines of the 60th hexagram have a much deeper capacity of accepting temporary limitation and the constant recognition, the constant deep knowing within them, that mutation is something that is always\npossible and will come, because they will meet it all the time.\n\nThis line is called Resourcefulness. It lies in being able to release oneself from the pressure to mutate. In recognizing that, by accepting the limitation, you know that the mutation will come anyway because you\nknow that there is a 3rd gate at the other end.\n\nMercury exalted. The reasoned and intelligent maximization of potential within limitations. In other words, while you are waiting for that limitation to end, it does not mean that your whole life gets focused\non that. The moment that your whole life gets focused on waiting for the limitation to end, you will be melancholic and depressed. These people have a very sad look on their face. Rather than waiting for the\nmutation to come, this is simply about: there are other things to do. Let's do other things within this limitation because deep inside of us we know that mutation is always possible. In the white book: The\nmaximization of potential within limitation.\n\nVenus in detriment. A tendency in times of limitations to seek the inner meaning of the restriction rather than using its gifts to find a harmonic application within the limitation. The former leads to withdrawal\nand the latter to transcendence. In other words, transcendence is always possible in being fixed in accepting the limitation. The detriment in this case is always going to have difficulties with that and as the\nline says: The energy to know rather than accept limitation at the expense of possible mutation, leading to depression.\n\nIt is very important for anybody who has the fourth line of the 60 and has never come to understand this through Human Design to recognize that the moment that they understand that the 3 is there and will\nalways be there for them, is the opportunity for them to accept the limitation and work within it.\n\nRemember that individuals do not like being limited. But the limitation always has to be there for them before transcendence can be possible. By the way, in the vast majority of cases, people who have Venus\nin this line are going to suffer from a lot of depression. Depression is also going to be evidenced in the way in which they look at the world in which, for them, there are all kinds of bad people and good people.\nThey have a deep moralistic twinge with Venus being the force behind that. Very important for these people to know how mutation works and the fact that it is always something that is possible for them.\n\n60.5 Leadership\n\nWhenever we get to the fifth line, we get to how the hexagram is perceived by others. It is interesting to recognize that this individual limitation, this acceptance, is considered a leadership function by the\ntotality. In other words, this leads to what we know in the 2/14, in the channel of being a Keeper of Keys, as the individual providing direction for the totality, and that capacity is in the recognition that within the\n60 lies all of this old information. It is there. Because it has this equipment, it is projected on it that it can also naturally take them to the next stage.\n\nLeadership. Neptune exalted. That is a lovely place for Neptune being exalted. Totally veiled. The awareness that the destruction of the old limitations simply creates new ones. This is the resonance to the\nsecond line, to the Decisiveness, where this lesson is first understood. This results in behavioral patterns that demonstrate this understanding through actions and enhances leadership potential. This is so\n\nPage 4\n\nimportant. If a limitation is not transcended, the fifth line knows that you have to wait and accept what is until it can be transcended and in that sense, it has a leadership capacity. It can act as a role model and it\ncan guide others to wait.\n\nIn the white book: The energy to handle a lifelong process of dealing with limitations. Other people are always projecting on the person with the 60.5 that they can handle a limitation, and thus they draw the\nconclusion: if they can handle the limitation and we can't, they are certainly the ones that can guide us through when that limitation ends. That may or may not be true.\n\nJupiter in detriment. Where the natural desire for expansion, when limitations are essential, creates confusion from the top. This is the whole thing about the fifth line. Due to it being projected upon, it does\nnot mean that it really got it. It is given the opportunity to get it, to show that it can accept the limitation until the time is appropriate to make the transcendence.\n\nIn the white book: Expansive energy that cannot handle limitations. But other people are dependent on this energy; in that sense, the whole planet, because without mutation, evolution is a dead end street. So\nthe capacity to lead is always projected onto the 60.5. They can lead others into limitations and trying to break them when, in fact, once you have broken them, there is still another limitation.\n\nThis is the way they used to punish prisoners in America. They would make them dig a trench, a long ditch or a huge hole in the ground. At the end of the day they go to sleep, and the next morning they go\nout to the same place and they have to fill it all back in. You get rid of that limitation, you dig your way out of that and then you fill it back in, and you start all over again. This is very depressing. This is the\nnature of this detriment. It can end up being very depressive for whatever value that has, to be guided to constantly break the limitation that cannot be broken.\n\nLimitations cannot be broken, they can only be transcended. When it says in the detriment, 'confusion coming from the top', it means it is coming from the leader. The moment that the leader is not accepting\nthe limitation but giving others the direction of trying to break that limitation, they are only going to be confronted with a new limitation. So the leader, the one at the top, is confusing all the others below,\nguiding them to believe that they can break the limitation when in fact they cannot because another limitation will simply replace it.\n\nAll fifth lines are in a dilemma in which they may or may not be equipped to live up to the projection of others. You see that the detriment of fifth lines is not able to live up to that. If you are a 60.5, you have all\nthese people who are waiting for you to act. You may be under so much pressure that you are depressed by not acting because every individual wants to play out that role in which they can provide that guidance\nand direction.\n\n60.6 Rigidity\n\nThe sixth line is the line of transition and here it is in a mutative gate and a mutative channel. So, it represents a mutation that can be quite profound in the nature of what is possible in the mutative field.\nThe line itself is called Rigidity, and it has Uranus exalted.\n\nThe intuitive intellect to recognize when absolute rigidity is essential but with innovative applications to lessen its severity. A fixed energy that is unusual in its capacity for restraint. One of the things about the\nnature of the sixth line is that it is so clear to it that restraint and limitation is everything because remember that all sixth lines are looking at the whole circuit and they are looking at it in order to see\nwhether or not they make a commitment to whatever their theme is. This sixth line in its rigidity is saying that there cannot be any kind of commitment. \"I will be restrained. I will accept any limitation because\n\nPage 5\n\nnothing will work unless mutation is present. If the mutation is not there, I will be absolutely rigid in restraint.\" What that means is that these are people who are very rigid in accepting their limitations and\nthey will rarely engage at that level.\n\nWhen you come to the other side, you have Mercury in detriment. The dogmatic, principled and carefully reasoned understanding that is uncompromising in its severity and often coldly brutal in operation. In the\nwhite book: An uncompromising and severe acceptance of restraint, so uncompromising that the restraint may become unbearable and lead to chronic depression. Here is somebody who says, \"I have to be\nrestrained. I have to accept the limitation. Otherwise, there will never be mutation, but I hate it. It is driving me crazy. Why can't there be a mutation? I can't stand it.\" This is being so unhappy with the\nrigidity and being fixed on it. When you say to these people, \"Hey, relax\", they get annoyed and depressed at you recognizing their rigidity, that they are stuck in that, that they hold on to that.\n\nWhat happens to the sixth line here is that, in our genetic terms, very little mutation comes out of the sixth line that affects the nature of the genetic material of a human being. It is rare that any genetic material is\nmutated through this line. When it does mutate, it does not bring a mutation that is recent but brings a mutation that is deeply recessive. It brings something out from deep down somewhere in the past. That\ncan be of enormous value or not, like all things having to do with the nature of mutation.\n\nWhat is important to see is that where the 59.6 will refuse to be intimate and may never be fertile because it cannot see that intimacy is worthwhile, the 60.6 will not provide any mutation because it is not going to\nengage because of its rigidity. So they will not provide a lot of mutative material. The mutative material will only come in those instances where the mutation is so profound that the whole process of the\nindividual circuit can be lived out. For the sixth line, the only limitation that can be transcended is a limitation that is truly transcended. It is gone, over, finished, onto something new, and until that moment,\nthey can suffer a great deal from being forced within their own nature to wait and be restrained, to accept the limitation.\n\nThis line always reminds me of a story. There is a monk going to a Zen temple and says, \"I want to see the master.\" The gardener brings them inside and tells them to take off their shoes and sit in the garden. A\ncouple of minutes later he comes back and says to this man, \"I am very sorry, you have to come back in\n20 years. We will call you and we will tell you when you can come.\" The monk becomes totally rigid in this acceptance of the limitation that he cannot see the master, and he comes back every year, takes his\nshoes off, goes into the garden and asks whether he could see the master. That story has a joke to it because one day he comes, takes off his shoes and is allowed to see the master. The gardener comes and\ntells him, \"The master will see you today.\" In that moment of the rigid limitation being broken, he is very excited and nervous. He goes wandering around in the garden and finally finds the master sitting there.\nThe master looks up to him and says, \"Where did you leave your shoes?\" Of course, he couldn't remember. The master sent him away. No mutation took place.\n\nPage 6",

The 62nd gate, the only other gate of detail, is also part of this logical circuit which is being\nfueled by this format energy. So detail is very important. There is no detail possible without focus. The reality is that this fifth line is how the outside sees this hexagram, and what they see is the capacity for\nexplanation.\n\nThink about what it is like. You have a group of people that are discussing something. Let's say they are politicians. They are talking all night and they are going back and forth. There is one person in the group\n\nPage 4\n\nwho said nothing. The moment that that person begins to speak, everybody listens because they respect the long silence. There is something about these people who are focused that we respect. We respect the\nfact that they are really going through everything and therefore they are really able to tell us. This fifth line gets projected on. They have that opportunity to become that kind of fuel for that process, to use their\nfocus to fuel detail which is on the other side, which is what they are looking for and what they need.\n\nThis is the universalization of this hexagram. What that means is that, universally on this planet, what is built into us is the recognition that only after there has been this focus and concentration is there anything\nreally worth respecting when it comes to knowledge. We are all deeply impressed when a theory we hear about suddenly becomes something that is proven valid and brought into the world. There are all kinds of\npeople working on that, being focused and concentrated to bring it to that final point, and this is what we respect in the logical process. The thing is that the 52.5 people are projected on to be ready to focus on the\ndetails. They may or may not be focused. It is simply a projected field.\n\nThe line is called Explanation. In times of inaction, the often important ability to explain ones position.\nThe Earth exalted, like in the first line which means that this is a very stable force that both defines the exalted nature of the hexagram and defines the way the exalted is perceived from the outside. The often\nterse but exceedingly accurate statement. This is the person who sits up all night and finally says, \"That is all wrong. Let me tell you how it works.\"\n\nIn the white book: Where inaction and focus can lead to detail. It can lead to detail. Remember that it is not complete without its process on the other side.\n\nPluto in detriment. Pluto is coming to the 9th gate in December 1997 which means that this detriment will be the active theme in the world, and all the babies that are born during this transit that have the 52, will\nhave this aspect fixed in them. This will be a very important vibration that will come into the world in the next few years. It will be around for about 70 or 80 years. Because it is Pluto, it means that this particular\naspect of our logical process, the aspect of our universalization, hasn't been in the world for a long time.\nA convolution whose enigmatic nature is revealed in unpredictable circumstances and normally misunderstood. What you have here is: Where too much inaction can lead to a loss of focus and not to\ndetail.\n\nThis age is coming upon us. When I go to America, one of the things that I discover is that people don't go to work anymore. They don't have to. They sit in their guarded apartment complex that has armed\nguards at the bottom, with their computer. They are connected to the headquarters of their company. They have a supermarket, a bank, a pharmacy inside of their building.

They can't do it if there is somebody around them pressuring them to see the detail. That is a classic example for this line. It is a question of perspective.

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 52 KEEPING STILL (MOUNTAIN)\n\nWe switch over to the logical format. When looking at the 58th hexagram, there is the obvious polarity of the 58 and 52. They are an opposition in the Zodiac. I have pointed out to you the importance of energy\nfor the logical process, that is, the need to be able to energize experimentation in order to be able to guarantee or secure the future for the collective.\n\nThe 52nd hexagram, Keeping Still, is the gate of stillness. It is an energy that is focused and it is the pressure to concentrate. This is the enormous difference between the 52 and the 53. This needing to be\nfocused and concentrated is so diametrically opposed to the cyclical process of beginning things and finishing them. One of the things that are very clear about the nature of the logical process and format is\nthat, in order for logical things to succeed, there must be a deep identification in order that repetition and focusing is possible. One has to be deeply identified with the formula in order to spend a lifetime proving\nor disproving it. This is quite a dedication.\n\nThe fuel quality is passive and this is not about stress but about tension. The great depression of the 52 is the tension that one will not find the right thing to focus on. It is very depressing for this energy that has\nits pressure on concentrating when there is nothing worthwhile to concentrate on.\n\nSomething very important to understand is that the next step of the Plutonian process is to go into the 9th gate. (Pluto entered the 9th gate in 1998.) So we will have an enormous amount of power for a very deep\nfocus and concentration. It is the plutonic field that will be the source of that focus of attention.\n\nAbove the lines of the 52 it says, Temporary and self-imposed inaction for the benefit of assessment. This is the whole thing of what the tension is. The tension is there during the assessment process because there\nis nothing to do. Unless there is something to concentrate on, there is nothing to do.\n\nThat is why I joke and call this the gate of the Buddha. Keeping still (Mountain). Buddha sits under the tree with his 52 and he does not know what to do because he knows that he is not in charge of the doing.\nSo he just sits there. He is enlightened because he does not have any tension while he is sitting there. This is the truth for all. The moment that you recognize that while he is sifting there, he is waiting for the\nperfect opportunity to find something worth concentrating on. In that moment of finding something worth concentrating on, there is the power to really concentrate and thus there is real fulfillment in that process.\n\n52.1 Think before you speak\n\nThink about all the pressure that is on the 52nd gate. There is a lot of pressure on the 58th gate to commit its energy to experimentation, and there is enormous pressure on the 52nd to commit its energy to\nconcentration. But the reality is that the theme of this gate, the first line, the introspection, is: Think before you speak.\n\nEarth exalted in the foundation of the hexagram is the real grounding. This is the real stability in the logical process. The pause that is so profound that it leads to silence. There is nothing to do and nothing\nto say until the moment that there is something of value to concentrate on. This annoys people. Anybody who is involved in the logical process is desperate and hungry for energy and gets really annoyed that\nBuddha is under the tree when the fields need to be plowed. They get very annoyed that the energy is not available to figure out and control who is going to plow, when it will get plowed. Who will keep the\nrecords and how are we going to concentrate on all of that. That energy is missing and therefore, there are all kinds of forces. This is a collective gate and the most important collective process for us because it\nensures our health and stability. If these people are not doing, are not providing their energy, they have all kinds of pressure from other people. This pressure begins in the detriment.\n\nPage 1\n\nMars in detriment. Speaking first... (under pressure to commit their energy) ...and living with the consequences afterwards.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The pacification of energy that leads to stillness. \"It is not time. I will not commit myself to this process of intense focus and concentration unless there is something there which is of\nvalue. There has to be.\"\n\nThe Martian side is: Energy that cannot be stilled. These are the two sides of the concentrated process.\nThese are the two sides of the way logic operates. Those forces in the 52 that do keep still and wait, their energy is of enormous value when it is committed. Those who are always ready, like the Mars, to step out\nof that, never get the focus and concentration necessary for their process in life.\n\nLet me try to clarify that even further for you. The 58 and the 52 are in opposition to each other. Both of these gates are the only natural fuels for the logical process. So, when anybody meets the 52nd gate, they\nwant it to act like the 58th gate. In other words, they want the 52 to act like a motor gate and just simply fuel the activity of correction and challenging authority. That is not what the 52nd gate is about. It is\nabout using energy passively. It is not about rushing out into the fields to plow them. It is about sitting under a tree, imagining how a field can be properly plowed and not making any kind of commitment to\nthe collective until one has figured out in one's concentration, in one's focus, that there are certain ways that the fields should be plowed. While the person is sitting under the tree, all of its friends are working in\nthe fields and they would love to have that motor energy of the 52. The 52 is at its best when it is sitting under that tree and not moving a muscle, but musing about the nature of field plowing.\n\nThat focus and concentration is what the collective needs. The logical collective requires that. It is not the\n58th gate. Because we only have these two gates and because the logic is starved for energy, the 52 is under enormous pressure to act like the 58 and not be what it really is. The 52 is the pause, the silence for\nthe concentration, for the focus. This is where the contribution can be made.\n\n52.2 Concern\n\nThe second line is about projection. What is projected outwards here is the nature of this hexagram which is that this person can be focused. This person then is under pressure to concentrate. When they are\nlooking at a magazine and you walk up to them and say, \"Do you want a cup of coffee?\" they get really annoyed because they are trying to focus on what is in front of them. They are projecting out this field.\n\nIt is called Concern. Venus exalted. The pause that is initiated to benefit others. Mars in detriment. A selfish and abrupt pause that may endanger others unnecessarily. By the way, they are the same thing.\n\nIn the white book: The pressure to restrain energy for the benefit of others; or The pressure to selfishly restrain energy at the expense of others. All of that is about projection. Remember, the person with the\nsecond line is not introspective. They are putting out a field of energy and it is being projected on by either side. So, if you are a person who has the Venus here, it is always projected on you that you are\nsitting back and being focused and concentrated for the benefit of everybody else. You are sitting under a tree and trying to figure out how to best plow the fields. If you have the other side, everybody is saying,\nout of that projection, \"They are sitting under a tree because they are selfish and because they do not want to work like we want to work, and they are not doing a damn thing under that tree.\"\n\nWhen the 52 is connected to the throat, they can do. For example, you take a 14- year-old child in middle- school and you sit them down for an examination; their focus and concentration will burn more calories\n\nPage 2\n\nthan a 20 kilometer walk. So it is not about not doing. There are all kinds of doing. The energy is being used, but passively.\n\n52.3 Controls\n\nWhen you are dealing with the first to third lines in the 52, you are dealing with collective circuitry. You know right away that it is very difficult for these people at times to deal with this phenomenon. After all,\nfirst to third lines are not really equipped to deal with the other side. That is not their focus. Their focus is much more internalized. When you get to the third line, the line of trial and error, you have an aspect of\nthe first and second line but you have this trial and error which is immediately going to bump into others.\nThe third line brings in the beginnings of the interaction with the other side and this is where the whole trial and error phenomenon is.\n\nIt is called Controls. It says: External enforcement of inaction. If you have a child with the 52.3, it is told, \"You go into your room and concentrate.\" External enforcement of inaction. \"No, you can't get out and\nplay. You sit there and practice the piano.\"\n\nSaturn exalted. The ability by its very nature to understand restraint with the potential in acceptance to use the period to redefine strategies. The energy for acceptance in inaction. What happens on this side is that\nthese people are always going to be restrained by outside forces. Those outside forces will restrain them, but not all the time. So, as long as on this side they can accept the restraint, it is okay. The child that is\ntold that it must practice the piano may one day look back and say, \"I am so grateful that my parents forced me to practice because this is my life and I love this instrument, but I hated the practicing back\nthen.\" In other words, this is the part of the format that has to be strongly guided by its interaction with others.\n\nThere is a lot of trial and error in that because remember, those people who are logical, who will gravitate to somebody who has the 52, they want the 52 to be like the 58. They want them to be a motor energy that\nwill fuel manifestation or generation, and that they will fuel activity, rather than accepting that the 52 is there to fuel passive focus and concentration.\n\nThe other side is Venus in detriment. A deep dissatisfaction with controls that disturbs tranquility, leads to emotional withdrawal and affects vision. The pressure of restraint disturbs tranquility. These are the\npeople who are forced to practice and who really hate it. It disturbs them because it takes them away from the stillness they had before they were told that they had to practice. These are the ones that don't end up\nplaying the instrument in their lives. They end up being focused on whatever is natural for them but have a deep resistance to being controlled. Again, this is all trial and error. There will be a lot of mistakes along\nthe way. 'Miss-take', like in the movies, is just another 'take' and nothing bad.\n\n52.4 Self-discipline\n\nThe fourth line is actually the exalted line because you have a channel that is all about being fixed and focused. We know that fourth line themes are about being fixed and one-tracked and single-minded. So,\nobviously the nature of this fourth line in this particular gate and channel is really the key force at work in this hexagram.\n\nIt says: Self -discipline. Saturn exalted. Perfected self-discipline and restraint that deals easily and wisely with impulsive temptations. The energy for restraint which recognizes the value of stillness and focus.\nBasically, rather than trying to intellectualize that, the root center is not aware. The 52.4's are people who, on principle, focus and concentrate, which means that they are focused and concentrated on everything.\nThey take their time over what to buy, to see, where to go and what to do in their lives. They will always\n\nPage 3\n\nrequire and (because it is built into them) are fixed in needing the spaces of silence, this pause where they go through and work it all out and can finally come to some kind of decision.\n\nJupiter in detriment. Though responsive to the need of a principled control based on the understanding of conditions, there is a tendency due to its natural expansiveness to doubt and restlessness. In other words,\nessentially it operates exactly the same way. These fourth line people are very fixed on being focused.\nEverything for them is about being focused. The only difference with the Jupiter is that this planet, once in a while, says, \"I don't do this. Why are we focused on this? Is this the right thing to be focused on?\"\nThis is something that can come out of this energy in the fourth line. When you meet these people, you have to see that no one can ever have the power to take these people out of their focus. They can only\nparticipate in the focus with them. Remember that the fourth line knows that there is a 9th gate over there.\nIt recognizes that, and when it meets the other side which needs focus and concentration, they together can really bring the format to fruition.\n\nIf you take somebody in a classroom and you have the fourth line of the 52, and you have the 9. 1 or the\n9.4, you will have the classroom filled with people who are deeply focused and concentrated because this is the ideal for what we call research. It is the ideal for being fixed on the repetition of the pattern and all\nthe other things that go with the logical process.\n\nFor other people who are not logical, these people are not to be understood. They have this incredible power gate and the other circuits bang into that and say, \"I want some energy. Give me the energy,\" and\nthey do not get this active energy from the 52. They get passive energy. It is very difficult for them to come to these 52.4 people because they will not break their focus. They will not lift their head and look at\nyou if they are caught up in something. They will annoy others because they won't break their focus, and many of us call these people neurotic. This is the great line of neurosis but not in the sense that they are\nneurotic (they are not); they are living out their nature, but in the sense of how it is perceived by others because they do not seem to be able to break their focus. They even appear to be obsessive. They are not.\nThis is a very fixed line in a very fixed gate. It is very fixed and that is its way. They have the focus.\n\nThey have what is called 'the brown study' which is when you look out the window but you don't see.\nThis is focus without concentration. So you have somebody who is sitting in front of their newspaper and they are starring at the newspaper but they are not reading anything. They are in a deep focus which\nannoys other people. Are you reading that paper?\n\nObviously, with the 9 there, when Pluto is coming in that gate, this capacity to focus gets narrowed into its concentrated field. Then the clarity comes and the process begins. These 52.4 people can be seen as\nvery rigid and cold because they seem to ignore you. The 52.4's can be uncomfortable for other people, but anybody who is carrying the circuitry that goes from the 9 to the 5/15 to the 31/7, does not have that\nreaction to them. They are very much aware of whom these people are, and they are always seeking them out.\n\n52.5 Explanation\n\nEverything about this focus is in order to focus on detail. The gate on the other side is the Taming Power of the Small. The 62nd gate, the only other gate of detail, is also part of this logical circuit which is being\nfueled by this format energy. So detail is very important. There is no detail possible without focus. The reality is that this fifth line is how the outside sees this hexagram, and what they see is the capacity for\nexplanation.\n\nThink about what it is like. You have a group of people that are discussing something. Let's say they are politicians. They are talking all night and they are going back and forth. There is one person in the group\n\nPage 4\n\nwho said nothing. The moment that that person begins to speak, everybody listens because they respect the long silence. There is something about these people who are focused that we respect. We respect the\nfact that they are really going through everything and therefore they are really able to tell us. This fifth line gets projected on. They have that opportunity to become that kind of fuel for that process, to use their\nfocus to fuel detail which is on the other side, which is what they are looking for and what they need.\n\nThis is the universalization of this hexagram. What that means is that, universally on this planet, what is built into us is the recognition that only after there has been this focus and concentration is there anything\nreally worth respecting when it comes to knowledge. We are all deeply impressed when a theory we hear about suddenly becomes something that is proven valid and brought into the world. There are all kinds of\npeople working on that, being focused and concentrated to bring it to that final point, and this is what we respect in the logical process. The thing is that the 52.5 people are projected on to be ready to focus on the\ndetails. They may or may not be focused. It is simply a projected field.\n\nThe line is called Explanation. In times of inaction, the often important ability to explain ones position.\nThe Earth exalted, like in the first line which means that this is a very stable force that both defines the exalted nature of the hexagram and defines the way the exalted is perceived from the outside. The often\nterse but exceedingly accurate statement. This is the person who sits up all night and finally says, \"That is all wrong. Let me tell you how it works.\"\n\nIn the white book: Where inaction and focus can lead to detail. It can lead to detail. Remember that it is not complete without its process on the other side.\n\nPluto in detriment. Pluto is coming to the 9th gate in December 1997 which means that this detriment will be the active theme in the world, and all the babies that are born during this transit that have the 52, will\nhave this aspect fixed in them. This will be a very important vibration that will come into the world in the next few years. It will be around for about 70 or 80 years. Because it is Pluto, it means that this particular\naspect of our logical process, the aspect of our universalization, hasn't been in the world for a long time.\nA convolution whose enigmatic nature is revealed in unpredictable circumstances and normally misunderstood. What you have here is: Where too much inaction can lead to a loss of focus and not to\ndetail.\n\nThis age is coming upon us. When I go to America, one of the things that I discover is that people don't go to work anymore. They don't have to. They sit in their guarded apartment complex that has armed\nguards at the bottom, with their computer. They are connected to the headquarters of their company. They have a supermarket, a bank, a pharmacy inside of their building. They never have to go out into the street.\nIn the Western world, we have an evolution that is taking us towards this detriment which means that we are getting more and more inaction. There will be these deep passive processes that will overtake us on\nthe planet. The children born during this transit will live in a great technological age. They will live in a virtual world where they do not have to go anywhere, where going somewhere will be very dangerous.\nThis is something that is coming into the program.\n\nThe enigmatic nature of the convolution means that nobody knows what they are focused on. It is a misunderstanding about the nature of their silence, of their passive ability. In the end, they can explain\nthemselves but there is no throat here. This energy will not speak.\n\nIn the white book it says, '...too much inaction.' This is the enigmatic-ness, the inability to really be able to understand why that person is silent, why they are being passive because it does not seem to follow any\nlogical order. It seems very illogical to those who experience that from them. Other people put pressure on them to explain themselves and they can't. The moment that they are forced to try to bring it out before\nthey have completed their own very long inaction process, what comes out can lead to problems.\n\nPage 5\n\nThe genetic capacity here is simply to be still. It is projected on them that they can be still, but everybody expects that out of that stillness comes an explanation. The people who have the detriment do not\nnecessarily come out of that stillness with any explanation at all. Out of that stillness there is just stillness and this is impossible for logical people to understand. Why are you supposed to be concentrating on\nsomething? It is like the kid who is told to focus on a book that they have to read, and the teacher asks them whether they have read the book. They say, \"Yes, but I was not concentrating.\" This is this side. If it\nis projected on them that they have to be silent and read the book, they do so but they do not come up with the details telling what the book is all about. What they talk about is, \"It is nice to read this book. It\nis very quiet and peaceful in here.\" If somebody asks them to explain why, they can't and this infuriates the others. They say to them, \"but you are reading the book. Don't you know where it took place?\" \"I\ndon't know,\" and this explanation signals, \"Leave me in peace.\"\n\nIt is like the 3-D book. If you focus properly, you can see the three dimensional images inside. So, that is the exalted of it. The detriment would be that you are looking at the pattern, you can enjoy that but you\ndon't get to see what the detail is inside. It is funny because only certain people can go through and get to the third dimension and other people can never get to the third dimension, and some people can only get\nin there if they are alone. They can't do it if there is somebody around them pressuring them to see the detail. That is a classic example for this line. It is a question of perspective. When you look into the\nfuture, into infinity, then you get the right focus. When you look close and cross your eyes, you get the negative image. It is convoluted. It gets turned the other way and you don't see the detail, but you have the\nfocus.\n\n52.6 Peacefulness\n\nWhen you get to the sixth line it is called Peacefulness. The word peace shows up in quite a few sixth lines. You have The Peacemaker in the 6.6. Peacefulness is one of the great longings of sixth lines: the\npeacefulness of being able to look out at the whole circuitry and see the whole circuitry come to fulfillment. In seeing it come to fulfillment, there is this sense of peace that comes with it.\n\nVenus exalted. A harmonic and balanced attunement that is at ease, regardless of the situation. The lack of pressure in times of stillness. These people can be so free of pressure when they are still that they will\nnever provide their focus for anything or anyone. Like all sixth lines, they are looking for the capacity for that focus to have the right detail, that detail to have the right pattern, the pattern to have the right rhythm,\nthe rhythm to have the right role and the role to have the right influence. That is the nature of the circuit.\n\nThey are looking to see if the whole thing is possible. \"If I focus on the right details, the details come into my life and I focus on them, will all of that circuit be fulfilled?\" They do not often commit themselves.\nThe other thing that is very interesting here is that this line has Neptune in detriment and these people are alive in the world. Not long ago, in the 70's, Neptune was in the beginning of Sagittarius moving through\nthe 9th gate and 5th gate, which follows in this pattern. Thus we have a great many Neptunian people in the world.\n\nNeptune in detriment. Delusion... (Neptune always offers a spiritual opportunity. When you read this line, please think of the spiritual movements and the gurus of the 20th century.) ...as a substitute for genuine\ntranquility. Given the positive nature of this position, the delusion may be just as effective as the \"real thing. \"TM: the illusion is just a good as the real thing. When you see that, you really understand that\nthere is a very powerful transition movement alive in the world today that wants us to be able to transcend mundane logic and get us to a higher logic, that is, to get to the logic that is inherent in the hierarchy\nitself, to see the pattern. So the focus and concentration of the great scientific movements of our time are rooted in exploring the genetic code and the universe, to get all of the detail and to be able to bring it into\n\nPage 6\n\nperspective. This illusion on the other side. Again, very difficult for these people to commit themselves to be able to find something that really is a detail worth concentrating on, for the reason that they need to\nfeel somehow that it is possible that all of that can come to fruition and finally be able to manifest in the world.\n\nWhere the pacification of the energy is extreme, pressure, real or imagined, does not disturb the stillness.\nThere is so much pressure to be still that these people can live out the Buddha state and never know anything about the nature of Buddha consciousness. In other words, they can just be there and the\ndelusion that there are in the Buddha state is just as good. This is why we are open to virtual reality. We all know that it is not real. We can delude ourselves in that. Delusion is a way of life. By the way, the\ndelusion in the 16.1 is a theme of our time. So we are dealing with delusion as a very important element in our lives. Delusion and illusion. In this peacefulness of the 52.6, we see clearly that for the logical\nbeing, for the logical process, there is only one thing that they want and that is peace.\n\nWhen you get to the manifestation of the identity of the logical being and you get to the 31 st gate, to the gate of Influence, ultimately what the leader says is, \"Follow me. I will bring you peace and maintain\npeace.\" This is what it is all about. If you look at any society today, this is what you find: people who want to maintain the peace. We have always seen that this is a key to the logical process. There is no\nability for all of us to share collectively unless there is peace.\n\nThe peacefulness in the format, in this sixth line, is what the magic of the logical process can be. If we really figure out the pattern, if we really figure out logically what the formula is, maybe, just maybe, we\ncan all live in peace together. That may be my illusion or delusion about the nature of the Human Design\nSystem. I do not separate myself from the energy of its time but it seems clear to me that part of our work is that, when we come to a point of understanding the basic mechanic of things, that we are no longer\nignorant of our nature or the nature of the world, it will at least lessen the burden of life on us and we bring a much deeper peacefulness to our being.\n\nPage 7",

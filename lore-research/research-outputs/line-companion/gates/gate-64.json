The pressure below was a motor and the pressure above is not. It is only a pressure. It is like recycling. It circulates things and brings them back out, but it is not a motor. It is\njust a pressure. That means whatever that pressure instills in the nature of the ajna center, whatever pressure comes into being as a conceptualization within the ajna center carries within it no intrinsic power\nto manifest as action. It is so important to understand that. The mind, the ajna center, is exclusively for looking at the nature of being. That is what it is there for. It is not there to decide what to do. It is there to\nexamine at the three different levels of mental capability the experience of what it is to be alive in the world and it is not about doing.\n\nIn the Rave Reading seminar, in being able to define for people that nature of authority in one's design, the moment that you come to authority in your design, where your true authority is, you will discover that\nthe mind is obedient to that authority. Always. And the moment that you do not know the authority within yourself, the moment that you are not living out your nature, your mind is going to rule your life. This\nwill be very disturbing. The nature of inspiration, the nature of the head center and its pressure, in the collective sense of the word (that is, both in the abstract and in the logical collective) is that it is there to\nforce us mentally to make sense of the past (the abstract process) and to project into the future (the logical process) in order for us to see within the continuity, past and future, the nature of what it is to be human.\nBecause it is collective, we share that with each other.\n\nThe great law of the collective mind is that there is nothing new. There is this attempt to make sense out of the past and there is this projection into the future, all out of a relative present. Here in the 64th\nhexagram, Before Completion, we have the gate of confusion. Confusion, as you can see in the energy mechanic, is about cyclical mental images from the past. This is the gate of confusion because there are so\nmany cyclical mental images which are all from of the past and they are all jumbled together. When you look at its fuel, this is a pressure of mental activity or not. This can be the busiest and most uncomfortable\nmind or not. The moment that the mind is trying to run the life, this is very busy and uncomfortable as a pressure. It is confused. The moment the mind is not the authority in the life, this is still streaming with all\nthe images but that streaming does not lead to stress at the mental level, and does not lead to discomfort with the nature of what is there.\n\nWhen you are living out who you really are, you are not covered with all the mental activity of all the things you should not be; which is impossible for you to make sense out of because it is not what\nbelonged to you in the first place. This gate carries with it everything that you experienced from the past, and all of that is coming back to you, streaming back to you.\n\nAbove the lines it says: Transition, like birth, requires a determined strength for the passage through.\nJiirgen made the allusion to the midwife in the 53/42. I have worked with many midwifes who have this channel. Here in the pressure of the abstract from the mental plane, this birthing process is also there. It is\nthere in its very language.\n\nIt requires a determined strength for the passage through. To make sense out of anything is quite a process because there is no logic. There is only time. The abstract mind is nothing but time: all that time past, all\nthose things that can be used to finally bring together some kind of sense, the realization that can wait when there is contact with the 47th gate.\n\n64.1 Conditions\n\nPage 1\n\nSo we come to the first line, the line of introspection, the line which sets the foundation for the hexagram.\nIt is called Conditions. Remember that this is the pressure that will lead to historians and philosophers and idealists, to ideologies, to all of the things that are part of the abstract mental stream. It is all about\nconditions: to discover the condition itself in which the sequence takes place, in order to give it a framework to understand it.\n\nVenus exalted. In penetrating to the center, the understanding that instills the necessary harmony to survive disorder. In penetrating to the center does not say that it is guaranteed that you are getting to the\ncenter. It is about getting to the center. If you penetrate to the center, then you can survive the disorder.\nOtherwise, you can't.\n\nAmongst the confusion, the difficulty in finding the point. This is always the very basis of what it is to have abstract inspiration, that it is hard to find the point. Having difficulty in finding the point, you end up\nexploring many things. When you do get the point, which will not happen until you get to the other side, to the 47, you suddenly have this light bulb realization, \"Aha\". That is one side of it.\n\nThe other side is Mars in detriment. The powerful temptation, when having transition in sight, to hasty action. When you know where the point is, \"I have to get there now.\" An urge to act when you think you\nhave made sense of the confusion. These are the two basic sides of what happens to the abstract being. On one side, the abstract being is saying, \"I am very confused. I am going from crisis to crisis and from\nchange to change, and I cannot make sense out of my life. On the other side is the abstract being who says, \"Aha, this must be it. And if this must be it, I'll try it.\" Those are the two sides as the foundation of\nwhat it is to be inspired abstractly. They are driven, in the detriment sense, to try to act out what they come to believe makes sense. They can't know because the 64 is only a pressure which is not aware. The\nawareness is in the ajna.\n\n64.2 Qualification\n\nWte come to the second line, to projection. What is being projected out here is confusion. Somebody who has this line is projecting out, \"I am confused\".\n\nVenus exalted again. Venus is three times exalted and one time in detriment in the 64. An inner development which recognizes what qualities are essential for transcendence and the awareness that\nwithout them, action will fail. Action' here also means the activity of the mind; do not confuse this with doing. The action is all related to the activity that is in the description of the channel. It is the design of\nmental activity. It is mental action.\n\nIn the white book: Inner development that can end the confusion over what makes sense. Venus, collective gate. They are projecting out that they are confused. Guess what they get. They get all kinds of\npeople that want to help them out of their confusion. They get all kinds of people that say to them, \"Yes, I know why you are confused.\" That is why they get to learn this because they are projecting out that they\nare confused. They may not be, by the way. That is simply what is being projected out, and then they get all these people who come to them and say, \"Oh, I feel terrible for you. Let me show you how this works.\nLet me explain this to you. Let me give you an idea.\" Most of time it is, \"Read this book\" or, \"Go to see this therapist.\"\n\nMoon in detriment. Constantly in action, it wastes the very qualities and resources that it will need. The\nMoon is mentioned three times in this gate. It brings a lot of drive. Getting lost in confusion and burdening the psyche. When you are projecting out that you are confused, you may not even know why\nthere is confusion for you, or what it is. You can literally end up being lost in being confused. One of the things that I always tell people that have the 64th gate, and that is so important for them to understand, is\n\nPage 2\n\nthat the 64th gate, of all these mental gates with their theme of not being the authority in your life, this gate is truly for others. What you remember about yourself in any situation is automatically a lie. It has\nbeen censored already. What you remember about yourself in any situation (remember that all of that is truly about Conditions) is a lie and always will be. What you remember about others in the same situation\nis of enormous value to them and none to you. Any 64 that can accept that in their life is never going to be burdened in that process. That is the whole thing for them. The moment you are trying to make sense out\nof your own life through the 64th gate, welcome to hell. That is what you get.\n\n64.3 Overextension\n\nWhen we get to the third line, we get to the line called Overextension. This line is about trial and error.\nWe saw in the format energies that the third line is going to bump into the other side. It is not ready for it.\nIt is not equipped, as is the upper trigram. Because the third line is the completion of the lower trigram, it always bumps into what it is not prepared for. That's why it is trial and error.\n\nSaturn exalted. The wisdom to recognize when one has not the necessary resources... (you cannot make sense out of it) ... to complete transition. Such timely awareness may give it a chance to seek assistance.\nIn that moment, the other is there. In other words, one of the realities of the abstract and logical collective experience is that it is dependent on being shared with others, in order to really achieve its fulfillment.\n\nIn the white book: The wisdom to accept confusion as a temporary state that will be resolved in time or through others. That is a trial and error process. They are confused because the 64 is a confusing gate.\nThey will go through the trial and error of others being able to assist them in that, being able to work with them or it will simply come out of a transit.\n\nMoon in detriment. The risk of a superficially confident personality that when transition collapses, there is no one to turn to. Overconfidence that the fates will be kind on demand. In other words, \"I don't need\nyou to help me with my confusion because I have already learned through my trial and error that you can't make sense out of the world for me. I am going to wait for the gods to provide me with that moment of\nsatori.\" Whenever you meet 64.3's, these are people that are always waiting for that moment of enlightenment. Somewhere inside of them they know that it is possible.\n\n64.4 Conviction\n\nThe upper trigram and its theme of externalization. This line is called Conviction. This is a very fixed force. It has the Moon exalted. Symbolized by its phases, the Moon is assured of transition, convinced by\nits very process that it will triumph. Every person that has the 64th gate will always get the 47. They will get it from transits and people. Because the fourth line is fixed in being there in that process of confusion,\nit also recognizes that regularly that confusion always seems to come to some kind of realization. Those with this lunar aspect are people who start off very confused in something, and then go through a process\nwhere that confusion slowly dissipates. Suddenly the 47 is there, and then there is the opportunity for realization.\n\nOn the other side, we have the Mars in detriment. Where force and energy alone cannot overcome doubt.\nNo matter how many times the 64.4 gets to realize its way out of a confusion, when the confusion starts in its next cycle they are still doubtful that they will be able to get to the realization. The exalted learns that\nlesson and says, \"Okay. Ultimately, I will realize.\" In the detriment: No matter how many times they get to realize, there is always this mental anxiety that is generated that they are not able to realize themselves\nout of the next confusion they are dealing with.\n\n64.5 Promise\n\nPage 3\n\nWhen you come to the fifth line, the way in which this gate of confusion is projected on by others is that it represents a great promise. When everybody comes into contact with this 64.5, what they are projecting\non them is: If the confusion exists and they are active in the confusion, at some point, out of that is going to come realization - an idea and stimulation. In other words, what is projected on them is that they will\nsomehow come out of that confusion. They may, or may not.\n\nVenus exalted here, like in the fourth line. The fourth line is already dealing with the other side. That is why it can know that realization can come. It knows that there is something at the other side of the\nchannel. Here in this fifth line is the deep recognition that there is the 47 over there and what it is all about is not whether or not the realization is going to happen. It is whether or not there are the right\nhuman beings involved in that process, because it is collective. The 64.5 by itself knows that it is going to need the 47, the 1 1 and the 56. Otherwise, they will never see how this all comes out.\n\nThis line is about Promise. The promise is that it can manifest in the end as stimulation. The values promised in any new order... (the new order is a reference to the process from confusion to realization)\n...are demonstrated through harmonic interaction with others. This strengthens the justification for the struggle. The struggle to bring realization into manifestation as stimulation. The struggle not only to make\nsense out of something, but of making sense out of it to come up with an idea which is stimulating to others. \"This is my idea about what happened yesterday.\" To get to that point that the confusion can\nfinally be clearly discussed.\n\nConfusion over which values and relationships can bring harmony. The harmony for a 64 is only going to come when they hear it articulated out of the 56's voice \"I believe\". So, they need others. We are dealing\nwith a collective process here.\n\nOn the other side, Jupiter in detriment. A tendency in trying to justify the struggle by focusing exclusively on the failure of the old order that cannot demonstrate the quality of the new. What happens to these\npeople is that they stay stuck in the confusion because as long as they are just the 64, there is no pathway to the stream to the 56. It is not there. They do not hear it come out. As long as they don't hear it come\nout, even though they may be able to have somebody that can realize it, it does not mean that it is coming out. Until it comes out, they are still stuck in the old confusion. They have not been able to go beyond it.\nAll that is about people. It is deeply people oriented. This inspiration is for others and, by inspiring others, the nature of what one is inspiring can come out and be revealed. It is all about others. It is very\ncollective.\n\n64.6 Victory\n\nThis line is called Victory. Mercury exalted. The mental assuredness that knew that victory... (to make sense, to realize) ...was inevitable, thus making triumph sweet... (you know that the annoyance of being\nconfused will always have this sweetness of realization) ...but not reason for excess. The mental gift of enjoying the confusion and its diversity of data. This is really the magic that is possible with the 64.6.\nThat stream of information from the past will always come through. One can just enjoy the images, the stream for what they are. Nothing more and nothing less. It is not up to the 64 to make sense out of it. It is\nup to the 64 to inspire making sense out of it.\n\nThe moment that the 64 lets go of being responsible for the realization, it can enjoy its confusion because it is beautiful. It is history. It is the past. There are all the rich things that go through us experientially. It is\nthe great dreaming gate. You can't do much with your dreams. It is better not to do anything with them.\nLet them just go through, see them, and watch them.\n\nPage 4\n\nOn the other side, we have Venus in detriment, only one of the four lines where Venus is not exalted.\nLike the story of the Trojan horse, it can be dangerous to get carried away in celebration, lest one loses vigilance and perspective. In the white book: With all that data, it's easy to lose perspective. In other\nwords, enjoy the stream going through but if you get stuck only in the enjoyment of the stream, you don't get to see the pleasure of the realization of that inspiration. You just get stuck in the confusion and love it.\nI know people with this line who have actually said to me, \"Don't try to make sense out of the world for me. I like being confused.\" They will withdraw from all of this. They are sixth lines, after all. The sixth\nline is always ready not to fulfill everybody else's expectation about what that is supposed to be.\n\nWhen you meet a 64.6, you do not meet somebody who will give you the impression that they are confused. The actual impression that you get from them is that they know something you don't. This is the\nCheshire smile. It is a very sneaky smile. You have no idea. They may in fact remember something that they experienced with you that gives them that sense of that they know something that you don't. It is\nalways there. They are standing back. When the 64 reveals their dreams to others, others can form dream symbols, not they themselves. They can inspire others to realize out of their dreams.\n\nPage 5",

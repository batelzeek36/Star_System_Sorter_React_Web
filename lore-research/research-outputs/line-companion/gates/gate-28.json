  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 28 PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT\n\nHere, we move to the individual process and we stay with awareness as potential. Rather than taking you through the natural stream of all of these potential gates, that is, rather than going from the 32 to the 44,\nwhich I leave to you in your own process, I want to show you the harmonies that exist, not simply line for line throughout but to recognize that all three of these potentials (the 32, the 28 and the 1 8) are doing the\nsame job. They are just doing it differently. We have looked at the instinctive potential in the 32. Now we come to the channel 28/38, to the channel of Struggle, to a design of Stubbornness.\n\nWte come to the 28th gate, The Preponderance of the Great, the gate of the game Player. The potential is the awareness to struggle, or not. Individuality is acoustic, so it is literally the ability to respond\nacoustically and, in that response, we have the awareness whether to struggle or not. Not the awareness to transform or not. Because this is spontaneous, it is taking place existentially, in the now. The awareness\npotential is the stubbornness to listen, to make sure that one listens so that one can take the best possible risks.\n\nThis is all about risk taking. The 28th gate represents a primal fear in us: the fear of death. That fear is to be understood as a fear of whether or not life is of value. Just as the 32 is afraid that their work in this life\nwill be a failure, the 28 is afraid that their way in this life will be a failure, that is, that they themselves, their lives and what they live for is not really worthwhile. This is one of the deepest themes of\nindividuality: to see whether life is really of value or not, and this is rooted here in the 28th gate.\n\nIn the heading of the 32nd gate we find that the only thing which endures is change. When we come to the heading of the 28th hexagram, it says: The transitoriness of power and influence. It is the same thing. It is\nall about change and evolution. It is an ongoing process. The transitoriness of power and influence is what the Preponderance of the Great is all about.\n\n28.1 Preparation\n\nWe know that the nature of the first line is introspective. It is looking inward and the first line in the 28 is called Preparation. The desire to be effective manifested in the application of energy to detail. If you look\nat the 32.1, it says: A life sustaining respect and attention to all aspects of a process. We are talking about the same process; the only thing is that this is individual. The change that has to be endured in the 32 is\ntribal. It is all about support. It is all about the tribe.\n\nThis is an individual process where we have Venus in detriment. The aesthetic appreciation of planning that may have no real application. In other words, wonderful detail but nowhere to go. The intuition to\npotentially apply energy to detail; or An intuition for detail without the potential for application. It is all about being prepared.\n\nThis is the gate of game player and the risk taker. The first line has to set the foundation for that. What kind of risk do you want to take? You'd better have your detail. What often happens is that what looks\nlike a detriment isn't one at all. What that means is that you go through all the detail and then you don't take the risk due to what you see. It was just interesting to go through all the detail. This is all about\npreparation. Make sure that you have the detail before you take the risk. That is what the Preponderance of the Great is all about. The foundation is: you better have the detail. Which means, as you move\nthrough, the detail is always there. Risk taking is not a blind thing.\n\n28.2 Shaking hands with the Devil\n\nPage 1\n\nThe first line is trying to figure out the odds in introspection. The second line only wants to win and does not care what the odds are. Shaking hands with the devil: you are only interested in winning. When you\nlook at initiation which is part of the individual process, this deep competitiveness that lies within the individual nature is mirrored in this second line: the projection that \"I have to win. If I do not win and if I\ncan't take a risk and gamble, life is not worthwhile.\" This can lead to depression. This line is about\nDistasteful alliance.\n\nSun exalted. A means, however unsavory, that is justified by is end. Jupiter in detriment. The anxiety engendered by sacrificing higher principles when there is no guarantee of success. In the white book:\nWhen the game turns to a struggle, the intuitive acceptance of any alliance in order to win. The other side:\nThe risk in sacrificing principles when there is no guarantee of victory.\n\nThe whole nature of struggle is all about winning and losing. There are people that are either very good winners or very bad losers, or the other way around. All of that can lead them to be very uncomfortable\nwith themselves. Remember, the deep fear which lies underneath, this fear of whether life is really of value or not. These people will risk anything to get what they think is the projected victory. Realize the\nillusion of that. They are projecting, \"If I win this, life will be great.\" Then they discover that they have sold their soul to the devil. By the way, for them it is okay. You have to see that. If you have the second\nline, that is what it is about for you.\n\nAnybody with this second line has to recognize that they do not have all the details. Therefore, the winning and losing is important to them for their learning process. This is the child that has to learn, \"You\nhave to be a good loser. Do not get angry just because you have lost.\" This is a process that they have to go through because the detail is not there and they are just projecting it out.\n\n28.3 Adventurism\n\nWe reach the end of the lower trigram process and find the capacity to adapt. Details are available: the details are always necessary for the risk taker to know what to struggle about because not everything is\nworth winning. This is what the second line does not know. The third line knows that not everything is worth winning and not everything can be won, but it is Adventurism. This is the first attempt to really be\nable to fulfill the whole struggle to go across the channel.\n\nUnfounded risk taking. Saturn exalted. A basic conservatism that even in its adventurous acts is necessarily prudent. In other words, there is a carefulness built into the third line. It is not so quick to just\nproject outwards. It is not just waiting and adding up all the odds and ends and the detail.\n\nThe Jupiterian side: Here a perverse manriestation of Jupiter's expansiveness, where risk.taking is rationalized and failure ensurred. Without prudence, without relpedting the detail side (the projecting\ncapacity is there), there is always going to be failure. Failure in this context means that even if you win, it won't make life seem more worthwhile. That is the failure here.\n\nIn the white book: An intuitive caution in risk-taking in times of struggle, or Intuitive rationalizing of risk taking in times of struggle. One cannot just simply jump in because you ado not know what you will get,\nand you do not (know whether iit is worthwhile for you. This is the lesson that the three has to learn from the two.\n\nThe whole thing for the 28th agate is that the moment-they see that what'they are: struggling for is worthvvlhiie,, this is their whole story. If it is really -worthwhile for them, it its a wonderful process no\nmatter how hard tie struggle is to get there (because it is justified in the end. They get a sweet victory, inot -the sour victory of taking -a risk because What -you are trying to win in this game is not the prime. It is\nthe sense of accomplishment, that to be individual in this (life is really worthwJhile. \"It is great to The\n\nPage 2\n\nalive. It its nice to be a human being. I enjoy my life.\" That is the real victory that is being sought out here.\n\n28.4 Holding on\n\nWith the fourth line we reach the upper trigram. The 28.4 is a very unusual line as it is part of the cross of\nThe Unexpected, and therefore, very unexpected things come out of this line. All fourth lines, due to their nature of externalization and due to their one-trackedness, are very focused on one aspect.\n\nHere it is called: Holding on. The ability through whatever means to keep one's grip. These people hold on to their struggle and nothing can pull them from that. They are very one-track in their struggle. No\nmatter what the struggle is, no matter what they have to go through in their drive to externalize, they can really hold it together.\n\nJupiter exalted. The application of knowledge to exploit opportunities, and usually for the greater good.\nThe Mercurial side: The application of intelligence to hold on, exclusively out of self-interest. That is being individual in the first place. That is hardly a detriment in the normal sense of the word because that\nis the individual process.\n\nA depth of intuition at its best in struggle and often of value to others. If I want somebody who will help me in a struggle with someone or about something, I will look for a 28.4. They are very good at that. This\nis their nature. They can really be in there and get into that energy.\n\nA depth of intuition that is stubbornly selfish in its capacity to hold on. They will not work with me. They are in their own thing. They have to deal with their struggle. The people with the 28.4 can be infuriating if\nyou do not understand their nature because they get fixed and obsessed with their particular struggle. It has to do with a certain thing for them. Everything about the 28, in the end, is about winning, like\neverything about the 32 has to do with succeeding (\"Do not fail.\").\n\nHere you have to win, but the winning is about winning for yourself in the sense that your life is worthwhile. It is hard to kill these people. There is a deep focus here on holding on in the struggle until\ntheir very last breath in order to figure out, \"Yes, it was worthwhile.\" Then they get the joke and die. The joke is that the game is fixed.\n\n28.5 Treachery\n\nThe universalization line of the 28 is called Treachery. It has a wicked name but it is not wicked at all.\nTheir job is to universalize struggle. Their job is to get everybody to struggle for the value of life. At the highest level, if you look at the highest principles, that is what these people do. They get other people to\nstruggle in order to find out for themselves that life is worthwhile. They provoke them in that sense.\n\nThe abuse of trust. The manipulation of the collective that, while pitting one faction against the other, does not directly support or reject either. This is not about winning or losing. This is about making sure\nthat everybody is in the game. Please understand that. That is very important. This is a universalizing element about dealing with the fear of death. They deal with this fear by getting everybody in the game to\nstruggle about whether life is worthwhile. Somebody with the 28.5 probes somebody else with, \"Is your life really worthwhile? Are you really doing what you want to do?\" They get them all cranked up. They,\nthemselves, do not care. They just want everybody to play the game. They want everybody to be in the same struggle. They are hoping at least if they get it, maybe I'll get it too.\n\nPage 3\n\nThe other side is classic: Sun in detriment. The breaking of alliances with trusted forces to align with more powerful forces, and the attendant destabilization of the whole. This is what they are best at. For\nexample, they go to Osho and come back and say, \"Oh, my Master is full of light.\" Then somebody tells them about another master and they will join that one. They stop being a sannyasin. They keep on\nchanging their masters. Every time that they leave, the people they leave are saying, \"Treachery. These are bad people who can't be trusted.\" This is not true. For this line, the struggle is endless. If you have\nstruggle in life, you will have it until you die.\n\nThese people recognize that it is an ongoing process. They surrender to it in that sense. They have one teacher and they think that he is wonderful and when somebody tells them that there is a better teacher,\nthat is where they go because they are trying to get to the point where they find something that really shows them that life is worthwhile, and they will continue to take that risk. They leave behind a lot of\nstruggle. The person that they leave behind who was depending on them says, \"Why did they go?\" They have the struggle now. \"Is life really worthwhile because they are gone?\" This is what they do. They are\ngreat disturbers. They just move this out into the world. Everybody struggles together.\n\n28.6 Blaze of Glory\n\nWe come to the roof of the house and we come to Blaze of Glory. Again, the thing to recognize about this sixth line is that is does not want to have anything to do with struggle. Nothing. It wants to get to the 44th\nhexagram, to the first line which is called: The establishment of frameworks as a result of interaction. It wants to establish a mastery over the collective. It wants to go to something else. It wants to go far\nbeyond the struggle. It can only go there if life is worthwhile.\n\nSacrifice rather than capitulation to the law of deterioration. No matter what it takes, I will not keep on sliding down in the hopelessness of not finding that life is worthwhile. I will start taking any kind of risk.\nI will make any kind of sacrifice. I will stop eating until I die, just to see if it is worthwhile.\n\nPluto exalted. Regeneration and renewal no matter what the price. Neptune in detriment. Self-destruction.\nThat is something that had a deep impact on a whole generation of people. So many people were born with this configuration with either Pluto or Neptune. (1958-1960).\n\nIn the white book: The deep intuitive drive to win, no matter what the cost. The other side: The deep intuitive fear of defeat and a potentially profound hopelessness in times of struggle. Remember that the\nvictory and the loss have to do\n\nwith whether life is worthwhile. These people work too much, live too fast, drive too fast. They take a little too many drugs. They are always pushing it to see whether or not life can really be worthwhile.\nMany of them are pushed to the point of destruction. Literally, these people make themselves sick over a lifetime. They just slowly burn themselves out because they cannot find this sense that \"It is okay, life is\nworthwhile.\"\n\nThe 28 is only potential. V% have not looked at the possibility of awareness that comes out of that potential. The potential to find out whether life is worthwhile takes the 57th and the 20th gate to bring the\nawareness to the throat and manifest it in the now so that the 28.6 can see, \"Being here in the now, life IS.\nIt just is. I do not have to be afraid of it because it is there.\" If the 28.6 is hanging there by itself, it can be very uncomfortable because one does not want to struggle. One simply wants to know that life is\nworthwhile. These are people who, instead of struggling, just hurt themselves.\n\nPage 4",

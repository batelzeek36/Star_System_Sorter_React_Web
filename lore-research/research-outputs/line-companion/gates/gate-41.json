      "heading": "Reasonableness",
      "raw": "Remember, when you are looking at a hexagram, the first line is always going to represent not simply the foundation of the hexagram, but its essential truth. What is its basis?\n\nThe first line is Reasonableness. You can't have all of your fantasies because you will lose your power.\nYou must get one and then go on to the next. Reasonableness becomes the key. The appropriate delegation of responsibility. The first line is looking inward. It has no capacity to look outward. It is\ninterested in what the essential mechanism is. What is fantasy? That is the question that the first line always asks.\n\nWhen the first line of the 41 is a child, they want to know what the difference is between what is real and what is fantasy. They want to grasp that right away. What is fantasy? The appropriate delegation of\nresponsibility; it is the theme we have just been looking at.\n\nRemember that we are dealing with the root center, with the adrenaline hormone, the stress hormone. The root center carries with it enormous power. There is a tremendous fuel at work here. So, the appropriate\ndelegation of responsibility is how to use that energy. In other words, what fantasy, what feeling do you focus on? Don't get caught up in just seeing that fantasy. If you are somebody who is focusing on feeling\ngood about the day and feeling bad about your work and you are a Al. 1, you will be very uncomfortable.\nEither focus on the good feeling (that it is a nice day) or focus on feeling bad (because you are at work), but do not try to focus on both of them. It will not work for you. It will not be productive for you. It will\nnot be a healthy fueling of your potential.\n\nRemember the mirrors, the dualistic interplay in Design. The splenic system is our immune system. It is our protection from disease. We know that it is all about health. But recognize as well that there is illness\nthat strikes the solar plex system, this powerful motor emotional system: emotional illness, emotional unhealthiness, lack of balance, emotionally. When these fuels are properly recognized and you live out\ntheir nature, then the solar plex, the emotional system, benefits from that and it becomes healthier. It is getting a healthier fuel. These are pressures, and they carry with them a great deal of force. I would have\nused the word 'conditioning' but I do not want to confuse you. This power carries a great deal of force.\n\nThis line has Neptune exalted. The imagination to make the very best out of very little. You don't need to have all the feelings to get everything out of it. One focused feeling can take you all the way: always will,\nalways can. That Neptunian side tends to be people who are much more caught up in the fantasy of the\n\nPage 2\n\n41, the Neptunian quality of that. Anybody who has Neptune there has it veiled automatically. Think about that: the foundation is automatically veiled, so it can be very mysterious and it tends to be about\nfantasy on the non-manifesting side.\n\nThe Mercurial side: A tendency in understanding to assume capability, leading to strain. I always tell people with the 41 st gate: it is wonderful for you to have this feeling, this fantasy inside, but don't ever\nthink that there is more for you. Remember that everything about the abstract stream is about our process of expectations. If you do one step after the other, you assume that you will get somewhere because that is\nthe nature of the abstract process. The assumption of capability is when you look inside and you see you have this fantasy, you think that because you can fantasize it, you can do it. I can fantasize making love to\nMartians but I will not be able to do it. The reality is that for these people, this is often very difficult. You can see it in the white book. It talks about coolness and the hothead: the cool and hot of the pressure to\nfeel. This is the fundamental duality in fantasy: they are either cool or hot fantasies.\n\nCoolness, where the energy to release feelings is selective. In other words, one is clear about one feeling at a time. By the way, these feelings can come very quickly but as long as they are one at a time, it is\nokay. The hothead, the urge to release feelings. What happens to these people is that they can get into a great deal of trouble in life because they have within them this need to feel out what is essentially nothing\nmore than a fantasy, with very little odds of realizing it.\n\nRemember that only the fourth to the sixth lines really have the skills to integrate with the energy on the other side. The first line is simply there to look into the nature of the feeling, of the fantasy, but the\nmoment it is trying to live that out, it will get a lot of crises. If they are truly emotional people, they will enjoy their crises anyway. The 41st gate is a potential to release your own feelings and it is also a\npotential to condition the release of feelings in others.\n\nThe 41st hexagram is a nice meditation. You have to see that we have six steps in our evolutionary process, and we are not at the sixth line yet. Wie will all have very interesting experiences as a collective\n(not necessarily individually) with the movement of Neptune and Uranus reaching 41.6. It is an evolutionary process. We have gone as far as the fifth line. So, when you are looking at this process, the\nfirst thing to recognize about the very first step is that human evolution was rooted in focus on the feeling, and then you get the experience. That is how you learn. If you are sitting there and you have a zillion\nfeelings, you do not move. There is no way to go. The very first thing that distinguished us was the capacity to have a feeling, the fantasy to focus on that and to hold that focus until the potential, the 30th\ngate at the other end, to begin a process of actually manifesting that as experience was there."

      "heading": "Caution",
      "raw": "When you come to the second line, you are no longer in the foundation. Now you have this deep genetic need to project the quality of the gate outwards: \"Here I am with the fuel to feel.\" In projecting it\noutwards, you have the word Caution. Humanism tempered by pragmatism. The evolutionary process begins in the individual, in the single being. The next step is that it has to become something broader than\nthat: collective.\n\nThe two sides of this are Saturn and Mars. A conservative nature that does not risk its own security in aiding others. You can fantasize how you can help somebody and you can then go and focus on that and\ndo it. You can fantasize on helping somebody and not be able to manifest that at all. You can have a feeling for starving children in Biafra and not send any coins. These things are all built into the Saturnian\nline.\n\nPage 3\n\nIn the white book: Energy for one's own feelings but not for others. To focus on one's own feelings, one's own fantasies, and not on the feelings of others or whatever their requirements happen to be.\n\nThe Martian side is The energy for the display of feelings for recognition. This is trying to get others to recognize that one is a feeling person. Remember that the second line is projecting outward.\n\nA desire for recognition that throws caution to the winds, depleting valuable resources for only temporary gain. This stream is about desire for change, for experience and about the desire to fulfill one's fantasies.\nIt is the expectation that if one has a fantasy and fulfills it, one is going to get something. The second line is projecting outwards that they have this resource inside of them.\n\nRemember the immaturity of Mars. Immaturity is not a question of good or bad. The immature 41.2, projecting out that they have the feeling that somebody hooks into, may discover that they are terribly\nequipped for that and it can end up being a crisis because they can be a paper tiger. The fact is that they are projecting something out and do not have the quality of the first line. They do not have this\nfoundation. On the Martian side, they put all the energy into projecting it out. They want people to connect to their feeling. They want to be able to get their fantasy to the next step. This can present all\nkinds of difficulties for them.\n\nThere is something else about this: already in this second line, which is very rare, there is a need for others. This is the most sexual of all the streams and there is no way that the human experience was going\nto be allowed to be individual. It wasn't. They are collective and, as such, early (in the second line, a line that is titled Humanism) there is a need to display this feeling for others to fulfill the feeling, the fantasy,\nthe collective process of not having the experience by yourself, but sharing the experience with somebody else. The second line is not equipped. It is Mars; it is immature and it has its problems with that. The\nexalted line, the Saturnian field, is more secure in that role."

      "heading": "Efficiency",
      "raw": "One of the dilemmas of the collective process is that somebody always starts it. So, in that essence, there is always an individual, a single being, that starts to change events. When you are looking at the whole\nevolutionary process here, you will see in the dualities of the lines that the exalted tend to point towards doing things by oneself, whereas the detriment says, \"No, we have to involve everybody else.\" The third\nline is classic of this. Remember that the third line is completing a process. It has qualities of the first and second line. It has completed the process in the sense that it is, within itself, ready to experiment.\n\nThe third line is about trial and error, bonds made and broken. It is about this learning process which is called Efficiency here. In times of decrease selfishness is justified. In that moment of your feeling, what it\nis saying is: release your energy into that feeling and you will discover whether that is a mistake or not.\nWait and see. But release all of your energy into that feeling. That is efficient.\n\nRemember that the adrenaline system, if it is defined in somebody, must be used. This energy must be worked. It is absolutely essential. When that energy is being used properly, that is what efficiency is all\nabout. Because it is a. third line, it means that you are not instantly efficient. It means that you have to learn how to be efficient, when to release energy into a fantasy, when to release energy into a feeling.\nThis is not about an awareness that tells you when. It is about a process that, if you don't do it right, it does not work and you learn from that experience and you try to do it differently the next time, as a result\nof that learning experience.\n\nSaturn exalted. Material ambition and the discipline to go at it alone; and The energy that fuels the feeling for personal ambition. Very much oriented towards someone's rather than the collective's experience. \"I\n\nPage 4\n\nwill see how that mushroom tastes. That is my fantasy. I want to feel what that is like. I want to have that experience.\" If the person drops dead after eating the mushroom, nobody else will do it. But if that person\nhas a wonderful trip and sees God and they tell their collective friends, \"Hey, I just saw God. All you have to do is to eat one of these,\" then it can become a collective experience, a collective feeling. What\nthis line is saying is that efficiency is to put your energy into your feeling and your fantasy.\n\nWhen you come to the other side, you have the Moon in detriment. I have my design Moon in this line. I know it well.\n\nInstinctive assistance, admirable but in this position misguided, where two will use up resources more than twice as fast as one. The energy that fuels the feeling to share. I am very individual. This is the only\npart of me that really is designed to give anything to anybody at any time. One of the jokes in my life is that my son has Saturn in the 41.3. He is always in my pocket. He is the selfish one and I have to share.\nThis feeling that one has to share: now, it is a detriment. Think of the jokes.\n\nThis whole stream is about the human experience and though each of these early lines are geared towards making sure that the evolutionary process goes on, somebody has to take the first step to go across the\nmountain. There is going to be this force underneath that says, \"Yes, but I have to take somebody with me in order to share the experience with me because otherwise, we do not have a humanity. \"V just have a\nkind of a bizarre species but we don't have what will become a strictly human phenomenon, something that we call culture. No culture, no civilization until we share our experiences. By the way, I have an\nundefined root center and my 41.3 is unconscious, so I do not trust that process. It is always conditioned by others."

    "4": {
      "heading": "Correction",
      "raw": "When we get to the upper trigram, we get to a different kind of process because the fourth and fifth lines are oriented towards the other end of the channel. They recognize the potential at the other side through\ndefinition. By their very nature, the fourth and fifth lines are the social lines because it is inherent in their genetic capacity to integrate and to look across the channel for the definition.\n\nHere, we are dealing with a very collective stream, with an experiential stream, a sexual stream. That means we are dealing with very powerful forces. The moment you come to the fourth line, you come to\nthe fixedness of a fourth line. Fourth lines are unidirectional. They are fixed. The first thing we can recognize about that is that, given the nature of this gate, this is a very appropriate line. Decrease is\ndesigned to operate with one feeling at a time, with one fantasy you are focused on at a time. So, this unidirectional capacity in the fourth line is of value. You are focused and fixed on your feeling. You are\nholding back all of this fuel, waiting for the moment that the potential is there because you can recognize that when the potential is there, you can get that energy across, focused on it.\n\nWhat often happens is that 41.4's get locked into being fixed on one feeling, one fantasy, and can be fixed on a certain feeling or fantasy for a very long time, even throughout their whole life because it is this\nfixedness that is there. But there is a great advantage in that fixedness.\n\nThe line is called Correction. Successful adaptation to limitation. The limitation is, \"I am a fuel. I am not a potential.\" The limitation is very basic. In this line, the Earth is exalted. When we have the Earth\nexalted, you recognize that it is part of a regular cycle of the Earth. It is something that is going to happen twice a year. It is a very strong grounding force in that sense. Out of the Earth, we get our basic security.\n\nHere, we have a classic line. Survival of the fittest-in the Darwinian concept-and its eventual flourishing.\nThe fixedness of humanity on a feeling, on a fantasy, guaranteed that it would be the top of the food\n\nPage 5\n\nchain. We are to be at the top of the food chain. The survival of the fittest is our movement. The survival of the fittest is the perfection that comes out of being unidirectional in one's fantasy and feeling, to get\nthere finally, to be able to fly, to be able to go to space, to do whatever the case may be and to be fixed on that.\n\nThe Venusian side: The expenditure of energy on maintaining relationships rather than on correction. It immediately goes back into the powerful relationship field. In times of decrease, weak associations are\nshunned as costly, no matter how attractive. The survival of the fittest is that you are always in the process that you are fixed on but you have to adapt along the way. Otherwise, you will never get to your\ngoal.\n\nHere, the focus is different. The focus is pulled out to the other. Remember that the fourth and fifth lines will always go across. By being pulled out to the other, it loses its fixedness, but it maintains the\nrelationships. That is the other side of it. You have the fantasy that you want to be able to do something in a certain way and the people that you are with do not want to do it that way. They want to do something\nthat is similar, but their way. You do not want to lose them so you go along with that. Thus, you lose that fixedness which is very important. These people can end up being very frustrated because they don't get\nto live out this experience.\n\nAbout 50,000 years ago, we got to the point of this line. It was probably around the same time that we began to have relationships with animals in which we could not simply kill them but control them."

    "5": {
      "heading": "Authorization",
      "raw": "The first line always gives you the essential truth of the hexagram, but the fifth line is always how it is perceived by the world around us. We know that when we are dealing with the structure of a hexagram,\nwe are dealing with a resonance within a hexagram, the music within a hexagram. The first line is in resonance with the fourth line, the second with the fifth, and the third with the sixth. The foundation of\nknowing what a fantasy is leads to being able to externalize that fantasy and being fixed on getting that feeling out. In the second line, we saw the capacity to project out this fuel, this pressure within you, this\nresource for all these feelings and fantasies within you. When we get to the fifth line, we come to somebody who automatically is going to have projected on them that they have this resource, that they\nhave the feeling and the fantasy. \"1 know that person will go along with me. I know that they have the same feeling I have.\" This is projected onto that person. They may or may not.\n\nThis fifth line is called Authorization. Think about this in evolutionary terms. This is the stage of our evolutionary process that we are in now. We have given authority (we have projected authority) onto this\nessential process of experience. From the moment that we entered into this stage of our development, we have had more experiences than we could ever possibly have imagined earlier. The 20th century is full of\nmore human experiences than have ever existed in the whole history of the planet up until now. We have given authority to the experiential way. This is what it is to be human. Vas go after this and that, and we\ngo to Mars and the stars, etc., until we finally shake hands with God.\n\nAuthorization. The external recognition of one's potential despite limitations. Think about the nature of what it is to have any root gate that has no natural outlet. You have this powerful motor with all this\nessential fuel, all this essential resource material waiting for that opportunity, waiting within the limitation of only being fuel. Do not attribute awareness to any of these gates. They are not aware; they are fuels.\nThat fuel is not a potential. The 30 is the potential, the 36 is the possibility and the manifestation does not come until you get all the way up to the Progress in the throat. There is a lot of limitation in just having\nthe fantasy or the resource of the feeling. You may never get them out.\n\nPage 6\n\nThink about the 41.5. They have a greater chance to release their feelings and fantasies than anybody else on Earth because everybody else is ready to project on them that they have a feeling and a fantasy. So,\nthese people are always at risk because they can end up just firing rockets. Everybody comes up to them and says, \"Aha. I know that you want to do this with me. Let me provide you with the potential, okay?\"\n\nMars exalted. That tells you something right away. Whenever you see Mars exalted you know that this is all about just let it go.' The value of energy when properly channeled. There are people in America who\nasked me if this was a channeling line. The answer is yes. It is written here. Properly channeled energy is the whole thing. 'Channeling' in English means to allow the energy to flow properly. The moment that\nsomebody comes up to you and recognizes your capacity to feel or to have a fantasy and they offer you that opportunity, they can do exactly what this gate is all about. You can focus on releasing that feeling or\nfantasy and getting it out. The immature Mars means to get the feeling out right away, and then it is over.\nThat is the limitation.\n\nThe fuel for properly channeled feelings despite limitations. These people are always being projected upon. They are always given these opportunities. These people are not well. Remember that about them.\nThey can be but, like all things that have to do with powerful energies that are not part of an awareness, given the nature of how human beings see themselves, this can present a great many problems because\neverybody is projecting on these people, \"You feel for me. Your fantasy and my fantasy are one.\" They are constantly having people project on them, constantly pulling out that fuel at the same time. So, these\npeople can go through a roller coaster of feelings and fantasies. They get burdened by crisis in their process.\n\nVenus in detriment. Look at the fourth line and the fifth lines which are the only social lines. We have a collective stream and we know that it is deeply social. It is about the development of humanity, and\nVenus rules the world. It rules our planet. Venus is in charge of our morals and is responsible for establishing, within the human environment, within the human community, what is right and wrong. It\nestablishes our basic values which then get translated into our cultural styles, our interrelationships with each other. And yet, in both of these lines, Venus is in detriment. Because the moment that you are\ndealing with fantasy and feeling and its complete capacity, whatever Venus thinks is right, it will look for some wrong and whatever Venus sees that is wrong, the stream will look for something else anyway. In\nother words, the basic values always get broken in this process. They have to because everything needs to be experienced. The moment you have a good guy, you have a bad guy.\n\nLimitations initiate the fuel for negative feelings. Think about what that is like for a 41.5, when somebody comes up to them and says, \"I am deaf, dumb and blind. Could you give me three bucks?\" It is very\ndifficult for them not to give the energy and, after a while, they get very dissatisfied with other human beings feeding on their fuel. After all, the capacity of the five is that it is at the end of the hexagram\nprocess. The six is beyond that. It knows the game. When I say 'know', I mean this in the genetic sense. It is built into it. It knows that one feeling at a time is correct and it has to be its feeling. It is great to share it\nbut it has to be its own feeling, not simply yanked out by everyone.\n\nWherever you see a fifth line, you have the theme of being victimized, used by others, in that sense, because they can so easily project onto you that you have that inherent capacity. The nature of the fifth\nline is always this balance on either side. That is, to have others project on you is a great value and a great opportunity. These people do get the opportunity to experience so many feelings and fantasies in their\nlives because others will project on them and give them that opportunity to release it. But at the same time, so many of those opportunities to experience are not really for them to experience. It is simply\nbecause it is so easy to hook into that energy and pull it out. If you have the line and you are aware of the mechanism, it is not that you can change the impact of somebody hooking into it but, by being aware of\n\nPage 7\n\nwhat is happening, it is much less attractive to be pulled out of your limitation. This is the whole thing about having energy.\n\nI have a defined ego. I will offer my willpower sometimes to others, but not always. Before I became aware of that energy, I was always empowering everybody around me with my will. I do not do that\nanymore. It is not something that I trained myself. It is a byproduct of being aware of your own nature. It is one of those things that come with the recognition of mechanics.\n\nThe other thing that we always have as a footnote to any of these discussions is that any of these aspects, any of these lines, can only be seen in the context of somebody's design. How those things are going to\noperate and how they will function is always dependent on the nature of somebody's design. For so many people that will have the same line, it is a different configuration. You have 41.5's that are connected to\nthe Sacral and it is always generating, but it is only really correct for them when they are responding, so they have different rules.\n\nYou have manifestors with the 41.5, where the energy might go through the spleen and go up to the throat and they can always manifest this energy. You have people who have undefined root centers, or you have\n41.5's connected to the 30, not connected to the sacral or the throat. These people are called Projectors.\nWhat that means is that they have to be recognized by others; otherwise, they can never experience their process. Whatever the line is, it always ends up of being a matter of what kind of definition is there. It is\nalways the key to how the energy will ultimately come out in the life."

      "heading": "Contagion",
      "raw": "When you get to the sixth line, please keep in mind that we are looking at this 41st hexagram as a key to understand our human evolutionary process. When I say human evolutionary process, I do mean strictly\nthat. This time frame that we have, in which we are in these kinds of vehicles and functioning the way we do, we are at the stage of the fifth line, but we are not yet at the stage of the sixth line. We will first deal\nwith the mutation that will bring about the awakening of what we call emotional consciousness, or spirit consciousness. But there is something else that has to take place. One of the more mysterious things that\nthe Voice told me about our evolutionary process is that when the change comes, when we lose these vehicles and we go on to our next process, that this stream that starts in the 41 and goes all the way up,\nwill disappear. It will not exist anymore and this reality is built into this line.\n\nContagion. The law that the maximization of potential not only ends decrease (ends feeling, ends fantasy) but inevitably such transcendence benefits others.\n\nThink about how I describe what the nature of emotional or spirit consciousness is like. We have emotional waves that are being generated and, between those waves as they interact with each other, there\nis a field, an interactive field, a field where the consciousness actually will exist. We do not understand such a thing. It is not possible anyway to understand it in the logical sense of the word. This is something\nwhere our experience of consciousness will be outside of our individual bodies and will not be our own consciousness, but it will be a consciousness that we are sharing with somebody else, or a group of\npeople, or ultimately, a planetary field. Something that is in a slow developing process.\n\nWhen you get to the sixth line of a hexagram, you get to the roof of the house. You get to the end of the process. We know that we find the potential of wisdom in every sixth line and, therefore, it is less likely\nto function in the nature of what the hexagram is than any of the other lines. It says, \"What for?\" and \"Why should I? I want to see the whole thing.\" You cannot see the whole experiential field. It is not\npossible. The law is that the maximization of potential ends in decrease, ends this process of constantly needing another experience. This process of constantly going from one thing to the next will come to an\n\nPage 8\n\nend. But inevitably such transcendence (after all, it is transcendence we are talking about here) benefits others. At the moment that we are no longer looking for the new experience, we are all in one thing\ntogether, as long as there is not the drive within humanity that it has to be more.\n\nSaturn exalted. The maximization of the potential of form. The father (or the mother) whose success will benefit his children. It is very important to understand that the children of Homo sapiens, if you look at\nthis from the mystical side, will be something else. This transition out of the experiential way, its completion, will lead to the transcendence that not those who do transcend will experience. They will go\nthrough a period of discomfort, but what follows will benefit from all of that.\n\nBy the way, that has mundane applications as well, like all lines. The 41.6, when it can make a fuelling commitment to an energy, can ultimately benefit others through that and be of value. It is called\nContagion. They can lead all kinds of human beings into an experiential trend. These people can be trendsetters. But ultimately, the major trend, the ultimate trend, the mystical trend, is when we have a lack\nof experience: when the need for experience, the desire for experience, is left behind. That is when the process is complete. We are not there yet.\n\nPluto in detriment. The tendency in transcendence to keep it a secret in fear of being deprived of its special advantages. This is what we are going to experience in the next century. The way in which\nevolution works is that we will have pockets all over the planet of different kinds of creatures, like us, that have different capacities than we do, not in any science fiction sense of the word but simply in that they\nwill begin to experience each other, from the moment of birth, in a consciousness field that they will not be able to describe. In most cases, they will never share it with anybody else because it will seem rather\nbizarre. They will be the ones that are different in the way in which experience is initiated because they will stop it. You will have a generation of children who are born that will have the 41, 30, 36, 35 and they\nwould not appear to us to be abstract at all. They themselves will have a feeling of almost being stuck.\nThey will be the root of cults in the next century that will say that, not only is it all coming to an end, but they are already dying from it, that there is no place to go, that there is nowhere for humanity to go, that\nhumanity is going to die out. They will have a lot of confirmation of that because it will look like that. We will have a vast decrease in population.\n\nHere in the white book: The fuel for recognition through feelings; and The fuel for secret or repressed feelings. Be careful with the words 'repressed feelings'. Ultimately, that is what is going to take place, in\nthat sense. The first thing that will happen is that these feelings will be repressed. The need for experience, the need for fantasy will be repressed, not repressed in the unhealthy sense that we use this\nlanguage now, but simply because that is going to be the genetic capacity to start holding back this need for more experience.\n\nPlease understand that we are moving towards a time in which we need to be vastly organized, organized in the most intimate way. That organization comes out of the logical field which requires repetition and\nexperimentation, and not out of the abstract field. What will happen here is that the whole abstract field will begin to be repressed and if you meet a 41.6, you will see that if you ask them, \"Do you fantasize a\nlot?\" they say, \"No.\" \"Are you full of all these feelings?\" \"No.\" The mechanism is already at work and goes along with the sixth line quality of why should I? It is already at work.\n\nTransit: Uranus in 41.6\n\nThe Human Design System is a Uranian system, and wherever Uranus goes in the wheel is significant for humanity. Every 84 years, Uranus comes to the 41st gate. This time that Uranus is there, it is going to\ninitiate an 84 year cycle that will culminate with the beginning of this transition. It will take well over a thousand years for humanity to get to this sixth line. It will not happen tomorrow or in the next century.\n\nPage 9\n\nEvolution on the human scale is a very slow process. This emotional spirit consciousness has already been with us for thousands of years and yet, we did not have any tools to really be able to look at it until\nvery recently.\n\nIn the children that are born with Uranus in 41, particularly those who are born with Uranus in the 41.6, they will begin the pull43ack in this experiential way. They will be the first generation of abstract children\n(it is depending on the design) who do not seem to function that way. These children, in our time, over the next 20 years, will be clinically looked at as being repressed. \"No, my Johnny does not want to try to ride\na bicycle. I do not understand it. I can't get him on the bicycle. I think that he is afraid of bicycles.\" It is simply because this is beginning to work and Uranus is initiating this new experience, especially in the\nsixth line. Uranus will bring that out in the children, so that there is already this genetic field that is beginning to operate and the children who are born with the 41.6 will be alive deep into the next century.\nThey carry this energy with them and keep the aura of this energy alive in the world. They are setting the foundation for this transition.\n\nYou can see some of that now in what people call the AIDS epidemic. One of the things about the stream\n41 to 35 is that it is the most sexual of all the streams. It is literally rooted in sexuality for the experience and that experience can be anything. In that sense, you can already see that this repression of those things\nis something that will come very strongly.\n\nYou will have a reaction to this in the environment until all of the experiences, the feelings and desires that we acquaint with being human will slowly be repressed, be restricted, so that we can become more\nand more organized without constantly being dragged out of the organization by the need of the abstract person to have a different kind of feeling. \"You are designed to be an architect\". \"I know but I have this\nfeeling that I want to be an astronaut. \" The planet has to eliminate this other side that automatically pulls you to say, \"Yes, but wouldn't it be great if...?\"\n\nFor us, nothing that I am describing is particularly pleasant. For us, we are part of the aura of the fifth line where we give authority to experience. Without experience, you do not know. That is why we have virtual\nreality. Nobody gets the experience, vie already have vast movements at work to take us out of needing to physically have the experience ourselves, and yet, we have come into the world in a time where it still has\nits authority. We will have its authority for hundreds of years. There will be a great reaction to that. In your work over the next years, it is important to recognize that, as these children are coming on a stream,\nparticularly children that come with the 41.6, they cannot be pushed into the experiential way by their parents. They will become very ill because they are the first generation that is there not to get pulled into\nthat. They have to be aloof from it.\n\nThe experiential drive is coming to an end. The whole experiential nature of being human is coming to an end. In other words, we are at the flourishing of that. We are getting so many experiences. We are\ncollecting so much data. We will now go down the other side. Ever since Neptune left 61, we are going down the other side, the other slope. Everything is being reduced. We start to pull things back. We are not\ndriven into new experiences anymore. We are locked into old experiences, trying to stay alive and survive and flourish. We will not look for something new, but we will go back to the basics.\n\nThe deepest event in the next century will be that the fertility capacity in humans will be devastated. We have to go back to basic things and be very well organized in order to keep the species alive. We will not\nbe able to tolerate all kinds of drives for different experiences when the species itself is threatened. These are all mechanisms that will come into work in the next century.\n\nIt is like the project to Mars. They spend 256 million dollars to get it there. They are spending about 1 12 million dollars a day tracking it. When somebody comes along in the next century and says, \"Okay, now\n\nPage 10\n\nthat we have gone to Mars, why don't we go to Pluto?\" There will be people who say, \"Wait a minute.\nWhy? We could take all of this money and give it to starving children and poor people. \" We have to stay with the basics of what we need to have to be organized properly. It is not to say that we won't do things,\nbut the pragmatism of what it is to keep humanity alive will restrict the way we use resources. That is what the 41 is all about. It is wonderful to look at the pictures they took of Mars, but we come to the point\nwhere people reject that. Resources have to go back into our hands to increase our fertility.\n\nPage 11"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 41 DECREASE\n\nThe pressure centers are of enormous importance, like all things. We are basically a sandwich. You have a pressure above and a pressure below, and everything else is just squashed in the middle. Those\npressures rule the nature of the world that we live in. They fuel all of the basic potentials of what it is to be in a body, of what it is to live out the consciousness of being a human being. They are essential and\nthey are always present.\n\nWhen I say they are always present, that is not a matter of whether you have them personally in your design or not. As long as they are in the world, they are a part of the aura of the world and everybody gets\nin contact with them. So, in looking at these pressure centers, please understand that we are looking at the fundamental root of all human processes. In that, the fundamental source of pressure is necessary to\ninitiate all of these processes.\n\nI start with the 41st hexagram for a particular reason. We are living in a time in which the 41st hexagram is activated by outer planets so we are going to have a deep continuing experience with it. The 41 st\nhexagram is the fuel or the pressure of an abstract stream in the sensing circuit, the stream of feeling. This stream is a uniquely human stream. It is the evolutionary and genetic material necessary for us to\nexperience incarnation in a human form. Without this stream, the human evolutionary process would not exist. Not only are we speaking here of a fundamental pressure for a life process, but in particular, to\nunderstand it is not shared with any other form of life. This is a very specific pressure and a very specific stream that is directly associated with what we experience as being human.\n\nThe 41st hexagram, as a codon in our genetic code, is the only initiating codon. It is an initiating codon in the sense that it begins. It is at the beginning in the genetic structure of everything. Thus, we begin with\nthe 41 st hexagram, with the most important pressure in our evolutionary process now and ever since we became Homo sapiens, or modern humans. The 41st hexagram is the trigger that brought us into the stage\nthat we are in and we are still going towards completion.\n\nWhat is unique for us as human beings is the capacity to be able to feel. This capacity leads to the need, the desire for experience. The desire for experience to be able to feel and manifest that feeling is the\nhuman evolutionary process. It is what drives us from one experience to the next until we develop through that process. It also brings into play the nature of crisis. In other words, it tells us very clearly that the\nevolutionary process is rooted in crisis, change and transitoriness. The 41st gate, Decrease, is the gate of contraction and it is the fuel in which there is the energy to feel, or not. So, the whole capacity to feel, the\ncomplete potential that exists in our genetic spectrum, is rooted in the 41.\n\nIn looking at sexuality in Human Design, the 41 is the gate of fantasy, the capacity to be able to fantasize the feeling itself because all the feelings lie there. The old Chinese image of the 41st hexagram was the\ngardener who would cut back the garden in the wintertime or fall to prepare it for the following season.\nBy cutting it back, nothing was lost because all the potential of that plant, everything that that plant could possibly be, every twig, every leaf and every flower, was already there within it, contracted inside, held\ninside as a potential. So the 41st gate carries with it this enormous potential for any kind of experience.\n\nThis is the key to what it is to be human. Its mechanic is that it is always about hunger. A human being is so different from its animal kin. They only have one kind of hunger: basic, predatory hunger to stay alive.\nBut human beings have a duality in that. We have the material hunger, the hunger for survival, but we also have this other hunger, the deeper one: the human hunger for experience. To go to Mars and see what\nthe rocks look like. What for? Just to see what the rocks are. To discover America. What for? Just to see what is there on the other side. The basic fuel, the fundamental fuel for the evolutionary process, is the\nhunger to feel.\n\nPage 1\n\nThe whole key to being an abstract being, whatever kind of abstract definition you have, is that the essential understanding about life is rooted in something very simple: one step after the other. Don't\nrepeat your steps. Look at what that really is saying, like the 64th gate in the ajna: because there is so much potential information, built into these gates is a mechanism that is ready to release only one at a\ntime. In other words, all those feelings are built up within the nature of the 41 as a resource.\n\nAbove the lines in the black book it says, The limitation of resources which maximizes development of potential. If you have all these fantasies running around inside of you, it will diminish your potential. If\nyou focus your energy (the name of this channel) on one fantasy, on one feeling, then you can move through that. And when it is over, you can go on to the next one.\n\nThis is the key to the abstract process, this maximization of that potential by recognizing that this resource is always there. You don't have to have all the fantasies all the time, you can have one at a time and go\nthrough what is the correct evolutionary process.\n\n41.1 Reasonableness\n\nRemember, when you are looking at a hexagram, the first line is always going to represent not simply the foundation of the hexagram, but its essential truth. What is its basis?\n\nThe first line is Reasonableness. You can't have all of your fantasies because you will lose your power.\nYou must get one and then go on to the next. Reasonableness becomes the key. The appropriate delegation of responsibility. The first line is looking inward. It has no capacity to look outward. It is\ninterested in what the essential mechanism is. What is fantasy? That is the question that the first line always asks.\n\nWhen the first line of the 41 is a child, they want to know what the difference is between what is real and what is fantasy. They want to grasp that right away. What is fantasy? The appropriate delegation of\nresponsibility; it is the theme we have just been looking at.\n\nRemember that we are dealing with the root center, with the adrenaline hormone, the stress hormone. The root center carries with it enormous power. There is a tremendous fuel at work here. So, the appropriate\ndelegation of responsibility is how to use that energy. In other words, what fantasy, what feeling do you focus on? Don't get caught up in just seeing that fantasy. If you are somebody who is focusing on feeling\ngood about the day and feeling bad about your work and you are a Al. 1, you will be very uncomfortable.\nEither focus on the good feeling (that it is a nice day) or focus on feeling bad (because you are at work), but do not try to focus on both of them. It will not work for you. It will not be productive for you. It will\nnot be a healthy fueling of your potential.\n\nRemember the mirrors, the dualistic interplay in Design. The splenic system is our immune system. It is our protection from disease. We know that it is all about health. But recognize as well that there is illness\nthat strikes the solar plex system, this powerful motor emotional system: emotional illness, emotional unhealthiness, lack of balance, emotionally. When these fuels are properly recognized and you live out\ntheir nature, then the solar plex, the emotional system, benefits from that and it becomes healthier. It is getting a healthier fuel. These are pressures, and they carry with them a great deal of force. I would have\nused the word 'conditioning' but I do not want to confuse you. This power carries a great deal of force.\n\nThis line has Neptune exalted. The imagination to make the very best out of very little. You don't need to have all the feelings to get everything out of it. One focused feeling can take you all the way: always will,\nalways can. That Neptunian side tends to be people who are much more caught up in the fantasy of the\n\nPage 2\n\n41, the Neptunian quality of that. Anybody who has Neptune there has it veiled automatically. Think about that: the foundation is automatically veiled, so it can be very mysterious and it tends to be about\nfantasy on the non-manifesting side.\n\nThe Mercurial side: A tendency in understanding to assume capability, leading to strain. I always tell people with the 41 st gate: it is wonderful for you to have this feeling, this fantasy inside, but don't ever\nthink that there is more for you. Remember that everything about the abstract stream is about our process of expectations. If you do one step after the other, you assume that you will get somewhere because that is\nthe nature of the abstract process. The assumption of capability is when you look inside and you see you have this fantasy, you think that because you can fantasize it, you can do it. I can fantasize making love to\nMartians but I will not be able to do it. The reality is that for these people, this is often very difficult. You can see it in the white book. It talks about coolness and the hothead: the cool and hot of the pressure to\nfeel. This is the fundamental duality in fantasy: they are either cool or hot fantasies.\n\nCoolness, where the energy to release feelings is selective. In other words, one is clear about one feeling at a time. By the way, these feelings can come very quickly but as long as they are one at a time, it is\nokay. The hothead, the urge to release feelings. What happens to these people is that they can get into a great deal of trouble in life because they have within them this need to feel out what is essentially nothing\nmore than a fantasy, with very little odds of realizing it.\n\nRemember that only the fourth to the sixth lines really have the skills to integrate with the energy on the other side. The first line is simply there to look into the nature of the feeling, of the fantasy, but the\nmoment it is trying to live that out, it will get a lot of crises. If they are truly emotional people, they will enjoy their crises anyway. The 41st gate is a potential to release your own feelings and it is also a\npotential to condition the release of feelings in others.\n\nThe 41st hexagram is a nice meditation. You have to see that we have six steps in our evolutionary process, and we are not at the sixth line yet. Wie will all have very interesting experiences as a collective\n(not necessarily individually) with the movement of Neptune and Uranus reaching 41.6. It is an evolutionary process. We have gone as far as the fifth line. So, when you are looking at this process, the\nfirst thing to recognize about the very first step is that human evolution was rooted in focus on the feeling, and then you get the experience. That is how you learn. If you are sitting there and you have a zillion\nfeelings, you do not move. There is no way to go. The very first thing that distinguished us was the capacity to have a feeling, the fantasy to focus on that and to hold that focus until the potential, the 30th\ngate at the other end, to begin a process of actually manifesting that as experience was there.\n\n41.2 Caution\n\nWhen you come to the second line, you are no longer in the foundation. Now you have this deep genetic need to project the quality of the gate outwards: \"Here I am with the fuel to feel.\" In projecting it\noutwards, you have the word Caution. Humanism tempered by pragmatism. The evolutionary process begins in the individual, in the single being. The next step is that it has to become something broader than\nthat: collective.\n\nThe two sides of this are Saturn and Mars. A conservative nature that does not risk its own security in aiding others. You can fantasize how you can help somebody and you can then go and focus on that and\ndo it. You can fantasize on helping somebody and not be able to manifest that at all. You can have a feeling for starving children in Biafra and not send any coins. These things are all built into the Saturnian\nline.\n\nPage 3\n\nIn the white book: Energy for one's own feelings but not for others. To focus on one's own feelings, one's own fantasies, and not on the feelings of others or whatever their requirements happen to be.\n\nThe Martian side is The energy for the display of feelings for recognition. This is trying to get others to recognize that one is a feeling person. Remember that the second line is projecting outward.\n\nA desire for recognition that throws caution to the winds, depleting valuable resources for only temporary gain. This stream is about desire for change, for experience and about the desire to fulfill one's fantasies.\nIt is the expectation that if one has a fantasy and fulfills it, one is going to get something. The second line is projecting outwards that they have this resource inside of them.\n\nRemember the immaturity of Mars. Immaturity is not a question of good or bad. The immature 41.2, projecting out that they have the feeling that somebody hooks into, may discover that they are terribly\nequipped for that and it can end up being a crisis because they can be a paper tiger. The fact is that they are projecting something out and do not have the quality of the first line. They do not have this\nfoundation. On the Martian side, they put all the energy into projecting it out. They want people to connect to their feeling. They want to be able to get their fantasy to the next step. This can present all\nkinds of difficulties for them.\n\nThere is something else about this: already in this second line, which is very rare, there is a need for others. This is the most sexual of all the streams and there is no way that the human experience was going\nto be allowed to be individual. It wasn't. They are collective and, as such, early (in the second line, a line that is titled Humanism) there is a need to display this feeling for others to fulfill the feeling, the fantasy,\nthe collective process of not having the experience by yourself, but sharing the experience with somebody else. The second line is not equipped. It is Mars; it is immature and it has its problems with that. The\nexalted line, the Saturnian field, is more secure in that role.\n\n41.3 Efficiency\n\nOne of the dilemmas of the collective process is that somebody always starts it. So, in that essence, there is always an individual, a single being, that starts to change events. When you are looking at the whole\nevolutionary process here, you will see in the dualities of the lines that the exalted tend to point towards doing things by oneself, whereas the detriment says, \"No, we have to involve everybody else.\" The third\nline is classic of this. Remember that the third line is completing a process. It has qualities of the first and second line. It has completed the process in the sense that it is, within itself, ready to experiment.\n\nThe third line is about trial and error, bonds made and broken. It is about this learning process which is called Efficiency here. In times of decrease selfishness is justified. In that moment of your feeling, what it\nis saying is: release your energy into that feeling and you will discover whether that is a mistake or not.\nWait and see. But release all of your energy into that feeling. That is efficient.\n\nRemember that the adrenaline system, if it is defined in somebody, must be used. This energy must be worked. It is absolutely essential. When that energy is being used properly, that is what efficiency is all\nabout. Because it is a. third line, it means that you are not instantly efficient. It means that you have to learn how to be efficient, when to release energy into a fantasy, when to release energy into a feeling.\nThis is not about an awareness that tells you when. It is about a process that, if you don't do it right, it does not work and you learn from that experience and you try to do it differently the next time, as a result\nof that learning experience.\n\nSaturn exalted. Material ambition and the discipline to go at it alone; and The energy that fuels the feeling for personal ambition. Very much oriented towards someone's rather than the collective's experience. \"I\n\nPage 4\n\nwill see how that mushroom tastes. That is my fantasy. I want to feel what that is like. I want to have that experience.\" If the person drops dead after eating the mushroom, nobody else will do it. But if that person\nhas a wonderful trip and sees God and they tell their collective friends, \"Hey, I just saw God. All you have to do is to eat one of these,\" then it can become a collective experience, a collective feeling. What\nthis line is saying is that efficiency is to put your energy into your feeling and your fantasy.\n\nWhen you come to the other side, you have the Moon in detriment. I have my design Moon in this line. I know it well.\n\nInstinctive assistance, admirable but in this position misguided, where two will use up resources more than twice as fast as one. The energy that fuels the feeling to share. I am very individual. This is the only\npart of me that really is designed to give anything to anybody at any time. One of the jokes in my life is that my son has Saturn in the 41.3. He is always in my pocket. He is the selfish one and I have to share.\nThis feeling that one has to share: now, it is a detriment. Think of the jokes.\n\nThis whole stream is about the human experience and though each of these early lines are geared towards making sure that the evolutionary process goes on, somebody has to take the first step to go across the\nmountain. There is going to be this force underneath that says, \"Yes, but I have to take somebody with me in order to share the experience with me because otherwise, we do not have a humanity. \"V just have a\nkind of a bizarre species but we don't have what will become a strictly human phenomenon, something that we call culture. No culture, no civilization until we share our experiences. By the way, I have an\nundefined root center and my 41.3 is unconscious, so I do not trust that process. It is always conditioned by others.\n\n41.4 Correction\n\nWhen we get to the upper trigram, we get to a different kind of process because the fourth and fifth lines are oriented towards the other end of the channel. They recognize the potential at the other side through\ndefinition. By their very nature, the fourth and fifth lines are the social lines because it is inherent in their genetic capacity to integrate and to look across the channel for the definition.\n\nHere, we are dealing with a very collective stream, with an experiential stream, a sexual stream. That means we are dealing with very powerful forces. The moment you come to the fourth line, you come to\nthe fixedness of a fourth line. Fourth lines are unidirectional. They are fixed. The first thing we can recognize about that is that, given the nature of this gate, this is a very appropriate line. Decrease is\ndesigned to operate with one feeling at a time, with one fantasy you are focused on at a time. So, this unidirectional capacity in the fourth line is of value. You are focused and fixed on your feeling. You are\nholding back all of this fuel, waiting for the moment that the potential is there because you can recognize that when the potential is there, you can get that energy across, focused on it.\n\nWhat often happens is that 41.4's get locked into being fixed on one feeling, one fantasy, and can be fixed on a certain feeling or fantasy for a very long time, even throughout their whole life because it is this\nfixedness that is there. But there is a great advantage in that fixedness.\n\nThe line is called Correction. Successful adaptation to limitation. The limitation is, \"I am a fuel. I am not a potential.\" The limitation is very basic. In this line, the Earth is exalted. When we have the Earth\nexalted, you recognize that it is part of a regular cycle of the Earth. It is something that is going to happen twice a year. It is a very strong grounding force in that sense. Out of the Earth, we get our basic security.\n\nHere, we have a classic line. Survival of the fittest-in the Darwinian concept-and its eventual flourishing.\nThe fixedness of humanity on a feeling, on a fantasy, guaranteed that it would be the top of the food\n\nPage 5\n\nchain. We are to be at the top of the food chain. The survival of the fittest is our movement. The survival of the fittest is the perfection that comes out of being unidirectional in one's fantasy and feeling, to get\nthere finally, to be able to fly, to be able to go to space, to do whatever the case may be and to be fixed on that.\n\nThe Venusian side: The expenditure of energy on maintaining relationships rather than on correction. It immediately goes back into the powerful relationship field. In times of decrease, weak associations are\nshunned as costly, no matter how attractive. The survival of the fittest is that you are always in the process that you are fixed on but you have to adapt along the way. Otherwise, you will never get to your\ngoal.\n\nHere, the focus is different. The focus is pulled out to the other. Remember that the fourth and fifth lines will always go across. By being pulled out to the other, it loses its fixedness, but it maintains the\nrelationships. That is the other side of it. You have the fantasy that you want to be able to do something in a certain way and the people that you are with do not want to do it that way. They want to do something\nthat is similar, but their way. You do not want to lose them so you go along with that. Thus, you lose that fixedness which is very important. These people can end up being very frustrated because they don't get\nto live out this experience.\n\nAbout 50,000 years ago, we got to the point of this line. It was probably around the same time that we began to have relationships with animals in which we could not simply kill them but control them.\n\n41.5 Authorization\n\nThe first line always gives you the essential truth of the hexagram, but the fifth line is always how it is perceived by the world around us. We know that when we are dealing with the structure of a hexagram,\nwe are dealing with a resonance within a hexagram, the music within a hexagram. The first line is in resonance with the fourth line, the second with the fifth, and the third with the sixth. The foundation of\nknowing what a fantasy is leads to being able to externalize that fantasy and being fixed on getting that feeling out. In the second line, we saw the capacity to project out this fuel, this pressure within you, this\nresource for all these feelings and fantasies within you. When we get to the fifth line, we come to somebody who automatically is going to have projected on them that they have this resource, that they\nhave the feeling and the fantasy. \"1 know that person will go along with me. I know that they have the same feeling I have.\" This is projected onto that person. They may or may not.\n\nThis fifth line is called Authorization. Think about this in evolutionary terms. This is the stage of our evolutionary process that we are in now. We have given authority (we have projected authority) onto this\nessential process of experience. From the moment that we entered into this stage of our development, we have had more experiences than we could ever possibly have imagined earlier. The 20th century is full of\nmore human experiences than have ever existed in the whole history of the planet up until now. We have given authority to the experiential way. This is what it is to be human. Vas go after this and that, and we\ngo to Mars and the stars, etc., until we finally shake hands with God.\n\nAuthorization. The external recognition of one's potential despite limitations. Think about the nature of what it is to have any root gate that has no natural outlet. You have this powerful motor with all this\nessential fuel, all this essential resource material waiting for that opportunity, waiting within the limitation of only being fuel. Do not attribute awareness to any of these gates. They are not aware; they are fuels.\nThat fuel is not a potential. The 30 is the potential, the 36 is the possibility and the manifestation does not come until you get all the way up to the Progress in the throat. There is a lot of limitation in just having\nthe fantasy or the resource of the feeling. You may never get them out.\n\nPage 6\n\nThink about the 41.5. They have a greater chance to release their feelings and fantasies than anybody else on Earth because everybody else is ready to project on them that they have a feeling and a fantasy. So,\nthese people are always at risk because they can end up just firing rockets. Everybody comes up to them and says, \"Aha. I know that you want to do this with me. Let me provide you with the potential, okay?\"\n\nMars exalted. That tells you something right away. Whenever you see Mars exalted you know that this is all about just let it go.' The value of energy when properly channeled. There are people in America who\nasked me if this was a channeling line. The answer is yes. It is written here. Properly channeled energy is the whole thing. 'Channeling' in English means to allow the energy to flow properly. The moment that\nsomebody comes up to you and recognizes your capacity to feel or to have a fantasy and they offer you that opportunity, they can do exactly what this gate is all about. You can focus on releasing that feeling or\nfantasy and getting it out. The immature Mars means to get the feeling out right away, and then it is over.\nThat is the limitation.\n\nThe fuel for properly channeled feelings despite limitations. These people are always being projected upon. They are always given these opportunities. These people are not well. Remember that about them.\nThey can be but, like all things that have to do with powerful energies that are not part of an awareness, given the nature of how human beings see themselves, this can present a great many problems because\neverybody is projecting on these people, \"You feel for me. Your fantasy and my fantasy are one.\" They are constantly having people project on them, constantly pulling out that fuel at the same time. So, these\npeople can go through a roller coaster of feelings and fantasies. They get burdened by crisis in their process.\n\nVenus in detriment. Look at the fourth line and the fifth lines which are the only social lines. We have a collective stream and we know that it is deeply social. It is about the development of humanity, and\nVenus rules the world. It rules our planet. Venus is in charge of our morals and is responsible for establishing, within the human environment, within the human community, what is right and wrong. It\nestablishes our basic values which then get translated into our cultural styles, our interrelationships with each other. And yet, in both of these lines, Venus is in detriment. Because the moment that you are\ndealing with fantasy and feeling and its complete capacity, whatever Venus thinks is right, it will look for some wrong and whatever Venus sees that is wrong, the stream will look for something else anyway. In\nother words, the basic values always get broken in this process. They have to because everything needs to be experienced. The moment you have a good guy, you have a bad guy.\n\nLimitations initiate the fuel for negative feelings. Think about what that is like for a 41.5, when somebody comes up to them and says, \"I am deaf, dumb and blind. Could you give me three bucks?\" It is very\ndifficult for them not to give the energy and, after a while, they get very dissatisfied with other human beings feeding on their fuel. After all, the capacity of the five is that it is at the end of the hexagram\nprocess. The six is beyond that. It knows the game. When I say 'know', I mean this in the genetic sense. It is built into it. It knows that one feeling at a time is correct and it has to be its feeling. It is great to share it\nbut it has to be its own feeling, not simply yanked out by everyone.\n\nWherever you see a fifth line, you have the theme of being victimized, used by others, in that sense, because they can so easily project onto you that you have that inherent capacity. The nature of the fifth\nline is always this balance on either side. That is, to have others project on you is a great value and a great opportunity. These people do get the opportunity to experience so many feelings and fantasies in their\nlives because others will project on them and give them that opportunity to release it. But at the same time, so many of those opportunities to experience are not really for them to experience. It is simply\nbecause it is so easy to hook into that energy and pull it out. If you have the line and you are aware of the mechanism, it is not that you can change the impact of somebody hooking into it but, by being aware of\n\nPage 7\n\nwhat is happening, it is much less attractive to be pulled out of your limitation. This is the whole thing about having energy.\n\nI have a defined ego. I will offer my willpower sometimes to others, but not always. Before I became aware of that energy, I was always empowering everybody around me with my will. I do not do that\nanymore. It is not something that I trained myself. It is a byproduct of being aware of your own nature. It is one of those things that come with the recognition of mechanics.\n\nThe other thing that we always have as a footnote to any of these discussions is that any of these aspects, any of these lines, can only be seen in the context of somebody's design. How those things are going to\noperate and how they will function is always dependent on the nature of somebody's design. For so many people that will have the same line, it is a different configuration. You have 41.5's that are connected to\nthe Sacral and it is always generating, but it is only really correct for them when they are responding, so they have different rules.\n\nYou have manifestors with the 41.5, where the energy might go through the spleen and go up to the throat and they can always manifest this energy. You have people who have undefined root centers, or you have\n41.5's connected to the 30, not connected to the sacral or the throat. These people are called Projectors.\nWhat that means is that they have to be recognized by others; otherwise, they can never experience their process. Whatever the line is, it always ends up of being a matter of what kind of definition is there. It is\nalways the key to how the energy will ultimately come out in the life.\n\n41.6 Contagion\n\nWhen you get to the sixth line, please keep in mind that we are looking at this 41st hexagram as a key to understand our human evolutionary process. When I say human evolutionary process, I do mean strictly\nthat. This time frame that we have, in which we are in these kinds of vehicles and functioning the way we do, we are at the stage of the fifth line, but we are not yet at the stage of the sixth line. We will first deal\nwith the mutation that will bring about the awakening of what we call emotional consciousness, or spirit consciousness. But there is something else that has to take place. One of the more mysterious things that\nthe Voice told me about our evolutionary process is that when the change comes, when we lose these vehicles and we go on to our next process, that this stream that starts in the 41 and goes all the way up,\nwill disappear. It will not exist anymore and this reality is built into this line.\n\nContagion. The law that the maximization of potential not only ends decrease (ends feeling, ends fantasy) but inevitably such transcendence benefits others.\n\nThink about how I describe what the nature of emotional or spirit consciousness is like. We have emotional waves that are being generated and, between those waves as they interact with each other, there\nis a field, an interactive field, a field where the consciousness actually will exist. We do not understand such a thing. It is not possible anyway to understand it in the logical sense of the word. This is something\nwhere our experience of consciousness will be outside of our individual bodies and will not be our own consciousness, but it will be a consciousness that we are sharing with somebody else, or a group of\npeople, or ultimately, a planetary field. Something that is in a slow developing process.\n\nWhen you get to the sixth line of a hexagram, you get to the roof of the house. You get to the end of the process. We know that we find the potential of wisdom in every sixth line and, therefore, it is less likely\nto function in the nature of what the hexagram is than any of the other lines. It says, \"What for?\" and \"Why should I? I want to see the whole thing.\" You cannot see the whole experiential field. It is not\npossible. The law is that the maximization of potential ends in decrease, ends this process of constantly needing another experience. This process of constantly going from one thing to the next will come to an\n\nPage 8\n\nend. But inevitably such transcendence (after all, it is transcendence we are talking about here) benefits others. At the moment that we are no longer looking for the new experience, we are all in one thing\ntogether, as long as there is not the drive within humanity that it has to be more.\n\nSaturn exalted. The maximization of the potential of form. The father (or the mother) whose success will benefit his children. It is very important to understand that the children of Homo sapiens, if you look at\nthis from the mystical side, will be something else. This transition out of the experiential way, its completion, will lead to the transcendence that not those who do transcend will experience. They will go\nthrough a period of discomfort, but what follows will benefit from all of that.\n\nBy the way, that has mundane applications as well, like all lines. The 41.6, when it can make a fuelling commitment to an energy, can ultimately benefit others through that and be of value. It is called\nContagion. They can lead all kinds of human beings into an experiential trend. These people can be trendsetters. But ultimately, the major trend, the ultimate trend, the mystical trend, is when we have a lack\nof experience: when the need for experience, the desire for experience, is left behind. That is when the process is complete. We are not there yet.\n\nPluto in detriment. The tendency in transcendence to keep it a secret in fear of being deprived of its special advantages. This is what we are going to experience in the next century. The way in which\nevolution works is that we will have pockets all over the planet of different kinds of creatures, like us, that have different capacities than we do, not in any science fiction sense of the word but simply in that they\nwill begin to experience each other, from the moment of birth, in a consciousness field that they will not be able to describe. In most cases, they will never share it with anybody else because it will seem rather\nbizarre. They will be the ones that are different in the way in which experience is initiated because they will stop it. You will have a generation of children who are born that will have the 41, 30, 36, 35 and they\nwould not appear to us to be abstract at all. They themselves will have a feeling of almost being stuck.\nThey will be the root of cults in the next century that will say that, not only is it all coming to an end, but they are already dying from it, that there is no place to go, that there is nowhere for humanity to go, that\nhumanity is going to die out. They will have a lot of confirmation of that because it will look like that. We will have a vast decrease in population.\n\nHere in the white book: The fuel for recognition through feelings; and The fuel for secret or repressed feelings. Be careful with the words 'repressed feelings'. Ultimately, that is what is going to take place, in\nthat sense. The first thing that will happen is that these feelings will be repressed. The need for experience, the need for fantasy will be repressed, not repressed in the unhealthy sense that we use this\nlanguage now, but simply because that is going to be the genetic capacity to start holding back this need for more experience.\n\nPlease understand that we are moving towards a time in which we need to be vastly organized, organized in the most intimate way. That organization comes out of the logical field which requires repetition and\nexperimentation, and not out of the abstract field. What will happen here is that the whole abstract field will begin to be repressed and if you meet a 41.6, you will see that if you ask them, \"Do you fantasize a\nlot?\" they say, \"No.\" \"Are you full of all these feelings?\" \"No.\" The mechanism is already at work and goes along with the sixth line quality of why should I? It is already at work.\n\nTransit: Uranus in 41.6\n\nThe Human Design System is a Uranian system, and wherever Uranus goes in the wheel is significant for humanity. Every 84 years, Uranus comes to the 41st gate. This time that Uranus is there, it is going to\ninitiate an 84 year cycle that will culminate with the beginning of this transition. It will take well over a thousand years for humanity to get to this sixth line. It will not happen tomorrow or in the next century.\n\nPage 9\n\nEvolution on the human scale is a very slow process. This emotional spirit consciousness has already been with us for thousands of years and yet, we did not have any tools to really be able to look at it until\nvery recently.\n\nIn the children that are born with Uranus in 41, particularly those who are born with Uranus in the 41.6, they will begin the pull43ack in this experiential way. They will be the first generation of abstract children\n(it is depending on the design) who do not seem to function that way. These children, in our time, over the next 20 years, will be clinically looked at as being repressed. \"No, my Johnny does not want to try to ride\na bicycle. I do not understand it. I can't get him on the bicycle. I think that he is afraid of bicycles.\" It is simply because this is beginning to work and Uranus is initiating this new experience, especially in the\nsixth line. Uranus will bring that out in the children, so that there is already this genetic field that is beginning to operate and the children who are born with the 41.6 will be alive deep into the next century.\nThey carry this energy with them and keep the aura of this energy alive in the world. They are setting the foundation for this transition.\n\nYou can see some of that now in what people call the AIDS epidemic. One of the things about the stream\n41 to 35 is that it is the most sexual of all the streams. It is literally rooted in sexuality for the experience and that experience can be anything. In that sense, you can already see that this repression of those things\nis something that will come very strongly.\n\nYou will have a reaction to this in the environment until all of the experiences, the feelings and desires that we acquaint with being human will slowly be repressed, be restricted, so that we can become more\nand more organized without constantly being dragged out of the organization by the need of the abstract person to have a different kind of feeling. \"You are designed to be an architect\". \"I know but I have this\nfeeling that I want to be an astronaut. \" The planet has to eliminate this other side that automatically pulls you to say, \"Yes, but wouldn't it be great if...?\"\n\nFor us, nothing that I am describing is particularly pleasant. For us, we are part of the aura of the fifth line where we give authority to experience. Without experience, you do not know. That is why we have virtual\nreality. Nobody gets the experience, vie already have vast movements at work to take us out of needing to physically have the experience ourselves, and yet, we have come into the world in a time where it still has\nits authority. We will have its authority for hundreds of years. There will be a great reaction to that. In your work over the next years, it is important to recognize that, as these children are coming on a stream,\nparticularly children that come with the 41.6, they cannot be pushed into the experiential way by their parents. They will become very ill because they are the first generation that is there not to get pulled into\nthat. They have to be aloof from it.\n\nThe experiential drive is coming to an end. The whole experiential nature of being human is coming to an end. In other words, we are at the flourishing of that. We are getting so many experiences. We are\ncollecting so much data. We will now go down the other side. Ever since Neptune left 61, we are going down the other side, the other slope. Everything is being reduced. We start to pull things back. We are not\ndriven into new experiences anymore. We are locked into old experiences, trying to stay alive and survive and flourish. We will not look for something new, but we will go back to the basics.\n\nThe deepest event in the next century will be that the fertility capacity in humans will be devastated. We have to go back to basic things and be very well organized in order to keep the species alive. We will not\nbe able to tolerate all kinds of drives for different experiences when the species itself is threatened. These are all mechanisms that will come into work in the next century.\n\nIt is like the project to Mars. They spend 256 million dollars to get it there. They are spending about 1 12 million dollars a day tracking it. When somebody comes along in the next century and says, \"Okay, now\n\nPage 10\n\nthat we have gone to Mars, why don't we go to Pluto?\" There will be people who say, \"Wait a minute.\nWhy? We could take all of this money and give it to starving children and poor people. \" We have to stay with the basics of what we need to have to be organized properly. It is not to say that we won't do things,\nbut the pragmatism of what it is to keep humanity alive will restrict the way we use resources. That is what the 41 is all about. It is wonderful to look at the pictures they took of Mars, but we come to the point\nwhere people reject that. Resources have to go back into our hands to increase our fertility.\n\nPage 11",

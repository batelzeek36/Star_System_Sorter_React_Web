They simply withdraw that part of them. When you meet a 54.6, you are not likely to meet somebody who\nobviously is ambitious.

The Jupiter says, \"I know what type it has to be, and I'll turn this person into that type.\" It does not work. When I say that it does not work, that\ndoes not work generally. It does not mean that it won't work at all. There are many cases in which the politician has been groomed in that sense. Somebody who really did not have it is groomed by somebody\nelse, so that they really look like they have it.\n\nPage 5\n\nThe general sense of how it operates in the world is that it tends to be what it is for most sixth lines. They simply withdraw that part of them. When you meet a 54.6, you are not likely to meet somebody who\nobviously is ambitious. They hold back from ambition until they see the opportunity where they can rise up: either if the person is exactly the right person or because they think, out of the Jupiterian aspect, that\nthey can transform that person and make it the right person.\n\nPage 6"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 54 THE MARRYING MAIDEN\n\nThe 54th hexagram is both the most mundane of all the fuels which come out of the root and the most un- mundane. There is no real word for that un-mundane. The vast majority of people that possess this gate,\ntheir fuel is necessary to be able to bring out success within the tribe. We know that the 54th gate is called the Marrying Maiden. If you turn the number around, you get the 45 and you get to where the Marrying\nMaiden wants to be, which is to be the queen in the 45th gate.\n\nThe Marrying Maiden is the gate of drive. This is a very powerful fuel. It is the drive to succeed because on the other side is the fear of failure. It is the drive to succeed on the material plane because its natural\npath is to the 21/45. It is the drive to live in a material community. That is a communal material community in which you have shops, and clients who become your family customers. The 54th gate is the\ndrive to transform or not and in this transform-or-not is the magic that will come across in the fourth line.\n\nWithin the 54 always lies this possibility of transformation. Remember that the gate at the other end is not only the gate of failure but the most conservative of all gates. It is quite something to transform that\nconservativeness. This is a very powerful field. Its energy mechanic is about liquid production. That is not to sound obscure. It gives us a deep insight into the nature of this gate because it is fuelling instinct.\nInstinct is rooted in the deepest of memories. Memory is stored in the liquid of the cells. Here, this liquid production is the 54, the beginning of memory storage. The 54 has a lovely gift. It only remembers\nwinning and succeeding, instinctively, that is. The 32 at the other end will always remember failure. That is the balance.\n\nAt the top of the lines it says: Interaction in its most mundane social context, but also one's mystical and cosmic relationships. Built in here, in the most mundane, can be the most exalted spiritual experience.\n\nOn the other side, in the 19/49, we have the mystical channel of the tribe. Here, in the mirror on the splenic side, we have this incredible potential. I had a lot of dealings with sannyasins. One of the things\nthat I like most of all about the nature of the sannyasins through Osho was his recognition of the importance of the material in our lives, this recognition that you must go out into the world and you must\ntriumph on the mundane plane in order to live out true spirituality. It is very easy to be enlightened when you sit on the mountain and nobody sees you. It is another thing to be enlightened and having to work in\nthe super-market. This is a very different story and if you can do it there, that is the real thing. Thus, lying within this truly mundane gate is a recognition that what is truly mundane is the only spiritual way. You\nmust live your awareness in your life moment by moment, breath by breath.\n\nThe fact that this stream about the tribal process has an individual nature should not mask that this is tribal and communal. It is about the nature of support. It is very important to understand that because this\ngate is deeply misunderstood. What the nature of this drive and ambition is all about is misunderstood.\n\n54.1 Influence\n\nThis first line is called Influence. It is a strange line if you do not really understand what this gate is all about. The line says: The ability to achieve influence through secret relationships, anywhere from the\nprivate adviser to the Satanist. In the white book: Ambition energized through secret relationships which fuel influence. Think about what this really means. If you really want to rise up, you can not just call out\nand say, \"I want to rise up,\" because there is no way to go. When a 54.1 says, \"I can help you rise up,\" then they get power because of their fuel, their ability to be the adviser, to be the secret one behind the\nmass. They say to others, \"Do this. Do that.\" In doing that, as the other rises up, they rise with them. As they rise with them, slowly they gain power over the very one that they have been helping to transform.\n\nPage 1\n\nUnderstand the nature of this 54th gate. The moment that the ambition is for oneself, there is no influence.\nThe ambition has to be pointed towards the other. \"Let me help you. Let me work for you. I really think what you are doing is great. Let me help you out.\" In that, they gain power.\n\nVenus in detriment. A socially misguided insistence on formal recognition of a relationship that in terms of influence will diminish its power. \"I want everybody to know that it was my idea, and not yours.\"\nPower over. It is gone. If you don't tell anybody, they will eventually figure it out anyway. \"It wasn't really him, it was her.\" That is the power that is inherent here. Ambition which demands formal\nrecognition, limiting influence. The basis of ambition is for the community to succeed. The individual can rise up by helping somebody else and they themselves will gain the influence and eventually rise up.\n\n54.2 Discretion\n\nWhen we come to the second line, you can see how different a second line can be from a first line. The first line is introspective and it is looking at its foundation. It is looking inward to see how one can truly\nrise up. It is looking inward to see how we can help somebody else rise up in order to take advantage of that. When you get to the second line, you simply project outwards that you will be discrete. Look at these\nfirst three lines, they really tell you so much about ambition. Keep everything secret. Keep everything quiet and closed in. This line is called Discretion. Covert interaction is about not showing it. Don't let\nthem see how ambitious you really are. So, here you have discretion. The energy that these people are projecting outwards is that they will not tell anybody. Of course, that may or may not be true.\n\nSaturn exalted. The wisdom, once a relationship gets formally recognized, to restrain the temptation to take advantage of past informal interactions. \"Yes, your friend is made assistant vice president. But you\nare not going to remind him in public that in his last job, he was a mess and he covered out so-and-so very nicely.\" You restrain yourself from letting that out so that you can hold on to your power. Otherwise, your\nambition will fail. The moment that you are not discrete, you can lose the advantage that you have gained.\nThe energy of restraint fuels ambition.\n\nThe detriment is Mars. It means immaturity. Recognition, in the formal sense, seen as a license to take advantage of informal knowledge. A lack of loyalty. Here is somebody who said, \"Okay, now that I have\nit formally recognized and everybody knows that it was my idea, I can blow this turkey off and take their place. While we are sitting in this meeting, I will let everybody else know what kind of a fool this person\nis.\"\n\nLack of loyalty. I make that sound terrible. Don't believe for a moment that we do not need lack of loyalty, like anything else. It is so important to understand that. The person who generated that concept,\nwho was of value to the community and did that informally and gets recognized for it, they feel all right.\n\"I get recognized for it. Why shouldn't I go on to the next stage, because I have the skills for that?\" After all, this gate is called Ambition. It is others who may consider that a lack of loyalty. This is a projected\nfield. This is the whole thing to understand about this in order that you don't get stuck in these things that we have prejudices about. You can see how they work. This is simply mechanical and we have two sides\nto this mechanic.\n\n54.3 Covert interaction\n\nThird lines. Bonds made and broken as its frequency. Trial and error as a theme. Here you have the title of Covert interaction.\n\nPluto exalted. The ability, when stymied in formal relationships, to use secret or purely informal channels when it is the only resort. Think about how this works. All of these first three lines carry with them\n\nPage 2\n\nbasically the same theme. How this works is that you have somebody that is, for example, working in the military, and they got to a certain rank and then they can't get any further. They get no more formal\nrecognition that they should go higher up in that military order. Because they keep on trying to move the ladder further up and they keep on getting denied, what they do then is that they get involved in covert\ninteraction, in their ambition to find a way to subvert that order. Usually we call that a coup d'etat, and all of a sudden you have a country that is being run by Sergeant Dow. It is not General Dow, not Colonel or\nLieutenant Dow, but Sergeant Dow. Remember that it is conditional and only when they are stymied. It does not mean that they will be stymied all the time. In other words, these people will only use covert\ninteraction when blocked.\n\nThe drive when blocked to use secret means to fuel ambition. Most of the time, with the force these people have, they don't get blocked but because it is trial and error, there will be these bonds that are\nbroken in these relationships and it will be necessary to find some other way to get around them in order to continue one's process.\n\nVenus in detriment. The insistence that formal channels, no matter how frustrating, can be overcome by the power of attraction. This, again, goes back to the same thing. This means, using the same military\nanalogy, that even though they get stymied over and over and over again in trying to get the promotion, they will try to make themselves indispensable to the local general. They keep on offering their services,\nthey keep on getting involved, they build up an informal relationship hoping that their very attraction and their very ability to integrate with that person will end up with them finally getting the next step up the\nladder, that they think or believe they deserve.\n\nThe energy of ambition when blocked will fuel the power of attraction to overcome the obstacle. If you can't to do it formally, you find some way to ingratiate yourself with the one in charge so that they will\naccept you at another level, and hopefully that will lead to your ambition being fulfilled. You can see clearly here that we are dealing with a communal supportive process in which the rising up is conditioned\non somebody being there to help that process: somebody who gets empowered by these people, somebody who is fueled in their ambition in order that the others' ambition can be realized in the lifetime.\nIt is very powerful. Something to always see in a reading with somebody who has this 54th gate is for them to understand that their greatest success will come by first making somebody else successful.\n\nUltimately, they will get the rewards and the recognition for that energy but it has to be seen second hand.\nIt has to come from others recognizing it, by seeing it, and in its apparent selflessness. \"I did it so that this person could make it.\" They end up being seen as the ones that should be transformed and promoted and\nmoved up the ladder. They are company people and work for the program. They are not just interested in themselves, and they are so pleased when they finally sit in the chairman's seat and they run the\norganization. The fairy tale associated with this gate is Cinderella. Often, these people have a smell of who they can bribe. They know by instinct with whom covert interactions are possible. They properly\nsmell it, but as a third line, they also make mistakes and learn from them.\n\n54.4 Enlightenment/Endarkenment\n\nWhen you come to this fourth line, it is the only line that is intrinsically different from the traditional\nI'Ching. That is, in its pure nature obviously there is no description. At the time of the discovery of\nUranus, that was when the 54.4 went through its transformation, so we are dealing with something that is just a couple of hundred years old. One of the ways to look at this fourth line is to recognize something\nabout the nature of what we have been looking at in terms of how ambition actually functions. The\nMarrying Maiden, this ability to rise up, to have this drive and ambition, is always conditioned by a decline of drive and ambition of others, in order for them to rise up. In the externalization of that line lies\n\nPage 3\n\nperhaps the ability to see that one is doing in the world what one would like the world to do for oneself.\nDo for the totality what you hope the totality will do for you.\n\nThere is this need to recognize that Enlightenment/Endarkenment is not about achieving that for oneself.\nIf one tries to achieve that for others, that is how one finds it. So we have a world filled with priests trying to lead others to the spiritual door so that they can find it. Built into this fourth line is this recognition that\nenlightenment, or whatever these terms mean, this deep spiritual process, is not about ourselves. It is not our enlightenment or endarkenment. This comes elsewhere. This is about what is possible for the totality\nbecause anyone who has this line cannot benefit from it unless they are benefiting from whoever can get it through them.\n\nIf you are a 54.4 and you do somebody's reading, it is more likely that the reading will have a greater impact on you than it has on them because that is the way that will operate. Depending on the person and\nthe situation, you are obviously going to deal with that on a different level. But it is so important to understand that at the core of communal or tribal spirituality is this recognition that there is no reward\nunless you are serving others, and we have a lot of that in our tribal religion. We have all kinds of people such as missionaries who dedicated themselves to being of service in order to find it themselves.\n\n54.5 Magnanimity\n\nWe know that the fourth and fifth lines have the capacity to deal with the other side. They are equipped for it. You notice that both of them are singularities. There is no polarity in these lines. They are very\nspecific. When you get to the fifth line, you know that it is being projected on. So, what we have already learned in the first line about the nature of ambition is that it works best behind the throne. When you get\nto the fifth line, everybody assumes that the 54.5 is the power behind the throne. They are always given that assumption, even if it is not true. \"They are the ones that are really in charge,\" people say, even if it is\nnot true. Everybody projects on them that they really are the ones in charge. That is why it is called\nMagnanimity. The way everybody else sees the 54.5 is, \"Isn't that nice. They are willing to help me. How magnanimous of them,\" without the deep recognition that by allowing them to help you, they will go\nbeyond you. They will use you as a way to move up the ladder. When I say 'use you,' I don't mean that in the negative sense.\n\nHere in Magnanimity, the Sun is exalted. The natural authority and actualizing spirit, that in a position of power can have genuine and fruitful relationships with the less advantaged (as long as they are in service\nand make no demands). That is, if it is not a position of power, it cannot have fruitful relationships.\n\nIn the white book: The energy for actualizing that despite this power fuels fruitful relationships with others. Due to the fact that this person is always projected on to be the power behind the throne, it does\nnot matter what job they have. As long as they are recognized for their power and everybody treats them accordingly, they will continue to give their energy to the people around them who need that energy to\nkeep on succeeding. If they are not given the respect of that power, then all kinds of problems can come out of this because for them it is absolutely essential. They cannot be magnanimous unless they have\npeople around them that are going to respect them and recognize their real power. It is essential for them.\nAs long as that real power is recognized, it is okay.\n\nIf you are the power behind the throne and the king treats you like a god, everything is great. You don't have to be king and you can have a good time with the king who is lesser than you are. And you can have\na good time with all those people down there you don't want to deal with because you get that recognition. But if the king treats you like a servant and you have made the king, this will not work. The\n54.5 is given a great advantage. It is assumed that they will be the source of power. It is assumed that they\n\nPage 4\n\nare the ones that can help bring about success. Therefore, they will get their opportunities, like all fifth lines.\n\n54.6 Selectivity\n\nAll sixth lines are looking at the nature of the circuit. If you are the Marrying Maiden, and you are looking at the whole circuit and you are a sixth line, you are looking at the 45 which says, \"I am the queen\nor the king, and I have.\" For any communal sixth line, particularly in the 54.6, the only ambition worth fuelling is an ambition that is going to take them to that place where they are going to be the ruler, and\nthey are going to have that because that is the completion of what this is all about: in doing that and in getting to that place, and being fulfilled in that.\n\nThis line is called Selectivity, and it is about people. After all, we are dealing with community and support. Saturn exalted. The ingrained responsibility, in terms of maintaining security and personal\nidentity, that will naturally restrict its relationships to ones that are mutually beneficial This is very clear.\nThe energy to restrict relationships that hinder ambition. Just because there is somebody that can help, who may be able to get me to here or there does not mean that I will, unless it is mutually beneficial and it\nis a relationship that is really of value to me that I can enjoy it, and that it is a person that I can work with.\nThis becomes a key at that level.\n\nOn the other side, Jupiter in detriment. A generally benefit and expansive nature that assumes that it can instill what is otherwise missing in its partners. A waste of energy. In the white book: A waste of energy\nin maintaining relationships which hinder ambition. Let's say, that you have a politician that is running for political office and you have somebody who has the Saturn side. As long as this person is somebody they\ncan work with, as long as it is mutually beneficial, they will get involved in supporting this person but only if they know that if that person gets elected, they are going to get some kind of cushy government\njob that will pay them a lot in whatever form on the material plane. The Jupiterian side will look at the politician and will think, \"Oh my god. This one will not win but this one has told me that I will get this\ncushy job, if they do win. So I will do the very\" best that I can to give them the ambition, the tools and the fuel that they need because I can change them, transform them, so that they can be a winner.\" A waste of\nenergy. That is on the other side.\n\nRemember that we are dealing with a communal sixth line. Communal sixth lines are much more ready to make a commitment than any other of the sixth lines due to the nature of the tribe and community. The\nthing to recognize about the power inherent in this is that these people really do have a way of climbing the ladder, but it is specifically about whether or not they can grasp and understand the nature of people.\nThis is the most important gift to somebody who has the 54th gate. They have to understand the nature of humans and how they work. This going underneath the secret, the covert, to go deep inside to understand\nthe mechanism of people: What turns them on? What moves them, and what doesn't? What drives them?\nBecause in the end, the great success that is possible only comes as communal success, because this is a tribal stream. It only comes by having those right forces.\n\nIf you are a 54 and you are carrying all this power inside of you to bring about transformation, and the person that offers you that opportunity or the person you connect to does not have what it takes, you will\nnot rise up because they don't rise up. The third line learns this right away. It makes all kinds of mistakes about who it gets involved with. The sixth line, in its wisdom, says, \"I know exactly what kind of person\nshould be there.\" The Saturn restricts everything else but that type. The Jupiter says, \"I know what type it has to be, and I'll turn this person into that type.\" It does not work. When I say that it does not work, that\ndoes not work generally. It does not mean that it won't work at all. There are many cases in which the politician has been groomed in that sense. Somebody who really did not have it is groomed by somebody\nelse, so that they really look like they have it.\n\nPage 5\n\nThe general sense of how it operates in the world is that it tends to be what it is for most sixth lines. They simply withdraw that part of them. When you meet a 54.6, you are not likely to meet somebody who\nobviously is ambitious. They hold back from ambition until they see the opportunity where they can rise up: either if the person is exactly the right person or because they think, out of the Jupiterian aspect, that\nthey can transform that person and make it the right person.\n\nPage 6",

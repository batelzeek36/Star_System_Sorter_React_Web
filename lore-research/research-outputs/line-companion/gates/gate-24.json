  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 24 RETURNING\n\nHere, we have the individual acoustic process in the center. The individual mind resonates both to the splenic side, the awareness wave, and the emotional wave and it is always all over the place in time. It is\nnot simply in the now. There is only one gate that is existential, the 20th gate, and even that is relative.\nThe now is something that does not last very long.\n\nWe are dealing with the relative present when we are dealing with individuality and that present is always both reflecting on what is past and projecting on what is in the future. But it is not doing this visually.\n\nThis is an acoustic process and it has to do with what has been taken in, in terms of what has been heard.\nPart of what we hear, we hear very accurately in the now and other parts of what we hear, we don't hear well at all. We hear in waves. This means that we only remember parts of what has been said, not all of it.\n\nWhen you are dealing with the nature of the individual, you are dealing with the dilemma of knowing. To know what you can know, to know what you can know but what is not important for you to know, and to\nknow what is unknowable. If you cannot distinguish between those three, you will never find silence in your mind. That is the one thing the individual mind is looking for: silence. In the same way that the\nabstract mind does not want any bad, old movies anymore, the individual mind would just like to have silence, quiet in there.\n\nWe are looking at the channel of Awareness, a design of a thinker, and Returning, the gate of\nRationalization: the awareness to struggle for knowing or mot. This is the whole thing. Can. it be known?\nThis goes back to the: 28/38, the channel of Struggle, amd the 28, the fear of death.. Is it really worthwhile?' 16 life of value? Is itworth it? Its it something that can be known amd, if so, does it deserve\nstruggle? Is itworthwhile to really know it? You can become a nudear physicist but it-does not mean that it is worthwhile for you to have that kind of knowledge.\n\nIt is just not about recognizing what is knowable. It is about whether you should struggle for that kmowimg or not. The. awareness potential is the relentlessness, of the unresolved thinking. The return:\nyou go back again and again because! yow cani t resolve it and,, until you can resolve it, you will not have silence. You have to resolve whether it is knowable, whether it is worth knowing and worth\nstruggling for.\n\nAbowei the lines; it says:: The natural and spontaneous process of translorntwtufon and renewal. It is the pulse. One moment it is not there and the next moment you can know it.\n\n24.1 The Sin of omission\n\nFirst line, foundation: The. sin of omission. Transformation that requires retrogressive periods before renewal can take place. Sun exalted. The will to triumph and in this case the faith thatthe end jusfihes the\nmeans.. All of this is the result of inspiration. The 24 gets an inspiration and, as it says; in the white book:\nInspiration that demands a reassessment of past thinking before a rational concept can be established. Is this really the knowing? Do I really know this? I have to go back and see if this is really correct.\n\nThe Neptune in detriment. Self-delusion which unnaturally justifies periods of retrogression. In the white book: Inspiration that leads to an irrational focus on what is past. Everything about the individual is the\npotential for what is new. They live in a collective and tribal world and the whole thing for them is that they are always looking for the framework. \"Is this something that I can make rational?\" The only way to\nmake it rational is: \"What is it like?\" so then they go back into their knowing system. \"Is it like this or like this? Is it really different?\"\n\nPage 1\n\nThe whole foundation of the knowing process is to eliminate what is not original because the moment that you see that it is something from the past, the moment that you can reference it, is the moment you put it\naside.\n\nThe whole thing about the individual mind is that it has to generate something new. It is not there to produce something that is old. For example, you are working on a piece of music and you have a tune that\nis running through your head and you think, \"I just came up with a nice tune. That is my tune.\" If you have the first line, there is immediately this, \"Wait a minute, let's check it out. Is it really my tune? Did I\nhear this somewhere else before? Is it like another song that I heard?\" In the detriment, you get so focused in that that you never sing your own tune because you are constantly going back and trying to figure out:\n\"Did I borrow this from somebody? Did somebody influence me with this? Is it really mine?\" If it is not really theirs, they cannot keep it.\n\n24.2 Recognition\n\nThis line has no introspection. So, here we have Recognition. The Moon exalted. The proper and spontaneous adaptation to new forms. \"I have this new melody.\" There is no checking in this line. Mars in\ndetriment. The vanity to see transformation as a personal achievement rather than a socially supported or natural phenomenon.\n\nWhat you have here is: The potential gift of conceptualizing spontaneously. \"I have this new melody.\"\nBecause there is no introspection and because you just project that out, somebody will say to you, \"That is not new.\" That is a big crash for the 24.2's. \"What do you mean? It is my melody.\" \"That song was\nrecorded in 1972. I have it at home. This song of yours is plagiarism.\" All second lines get into trouble because they are always projecting, without the introspection to go with it.\n\nOn the other side: The mental vanity that such a gift can produce. \"I don't care what you say. It is my melody. I know that it is mine.\"\n\n24.3 The Addict\n\nThis is the line of adaptation. Here, the resonance from both the emotional side and the splenic side is bonds made and broken. This becomes very difficult. It becomes a hooking into and a snapping out of the\nknowing process. This can be very difficult because, after all, this gate is called Returning. It is about going through the process of figuring out what is knowable, what you can know, and what is worth\nknowing.\n\nThis line is called The Addict. The powerful attraction of regressive forms. Venus exalted. The ultimate though difficult triumph over regression. Jupiter in detriment. Addiction and regression legitimized by\nsuccess.\n\nThe third line has the capacity to reach out to the other side, though it can be very irresponsible in the way it does that. The 24.3 wants the 61. That is all. It keeps on hooking into the inspiration of the 61 and then\nbreaks the bond with the inspiration. After a while, this becomes very irrational because there is no real work at making it rational. It is irresponsible, after all. It does not matter whether that \"I know\" is\nknowable or not. \"I know the name of God.\" That can bring a lot of success to somebody. \"I am the son of\nGod. I will tell you about it.\" It is irrational because we cannot know that name. At the same time, success can legitimize that kind of illusion. \"I know what is unknowable.\" That can be something that gets\njustified by success.\n\nPage 2\n\nThese individuals have an enormously difficult time because when you meet a 24.3 and if they do get to the throat naturally through the 43/23, their ability to explain themselves is deeply limited and they end\nup sounding like abstract people. They end up asking you to believe them. They are just interested in the constant flow of inspiration. They are looking for the other side and they try to rationalize it for a moment\nand then they go over to the next thing. They can be very good at debunking people. When they are mature, they can recognize false knowers. They are very valuable for that. They know who is just making\na show to get other people's attention.\n\n24.4 The Hermit\n\nThe externalization process in this line is the most anti-social of all mental processes. The individual's primary goal is to preserve its integrity. The individual mind is not there to be influenced. That is why it\nis so obsessed with checking whether it has been influenced or not. It is there to be original and mutative as a force. When you get to the line of The Hermit, the fixedness of this line is, \"Don't influence me.\" It is\nalways trying to keep influences away and tends to be the kind of mind that works best when it is alone.\n\nTransformation that can only take place in isolation. Saturn exalted. The discipline and focus that assures renewal. Neptune in detriment. The tendency in isolation to live in a fantasy world. That living in a\nfantasy world is not a negative. It can be deeply creative.\n\nAloneness enriches the potential for rational thought; and Aloneness encourages the potential of illusion or delusion. Aloneness is a keynote here. They are fixed on being alone. The only way that you can get to\nthese people is through the brotherhood/sisterhood, through kindness that can end up as meanness. After a long time, they may tell you what they know and they may listen to what you say. For them to be able to\ncome to a rational point in their process, they need to be alone. I always tell these people the same thing.\n\"Be alone. Work out your knowing alone.\"\n\n24.5 Confession\n\nThe fifth line is the penultimate of a hexagram. It is the part of the hexagram that is the universal element of whether the nature of the hexagram is really there to go into the world.\n\nConfession. The courage to admit the mistakes of the past. One thing to recognize about the nature of knowers is that what the knower knows at any given moment can mutate and a new knowing can replace\nit. That is either a natural process that is taken in stride, the knower getting a new knowing, or it can become full of all kinds of problems psychically: \"I know this now but the reason that I did not know it\nbefore is that I had a problem before with this person. I was not trained properly. I was not given enough information.\"\n\nMoon exalted. The practical value of starting with a clean slate, symbolized by the new Moon. Mars in detriment. The tendency to try to minimize past mistakes through rationalization, turning confession into\njustification. The most important thing for a knower is to be able to say, \"I made a mistake. I did not know. I thought I knew but I didn't. Now I know.\" This is very, very important for the knowing process.\nThis is part of what the seduction is.\n\nThe nature of this confession is: Rational correction that opens the way to new possibilities. \"I did not know before but now I know.\" Now there is a new possibility that is waiting.\n\nOn the other side: Irrational justification of past mistakes. Because the knower is always trying to attract attention, they always put their knowing out there. They come and tell you something and two weeks\n\nPage 3\n\nlater, they come back to you and say, \"This is wrong.\" Then they make up all these excuses why they did not know it in the first place. This can become obsessive. That knowing can be transformed.\n\nThe moment that there is mutation, there is a new knowing that comes along. This is a natural process but it means that at the heart of every knower is the capacity to confess. This says a great deal about the fact\nthat in the 20/10 and the 25/51, which are both mystical channels that are part of the individuality process, there is a need to confess that they did not know. I know; I have been in that process myself. I was an\nenormously arrogant man who denied all kinds of mystical and supernatural phenomena. I did not only debunk it, I defamed it. The reality is that I had to confess to myself that I did not know. I was ignorant.\nNow I know. Now I have a new possibility.\n\nThis is one of the important things in the process of an individual: to accept that one did not know. Think about the resonance: the second line goes out and says, \"I have a new melody.\" This fifth line will go out\nand say, \"You were right. I made a mistake. It was not my melody. It was that old melody you told me about.\" This is what makes the knower acceptable. The moment that the knower cannot make the\nconfession of not knowing, they are no longer acceptable. They will no longer be tolerated and these are the individuals that will really get hurt by the outside, being alienated from the outside. They will really\nbe the freaks that get rejected. By the way, the fifth line of the abstract mind was The Saint, and here we have the Confession.\n\n24.6 The Gift Horse\n\nThe sixth line is the line of transition which is moving towards the next step, to the 2. 1 , where the driver is. It goes directly into an individual process.\n\nThis is the recognition of what is sterile and what is not. The Gift horse. The possibility of being deaf when opportunity knocks. For the sixth line, it is not important whether it can know something or not, or\nknow something which is knowable or unknowable. What is important here is mutation. It is the only thing that is important to the sixth line. Mutation here goes directly to the magnetic monopole (from the\n24.6 to the 2.1). It goes directly to direction, to bringing the mutation out as a direction for life and the possibility is that they are going be deaf. They won't hear it.\n\nJupiter exalted. The conscious participation in a process that prepares one for easy identification of opportunity. The other side is: Innate suspicion which leads inevitably to lost opportunities. The 24.6 can\nalways work on the knowing and thus, they can be very good thinkers. None of that thinking is of any value to them unless there is something inside of them that says, \"Aha, this can lead to mutation.\" Often,\nthey look like they are missing something, that they do not really see it. The fact is: they do. They just know if something will not get to mutation. When I say they know that, remember that they may know in\nthat moment and it may not be so, but nonetheless that is their knowing.\n\nIdentification and focus with the rational thought process; or Ohen irrational suspicion that distorts the focus and can lead to missed opportunities. The suspicion is about whether the knowing will mutate. It is\njust not about whether it can be known. These are deep knowers. They are very clear people. What they are concerned about is the only thing that will make it worthwhile. Remember the 28.6, Blaze of glory.\nYou can be suicidal in that. The only thing that makes it worthwhile, the only thing worth knowing is something that is really leading to mutation and a new direction. If they don't get it in their lives, they can\nbe very depressed, constantly ignoring opportunities that are brought to them and of course, the moment that you see a line that talks about missed opportunities, you know it means that they have all kinds of\nopportunities in their life. Opportunities will always come.\n\nPage 4\n\nThe nature in this sixth line is that it is looking for the mutation. What I tell these people is that only the things that they do click to are the things that are of value to them. I tell them not to worry about all those\nmissed opportunities. They do. This is Returning. They go back and say, \"Maybe that one could have mutated.\"\n\nThere is a resonance here to the third line, The Addict. The addict gets an enormous amount of inspiration. They are always sucking it in and then they break the bond. What happens to the sixth line is\nthat, early in their life, they jump a lot. They can because they know. They jump a lot and discover very quickly that it is not easy to get things into mutation. That leads them to take their distance. Once they\nhave been burnt, they really back off and wait for their opportunity, for the one that really does it for them.\n\nPage 5",

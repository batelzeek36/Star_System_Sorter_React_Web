The\nwhole thing about this is recognizing that the fundamental strength is the foundation itself. First, you have to have the foundation and only from the foundation can refinement come. So, if you are an immigrant\nand you are coming to a new land, to a new consciousness, the first thing is that you have to be able to plant yourself somewhere and begin this process of establishing a foundation, and then the refinement can\nbegin. If you come out of great poverty, something we witnessed in America, and arrive in North\nAmerica, you will not be able to drive around in a Cadillac until you spend a long time establishing your foundation and slowly refining the nature, so that you can fit into the culture around.\n\nVenus in detriment. A dissatisfaction with or embarrassment with origins that makes an obsession of refinement. This can be difficult. That is, you are uncomfortable with the foundation that you have and\nyou become obsessed with correcting, fixing or refining that.\n\nMars exalted. The awareness that the growth and refinement of values will benefit destiny. This is the encouragement that all first line people need. I have 10 first lines in my chart. I was stupid for 38 years. It\ntakes a long time when you have a lot of first lines to be able to develop the potential so that the refinement can come out, but it says something else to you. It benefits destiny. The moment that you\nrecognize where your first lines are, you can also see that those are aspects in your nature that are not easily transferable outwards until you've really built your foundation. Those are areas in you that you\nneed to focus on. These are areas that require patience and time before the refinement can come.\n\nA dissatisfaction with original values that demands refinement. Same process as in the Rove I'Ching.\nThink about this in terms of the law because all law began this way. This is the beginning of what we call our moral codes. This is the line of Moses, of Hammurabi. This is the line of establishing the original\ncode. This is the first law. It may be very primitive and needs to be refined.\n\nPage 1\n\nIn the 60's in Montreal, they decided that it was time because the city was French and it operated under the Napoleonic Code, and there were things they wanted to remove from the Code, such as the law about\ntying up your horse on the main street. These kinds of things. You have these old laws and, once you've established the foundation of civility in the society, you can begin to refine the law. This is the beginning\nof the legal process. You have a moral code which is your foundation and then you begin to refine that code to ultimately establish the law for civilization.\n\nWhen you have a judge sitting in a court and he has the first line, he is likely to be the kind of person who will go into their introspection and say, \"Yes, in this particular case, perhaps the law could be refined to\nallow you this particular difference of yours.\" This is the nature of the line. It doesn't just say, \"This is it.\"\nIt looks into it and whatever it sees that is weak, it tries to strengthen.\n\nThe reverse is also true. There are many people who see what is strong and try to weaken it. I am breaking the law since I was 13 years old. I have been smoking cannabis since I was 13. So wherever I\ngo, I am breaking the law. There are many people who would like to take that strong law and make it weak. There is always the other side through introspection. You look at that and say, \"This needs to be\nrefined. Let's take the strong and make it weak.\" It does not just go one way. This is a frequency and, depending on circumstances, it is either the weakness that needs to be refined or the strength that needs to\nbe refined."

The strength derived from maintaining one's values in the face of\nopposition or conditioning. This is already telling you that if you have this line, you will meet opposition.\nIt tells you that, no matter what your values are, there will always be adversity. This is the projecting out of a value that immediately creates confrontation with others. It will always provoke that. It will always\nbring that out.\n\nThe Venusian side: A discomfort with adversity that may lead to determined withdrawal. A lack of strength, where values are threatened by opposition or conditioning. The emotional wave of that is the\nwave of advance and withdrawal. On the emotional side, this is all about shyness and boldness. This is about projecting this field out which always brings some kind of reaction. These are values that do not\nhave a real foundation. There are simply values that are being projected outwards.\n\nWe have a classic example of that in Serbia. You have a vote that takes place and then you have the government that says, very determined, \"No. This has to be cancelled. We remain with our values, and\nnot with yours.\" You immediately get opposition.\n\nTwo things happen: either you are bold and you try, as the Prima Donna, to put your wave on somebody, or the moment you put it out there and there is all this adversity, you withdraw. These people can be very\nbitter. All second lines can ring with bitterness. It is not their fault. This is what they are here for: to project out and the moment they project it out, somebody smacks them for it. It immediately brings that\nadversity out.\n\nThe nature about the determination in the second line is both to project your value out and to be able to handle the adversity and, at the same time, to project it out and then withdraw from the adversity. These\nare all unstable laws and values. What is remarkable about these people is their determination. They get the first chance to look out of the window and they are very determined to get to the other side.\n\nPage 2"

      "heading": "Adaptability",
      "raw": "A judge that makes these laws: they will always be broken. They will demand being broken. There will always be something in that that somebody will have to break. Adaptability. The awareness that to\nmaintain one's principles and values, the support of others is necessary. Now, this is what we would call making laws in constitutional assemblies, where everybody gathers around and there are all kinds of\npeople that have their own personal interest in what kind of laws they want to see incorporated into the total law. You will always have the situation where you try to find a way to say, \"Okay, you will go along\nwith this law. You will not break it.\" These are laws that are trying to adapt to circumstances and they are laws that either fade off of the books or laws that get easily broken because they are usually an adaptation\nfor one interest rather than another.\n\nOn the other side you have: Discomfort with the awareness that one cannot stand alone by one's principles. This is where the gate wakes up and says, \"Oh, I have to deal with the creatures at the other\nside. This means that I can't be me. I have to do something with them. I have to adapt and work this out with them so that we can live together within the law.\"\n\nWherever you see the third line in your design, you are looking at the part of you that is actually aware of the fact that you are not alone. That is very nice to know and it is very important this recognition in us,\n\"Oh, I am going to have to adapt to others.\" Some of us, in our third lines, are going to be very uncomfortable with that. Why do I have to adapt to others? The other side is this sense of, \"If I have to\nadapt to others, I have to learn how to deal with them.\" Lower trigrams are very poor at being able to work well with others. It does not mean they can't nor does it mean that they cannot be of enormous\nvalue. In terms of being clear with each other in any kind of relationship, first, second and third lines are having trouble because they are working on what they are, and not on what the other one is. Only when\nyou get to the third line, you begin this process.\n\nIn the black book: the Moon exalted. When unable to make it alone will naturally align itself with nurturing and protective forces. This was Grace Kelly's line. A resentment when its natural mental gifts\nare ignored and is forced to curry favor in order to survive. In other words, \"This law, your highness, is terrible.\" \"Shut up, it is the law.\" Even if you know that it is bad for the people, even though you know\nthat it is not the right thing to do, you end up having to say, \"Yes, Sir\" because you have to adapt. This is all about having to recognize, \"Oh, my goodness, I have to deal with them. Otherwise, it will not work.\"\nThat can be very beautiful, or very uncomfortable. And again, to see that in terms of all third lines. Keep that in mind. It is an archetype for all of them."

      "heading": "Corruption",
      "raw": "This can be a deeply corruptive force. Remember that this is the gate of values. You have your one little aspect and you will go right down that line with it and you externalize it, come hell or high water. That\ncan be corruptive to others, or you can be corrupted in your fixed narrow path that you are going down.\n\nThe nature of these lines is awareness. The third line has an intuition for knowing when to adapt, and to whom. It is an intuition, a gift. The gift of the fourth line is the intuition to smell corruption, to know who\nis corrupt and who is corruptible. Before you can get to that point you have to be corrupted yourself and you have to see your own corruptibility. That is part of the process. In and of itself, this is no more\npositive or negative than any other terminology. It is simply a process.\n\nKeep in mind that instinct is about the nose, and intuition is about the ears. When you are dealing with anything having to do with the nature of the intuition, to recognize when one needs to adapt or not, or the\nintuition for corruption or not, it is what you hear.\n\nPage 3\n\nWhen you look here at the fourth line, in the Rave I'Ching it says: Corruption. A lack of enriching values.\nThe first thing to see in that is the nature of resonance. First and fourth lines have a resonance to each other. We saw that the first line was The Immigrant who has no values, in that sense. He comes to the\nnew land, has to find its foundation, develop it and refine its values. When you get to the resonance in the fourth line, there are no values. It is the same process. It is just at another level.\n\nThe malefic gift of turning inferior values into material success. Given this position, Saturn's exaltation is that its actions are limited to selfishness and unsavoriness rather than criminality. This is about being\nfocused down this one-track. Because of that, you will do anything to externalize it. There is no adaptation here. There is the need to externalize. You want to build your plant in Indonesia and you\nwould like to do it all legally, but you can't. You have to externalize that dream of yours. Otherwise you never make the millions you want to make. So you go ahead and deal with inferior elements. You say,\n\"How much do I have to bribe you to get that license? What will it cost me? As long as I have my one- track, I am willing to be corrupt here and there, as long as I can keep on externalizing.\" That is why, at the\nmaterial level, that works really well: the greasing of palms. This is a judge you can buy off. It can also be a judge who says, \"You can't buy me. I used to be available but now I am not available.\"\n\nMars in detriment. With such energy and no traditional values, the worst can be expected. The worst to expect here is when you are corrupt, you get caught. In getting found out, you get the opprobrium of the\ntribe. The tribe looks at you and says, \"This is a bad one. This is a Mafiosi, a gangster.\"\n\nThe capacity to maintain one's strength despite inferior values. The strength is: I am going to externalize this value, whatever it is. The weakness lies in the fact that, because you are so caught up in having to\nexternalize that, you pay. You will be corrupted simply to be able to get your way through them.\n\nOn the other side: The potential disregard of values that may lead to corruption or the breakdown of defense. You are so one-tracked, \"I am going to be a super vegetarian. Nothing is going to stop me. This\nis my intuition,\" and you may end up with a vitamin B deficiency that kills you; and \"It really seems like this is my direction. This is what I will do. This is my one-track-mind. Nothing will take me away from\nthis single track,\" and then you can be deeply corrupted. Not necessarily in your track, but all around you.\n\nRecently, an Italian company in the whole 'dirty-hands-business' in Italy, had all of these scandals. They were paying bribes and they could not list the bribes in their books. So the books were distorted and, due\nto that, the assets and the values of the company were distorted, and how much money they were actually making was distorted. When this all finally came out, they were sued by the stock market and\nshareholders because all of that was false.\n\nYou see that you can end up with this chain reaction. You do your little corruption on the side here because it works and the whole thing keeps on snowballing until it blows up in your face. The fourth line\nis brotherhood/sisterhood and the wave of kindness/meanness. All fourth lines are inherently corrupt. All of them are trying to get out their fixed line and, in trying to do that, they are willing to make\ncompromises and are willing to do things that are not necessarily of value to them."

      "heading": "Consistency",
      "raw": "The fifth line is called Consistency. When continuity has brought success, it should not be hampered with.\nSaturn exalted. The disciplined and natural conservatism to avoid unnecessary change. Mars in detriment.\nA perverse reaction to rebel against the methodology of one's very success. Neither one of those is about good or bad. This is the completion of a hexagram process and therefore, you come to the point in the\nfifth line where you recognize that what has worked shall remain. So, you have a law that says, \"Thou\n\nPage 4\n\nshalt not kill,\" and it is consistent and you want to keep that consistency but, at the same time, because you are at the completion of a process, you can see that what brought success in the past will not\nnecessarily bring the same success in the future. You can rebel against the very thing that brought success. These are the only judges that can really change our codes. They are the only ones that can\nlegitimately change the values in the tribe. They speak from a perspective in which they have gone through the process.\n\nWhen I say that: if you have a fifth line, genetically you are already equipped at that level. It is already there, as an essence. That process is already complete. Wherever you carry the fifth line, you have the\ncompletion in your hexagram process and in that, you are either going to have the discipline to maintain that, whatever direction it is bringing you, or you recognize that although it brought success in the past, it\nhas to be changed.\n\nThe conservative awareness that basic principles should not be abandoned casually. You notice that it does not say that you can't abandon them. It says that it shouldn't be abandoned casually. The nature of\nthe fifth line is, \"All right. This is what I am. I am not easily going to allow that to change.\"\n\nBut then you come to the other side: When effectively stimulated, the drive to rebel against basic principles. When there is enough evidence, when there is enough to stimulate that recognition, then those\nprinciples can be changed.\n\nEverything that I say to you about the nature of these lines, I am saying to you in the awareness that we work in mechanics together. At the mundane level, this can be very perverse. Somebody who is not aware\nof it, somebody who has a job and they are doing it very well and it is successful for them, and they have the fifth line: they may just as likely quit. Simply because, yes, it brought success, but what is next? What\nelse is there? Let me do something else. This is the mundane level of it.\n\nThe aware level of it is to recognize that one cannot abandon that casually. Yes, if there is enough stimulation, it may make sense in that way. Speaking of stimulation, it is a very abstract term. It may\nmake sense in that way to be able to say, \"All right, it is time to change this principle.\" The key here is consistency. After all, the fifth line is always going to speak for what is the essence of a hexagram, and\nthat consistency is necessary for us."

      "raw": "Every sixth line has the capacity to lead or not. If you look at all of them very carefully, you see that they are of enormous importance to us in our process. Here we have Leadership. Venus exalted. The gift in a\nposition of power to maintain harmony even in severity. The Moon in detriment. An inherent moodiness that in a position of power may at times alienate or offend and affect overall efficiency.\n\nIn the white book: The strength to maintain one's values with vigor and continue to have harmonic relationships with others. If you hold on to that value of transition, you are looking for the transition. You\nare able to deal with people but it does not mean that anything is going to happen. It does not mean that you lead them, or not. It does not mean that you will play the role of the leader. You will only do so if it is\nmore than just leading people across the river. \"If I just have to lead you across the river, why don't you get a boy scout? If you want to take me to the land of the universe, terrific: I will lead.\"\n\nThe other side is: The strength to maintain one's values but at the expense of harmonic relationships.\n\"Yes, I know that you would like to have me. Tough, I am looking for what is beyond.\" That is the sixth line and it can offend people in that way. Not only that, so often people want sixth lines to lead them, and\nthey refuse to be leaders. After all, this has to do with an emotional resonance of sympathy and apathy. I\n\nPage 5\n\nam deeply apathetic about being a leader. I have a lot of sixth line and third line resonances. The sixth line is not about automatically saying, \"This sixth line leads.\"\n\nThe sixth line itself is not in the business of propagandizing the hexagram. That is the fifth line. The sixth line is saying, \"Yes, okay, I don't want to lead you because I don't want to go there.\" What happens to\nthem is that they have difficulties in their relationships. At one level, they can be harmonic because people will recognize and are interested in and attracted to the sixth line because it takes them some place\nelse, but on the other hand, due to that apathy that is built into them, they have a taste for when to lead and whom to lead, or not.\n\nOne person can come up to me and ask me to lead him, and I refuse. Another person can come up with exactly the same request and I say, \"Yes.\" That is the nature of the sixth line. It is not universal. It is\ndeeply selective at that level and it comes from a position of power. This intrinsic power that lies here and all sixth lines that say, \"Yes, I have accomplished all these five steps. I have all that in my background. I\nam at the end of this process. I am looking for something else. Don't bog me down. Don't hold me here. I am going to the next line.\" The next line is the 28.1, Preparation, the desire to be effective. That is what\nthe leadership is looking for.\n\nPage 6"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 50 THE CAULDRON\n\nThe root of awareness. The 50th gate is, in that sense, where all awareness is nurtured because it is, like the sixth gate, a gate of fusion. It fuses all the processes that are going through the splenic center: the\nstream of taste, the collective logical process, the stream of intuition, the individual process and the stream of instinct, the tribal process. Each of those three streams is rooted in the 50th gate which produces\nan awareness frequency. The sixth gate produces an emotional wave. There are six of them.\n\nThese six awareness frequencies are at the beginning of our awareness process and literally the root of it.\nThe 50th gate, The Cauldron (a nice image, this big melting pot of all these different possibilities), is the gate of values which establishes the law within the tribe, which, in essence, is the law and the values of\nour cultures and our civilization. This is our oldest and most ancient awareness. Here, in the 50th gate are the frequencies that lead to what we call awareness.\n\nThe gate of values. The potential here is to be responsible, or not. Every single gate out of the splenic system is a gate of primal fear. The primary fear of the 50th gate and the fear that is at the heart of all\nawareness is the fear of responsibility. The potential here is to be responsible or not, and the awareness potential is values. This is the tribal law giver. The laws of the tribe are rooted in this existential\nawareness. This is the channel of the law. It establishes the law in the tribe, in the community and in the culture. One of the things to recognize very clearly in the way in which we come together in our\ncivilization is that this is all being dictated by the frequencies that originate in this 50th gate: the world we live in, the lives that we share with each other and the way that we share those lives.\n\n50.1 The Immigrant\n\nThe Immigrant.

Because of that, you will do anything to externalize it. There is no adaptation here. There is the need to externalize. You want to build your plant in Indonesia and you\nwould like to do it all legally, but you can't. You have to externalize that dream of yours. Otherwise you never make the millions you want to make. So you go ahead and deal with inferior elements. You say,\n\"How much do I have to bribe you to get that license? What will it cost me? As long as I have my one- track, I am willing to be corrupt here and there, as long as I can keep on externalizing.\" That is why, at the\nmaterial level, that works really well: the greasing of palms. This is a judge you can buy off. It can also be a judge who says, \"You can't buy me. I used to be available but now I am not available.\"\n\nMars in detriment. With such energy and no traditional values, the worst can be expected. The worst to expect here is when you are corrupt, you get caught. In getting found out, you get the opprobrium of the\ntribe. The tribe looks at you and says, \"This is a bad one. This is a Mafiosi, a gangster.\"\n\nThe capacity to maintain one's strength despite inferior values. The strength is: I am going to externalize this value, whatever it is. The weakness lies in the fact that, because you are so caught up in having to\nexternalize that, you pay. You will be corrupted simply to be able to get your way through them.\n\nOn the other side: The potential disregard of values that may lead to corruption or the breakdown of defense. You are so one-tracked, \"I am going to be a super vegetarian. Nothing is going to stop me. This\nis my intuition,\" and you may end up with a vitamin B deficiency that kills you; and \"It really seems like this is my direction. This is what I will do. This is my one-track-mind. Nothing will take me away from\nthis single track,\" and then you can be deeply corrupted. Not necessarily in your track, but all around you.\n\nRecently, an Italian company in the whole 'dirty-hands-business' in Italy, had all of these scandals. They were paying bribes and they could not list the bribes in their books. So the books were distorted and, due\nto that, the assets and the values of the company were distorted, and how much money they were actually making was distorted. When this all finally came out, they were sued by the stock market and\nshareholders because all of that was false.\n\nYou see that you can end up with this chain reaction. You do your little corruption on the side here because it works and the whole thing keeps on snowballing until it blows up in your face. The fourth line\nis brotherhood/sisterhood and the wave of kindness/meanness. All fourth lines are inherently corrupt. All of them are trying to get out their fixed line and, in trying to do that, they are willing to make\ncompromises and are willing to do things that are not necessarily of value to them.\n\n50.5 Consistency\n\nThe fifth line is called Consistency. When continuity has brought success, it should not be hampered with.\nSaturn exalted. The disciplined and natural conservatism to avoid unnecessary change. Mars in detriment.\nA perverse reaction to rebel against the methodology of one's very success. Neither one of those is about good or bad. This is the completion of a hexagram process and therefore, you come to the point in the\nfifth line where you recognize that what has worked shall remain. So, you have a law that says, \"Thou\n\nPage 4\n\nshalt not kill,\" and it is consistent and you want to keep that consistency but, at the same time, because you are at the completion of a process, you can see that what brought success in the past will not\nnecessarily bring the same success in the future. You can rebel against the very thing that brought success. These are the only judges that can really change our codes. They are the only ones that can\nlegitimately change the values in the tribe. They speak from a perspective in which they have gone through the process.\n\nWhen I say that: if you have a fifth line, genetically you are already equipped at that level. It is already there, as an essence. That process is already complete. Wherever you carry the fifth line, you have the\ncompletion in your hexagram process and in that, you are either going to have the discipline to maintain that, whatever direction it is bringing you, or you recognize that although it brought success in the past, it\nhas to be changed.\n\nThe conservative awareness that basic principles should not be abandoned casually. You notice that it does not say that you can't abandon them. It says that it shouldn't be abandoned casually. The nature of\nthe fifth line is, \"All right. This is what I am. I am not easily going to allow that to change.\"\n\nBut then you come to the other side: When effectively stimulated, the drive to rebel against basic principles. When there is enough evidence, when there is enough to stimulate that recognition, then those\nprinciples can be changed.\n\nEverything that I say to you about the nature of these lines, I am saying to you in the awareness that we work in mechanics together. At the mundane level, this can be very perverse. Somebody who is not aware\nof it, somebody who has a job and they are doing it very well and it is successful for them, and they have the fifth line: they may just as likely quit. Simply because, yes, it brought success, but what is next? What\nelse is there? Let me do something else. This is the mundane level of it.\n\nThe aware level of it is to recognize that one cannot abandon that casually. Yes, if there is enough stimulation, it may make sense in that way. Speaking of stimulation, it is a very abstract term. It may\nmake sense in that way to be able to say, \"All right, it is time to change this principle.\" The key here is consistency. After all, the fifth line is always going to speak for what is the essence of a hexagram, and\nthat consistency is necessary for us.\n\n50.6 Leadership\n\nEvery sixth line has the capacity to lead or not. If you look at all of them very carefully, you see that they are of enormous importance to us in our process. Here we have Leadership. Venus exalted. The gift in a\nposition of power to maintain harmony even in severity. The Moon in detriment. An inherent moodiness that in a position of power may at times alienate or offend and affect overall efficiency.\n\nIn the white book: The strength to maintain one's values with vigor and continue to have harmonic relationships with others. If you hold on to that value of transition, you are looking for the transition. You\nare able to deal with people but it does not mean that anything is going to happen. It does not mean that you lead them, or not. It does not mean that you will play the role of the leader. You will only do so if it is\nmore than just leading people across the river. \"If I just have to lead you across the river, why don't you get a boy scout? If you want to take me to the land of the universe, terrific: I will lead.\"\n\nThe other side is: The strength to maintain one's values but at the expense of harmonic relationships.\n\"Yes, I know that you would like to have me. Tough, I am looking for what is beyond.\" That is the sixth line and it can offend people in that way. Not only that, so often people want sixth lines to lead them, and\nthey refuse to be leaders. After all, this has to do with an emotional resonance of sympathy and apathy. I\n\nPage 5\n\nam deeply apathetic about being a leader. I have a lot of sixth line and third line resonances. The sixth line is not about automatically saying, \"This sixth line leads.\"\n\nThe sixth line itself is not in the business of propagandizing the hexagram. That is the fifth line. The sixth line is saying, \"Yes, okay, I don't want to lead you because I don't want to go there.\" What happens to\nthem is that they have difficulties in their relationships. At one level, they can be harmonic because people will recognize and are interested in and attracted to the sixth line because it takes them some place\nelse, but on the other hand, due to that apathy that is built into them, they have a taste for when to lead and whom to lead, or not.\n\nOne person can come up to me and ask me to lead him, and I refuse. Another person can come up with exactly the same request and I say, \"Yes.\" That is the nature of the sixth line. It is not universal. It is\ndeeply selective at that level and it comes from a position of power. This intrinsic power that lies here and all sixth lines that say, \"Yes, I have accomplished all these five steps. I have all that in my background. I\nam at the end of this process. I am looking for something else. Don't bog me down. Don't hold me here. I am going to the next line.\" The next line is the 28.1, Preparation, the desire to be effective. That is what\nthe leadership is looking for.\n\nPage 6",

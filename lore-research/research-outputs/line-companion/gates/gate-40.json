The first three lines are not socially gifted. First lines are\nonly interested in the foundation. They themselves tend to be invisible. In other words, they are the kind of ego you can't find to tell them that the refrigerator is empty. They are out in the backyard somewhere\nhaving a snooze. They don't want to have anything to do with that. While they are lying there, they are trying to figure out if willpower is something of value in the first place.\n\nThe first line, which always represents the essence of any hexagram, is called Recuperation. It tells you what the ego requires. It can only be used for so long and then it must have its rest. If you look at any\nkind of long-term relationship of couples where the man comes home from work and just throws himself on the sofa and turns on the TV and blares out his brain, and there is this whole list of things that he could\nbe doing. You can't ask him. If you do that, it will create problems because that willpower is also ego.\n\"Don't bother me now.\" The ego must have its rest. When you give it its rest, everything works.\n\nThe ability to relax and enjoy the fruits of one's labors. Whenever I see somebody with this line, I always remind them of one thing: Your friends are only of value to you as long as they don't take you aside and\nsay, \"Excuse me, you really have a problem.\" For this kind of person, friendship is not having people tell them that they have a problem that their willpower has to deal with, that they have to go out and do\nsomething about. They just want to be able to relax. They will do their work if you let them relax. They need to relax.\n\nPage 2\n\nThis is true for the stomach. It is very important for any human being to understand the nature of nutrition. You cannot eat if you are not hungry anymore than willpower can be used if it is not the right\ntime and the person who has that capacity does not want to be involved in that process. This is devastating for the system. It is extremely unhealthy and creates what people call ulcers. It creates all\nkinds of difficulties within the physical stomach itself.\n\nThe Moon is in detriment. The Moon cannot stand still. The whole thing about this is that this 40th gate, though it requires its rest, it cannot just rest. If it can rest when it comes home from work, it has to get up\nthe next day and go out into the world and do its thing. In the social context, these are people who do not stay with the same relationships in their lifetime. Their communities and families go through changes\nbecause what they are looking for is to be left in peace.\n\nIn the white book: The ego strength to enjoy being alone. The 40th gate says, \"I don't need you.\" This is not true. The 40th gate and the 26th gate are gates of denial. It is in their mechanism to say, \"Don't bother\nme now.\" In order to get the ego to do anything, you have to massage it. That is why this \"don't bother me\" is not true. Otherwise, it will say, \"I will stay alone,\" and the other says, \"Oh, no you can't. We really\nneed you. We have to have you. You are so important to us.\" They have to be pulled into the game.\n\nThe other side is: The ego uncomfortable with being alone too long. After the 40th gate had its rest, it says, \"Why isn't there anybody around being nice to me and asking me to go to work? And who needs\nme? Why doesn't somebody need met\" So, they are ready to look for somebody who will need them, so that their ego can be puffed up and they can go out and come back and say, \"Hey, don't bother me now.\nI'm getting my rest.\"",

      "heading": "Rigidity",
      "raw": "All first lines tell you about the intrinsic nature of a hexagram, and fifth lines tell you how everybody sees them. The ego is never seen by society as being something that is pleasant. The ego puts food in\ncivilization's mouth and yet, at the same time, the ego says, \"Keep a low profile. Don't show it too much because it is not a nice thing.\"\n\nThe fifth line here is called Rigidity. The projection onto this ego is that it is rigid. The overview line here shows that it is a lifelong process. The recognition that to achieve liberation... (to achieve your rest) ...all\nnegative forces must be rejected. The demands on the ego always have to be censored. The ego is standing there saying, \"What do you actually want from me? Tell me exactly. Then I know whether you\nare a positive or a negative force, so I know whether my will suits that. \"\n\nUranus exalted. The revolutionary who demands absolute victory. Absolute victory in this sense is, \"I do my thing when I want. And when I rest, leave me alone.\" Fifth lines in the 40 have great advantages in\n\nPage 5\n\nlife because people project on them that that is exactly what they are going to be like. They will be rigid.\nThis is what others project on them, \"This is a rigid ego. It will do its thing when it wants, and otherwise, it will do nothing.\" That is how society sees it.\n\nBy the way, it does not mean that that is true. You can see what happens in the detriment. Remember that the fifth line is in harmony to the second. In the second line, in the detriment, we saw the natural\npeacefulness that will let in the wrong force and have that wrong force pull it out of its aloneness. Here, the fifth line in the detriment is: A tendency in revolution to accept a certain amount of necessary\ndeviation on the assumption that it can be successfully purged later.\n\n'Let them keep on making that kind of demand on me because it is nice that they are here giving me this massage. But afterwards, I will teach them not to do that.\" It is typical of the 40's rigidity. The power of\nthe ego is maintained in the rejection of negative relationships. Remember, what is negative to the ego is simply anything that calls on it when it does not want to work. The ego is not an awareness. It is just a\nmotor. You can have a 40 sitting at the telephone and they get 5 calls from people. Four of them ask them to do things, and they just don't like the people and do not identify with the thing. Then the fifth call\ncomes and they say, \"I am ready,\" and off they go. They are ready to do it. It all depends on who is calling. This is what moves the world.\n\nThe weakness of the ego in its loneliness to maintain and not reject negative relationships. The ego is always vulnerable to its aloneness because it survives on the massage. Even though it needs to push the\nother away, it does not want to push them away too far. They want to make sure that they will be close enough later so that they can massage them again, so that they are ready to go back and do their thing.\nThis is the nature of the ego. People do not particularly like it.",

And when I rest, leave me alone.\" Fifth lines in the 40 have great advantages in\n\nPage 5\n\nlife because people project on them that that is exactly what they are going to be like. They will be rigid.\nThis is what others project on them, \"This is a rigid ego. It will do its thing when it wants, and otherwise, it will do nothing.\" That is how society sees it.\n\nBy the way, it does not mean that that is true. You can see what happens in the detriment. Remember that the fifth line is in harmony to the second. In the second line, in the detriment, we saw the natural\npeacefulness that will let in the wrong force and have that wrong force pull it out of its aloneness. Here, the fifth line in the detriment is: A tendency in revolution to accept a certain amount of necessary\ndeviation on the assumption that it can be successfully purged later.\n\n'Let them keep on making that kind of demand on me because it is nice that they are here giving me this massage. But afterwards, I will teach them not to do that.\" It is typical of the 40's rigidity. The power of\nthe ego is maintained in the rejection of negative relationships. Remember, what is negative to the ego is simply anything that calls on it when it does not want to work. The ego is not an awareness. It is just a\nmotor. You can have a 40 sitting at the telephone and they get 5 calls from people. Four of them ask them to do things, and they just don't like the people and do not identify with the thing. Then the fifth call\ncomes and they say, \"I am ready,\" and off they go. They are ready to do it. It all depends on who is calling. This is what moves the world.\n\nThe weakness of the ego in its loneliness to maintain and not reject negative relationships. The ego is always vulnerable to its aloneness because it survives on the massage. Even though it needs to push the\nother away, it does not want to push them away too far. They want to make sure that they will be close enough later so that they can massage them again, so that they are ready to go back and do their thing.\nThis is the nature of the ego. People do not particularly like it."

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 40 DELIVERANCE\n\nThe heart center and the Self are of enormous significance to us. The G center and the heart center are part of the most basic and primary infrastructure that is built within us. They both represent qualities that\nare often deeply confused: the relationship between the Self and the T. In looking at the ego gates and the gates of the G, we are going to distinguish very clearly between the natures of these two.\n\nIn dealing with the ego, a picture of the tribal circuitry gives an impression of the importance of the heart center and the ego in our mundane lives. It is absolutely essential for humanity to function out of its ego.\nThis is why we have civilizations and cultures (friendship is one of the best examples of this) that are always caught up in the ego, in how great they are, or have been.\n\nEgo is intrinsic to the nature of what the tribe is all about. Everything about tribal circuitry is rooted in the ego. More than that, the 51, which is missing in this picture of tribal circuitry, is also tribal even though it\nis deeply individual. As part of individual circuitry, it serves the tribe. It is directly connected to the tribe.\nThe way in which we are going to look at the heart center is through its two primary functions, which are willpower in the 40th gate leading to the 51st gate, and ego or the possessiveness of the T in the 26th gate\nleading to the 21st gate.\n\nThe heart center is very complex. It is obviously misunderstood. Egoism is something that is put down in the Eastern side of our world, this quality of the T and its possessiveness. When you are looking at the\nego, you are looking at a biological complexity that is unlike any other center that we have. We will look at these very important functions. Willpower begins with the stomach which is part of the heart center,\nlike the heart muscle itself which is in the 21 st gate, or the gall bladder which is in the 51 st gate, or the thymus gland which generates our immune system which is in the 26th gate. We have a very complex\ncenter here, in terms of how it moves its information out into the biological structure.\n\nThe stomach and the heart give you a deep insight into the nature of how the ego works. The ego, the will, can never work consistently. It is very important to grasp this. Willpower can only last so long under\ncertain circumstances and then it has to give up, in the same way that your heart needs to beat. It cannot hold the tone. There has to be the space in between. There has to be this moment of tension and then\nrelaxation. The same thing is true for the nature of the stomach. You cannot feed the stomach all day. It is not possible. The stomach needs to have its time of rest and then it needs to have its time of work. In\nunderstanding the nature of the ego, it is important to see that it is always looking for rest. This is something about the ego that is not really understood. It is not looking to go out and to shine, to send out\nits willpower. It is basically looking to rest until there is exactly the right timing to release that energy, so that the release of that energy is productive because the ego itself knows that it can only be active so long.\nIn other words, unless you really have the will, you are not able to climb that mountain.\n\nThe ego recognizes that it must have the resource and, at the same time, in order to get there, it knows that it has to rest. This makes the will something that is not always easy for others because it is unlike any of\nthe other motors. When you turn on the generator, you turn it on for life until death, frequency after frequency, on and on and on. When you turn on the emotional system, you have a lifelong wave. When\nyou turn of the adrenaline system, the pressure never goes away. It is constant. The thing about the ego is that it works and then it goes on vacation. That is the nature of the ego.\n\nThe ego mechanic, here, in the white book: A will or lack of will to provide for the needy. This is the role of the 40th gate. In English, Deliverance has several meanings: Jesus delivered people from their sins. To\nbe delivered is almost equivalent to being brought to satori, or enlightenment. To be delivered from evil is in the Lord's Prayer. Deliverance carries with it quite a substantial value as a mundane process: to be the\n\nPage 1\n\none that delivers is synonymous with being a breadwinner. If you deliver, you bring home the goods so that everybody can eat. Deliverance also has a high mystical and spiritual value to it.\n\nThe very name of this gate is what is really demanded of the ego. The tribe needs the ego to express its power. Willpower is something that does not operate in a fixed pattern. All of us know that by the way we\neat. You can be fairly regular in your eating but you can also have all kinds of variations that run in between. Only when the ego system builds up its proper readiness is it going to use that willpower. When\nthe willpower is there, its purpose is to provide for those who need. The byproduct of that is that the deliverer may in fact do well themselves, but the thing that drives their ego is the need of those who call\nupon it. This is classic in the nature of the 40/37, in the channel of Community, in terms of the marriage contract. This is the channel of the marriage contract in sexuality. The reality is that the 40 is expected to\ndeliver. The 40 and its ego is expected to go out there in the world and conquer the material plane and, in return, it will have its ego massaged.\n\nThe whole thing to understand about the 40th gate is that it is not the big powerful will. We find the strong will in the 51st gate. Rather, the 40 is the potential of will that can be built up or inflated by others.\nThe ego is simply lazy and basically wants to rest, \"Yes, I can do it but, please, I need my rest first before\nI will try that.\" Before the ego gets going, it has to have something on the other side that says, \"You are really wonderful,\" or \"There is nothing in the refrigerator and you have to go out and do something about\nit.\" The fact is that the ego needs to be worked on. If it does not get worked on, if it does not get massaged or pumped up, it says, \"Sorry, I am tired today and I don't feel like doing it. I will just sit here.\"\n\nAbove the lines, the key to everything about the 40th gate, it says: The point of transition between struggle and liberation. This is the whole business of understanding the ego. It has its time for struggle\nand then it has its required liberation, to be free of the struggle. No ego can stay with struggle. This is something so important to understand. You can only push will so far.\n\n40.1 Recuperation\n\nWhen we get to the beginning of any hexagram structure, we begin with the first line in the lower trigram.\nRemember that the lower trigram does not know that there is anything else at the other end of the channel.\nSo, they are not social and are quite surprised, even though it happens to be a social channel, the channel of the social marriage contract, in that sense. The first three lines are not socially gifted. First lines are\nonly interested in the foundation. They themselves tend to be invisible. In other words, they are the kind of ego you can't find to tell them that the refrigerator is empty. They are out in the backyard somewhere\nhaving a snooze. They don't want to have anything to do with that. While they are lying there, they are trying to figure out if willpower is something of value in the first place.\n\nThe first line, which always represents the essence of any hexagram, is called Recuperation. It tells you what the ego requires. It can only be used for so long and then it must have its rest. If you look at any\nkind of long-term relationship of couples where the man comes home from work and just throws himself on the sofa and turns on the TV and blares out his brain, and there is this whole list of things that he could\nbe doing. You can't ask him. If you do that, it will create problems because that willpower is also ego.\n\"Don't bother me now.\" The ego must have its rest. When you give it its rest, everything works.\n\nThe ability to relax and enjoy the fruits of one's labors. Whenever I see somebody with this line, I always remind them of one thing: Your friends are only of value to you as long as they don't take you aside and\nsay, \"Excuse me, you really have a problem.\" For this kind of person, friendship is not having people tell them that they have a problem that their willpower has to deal with, that they have to go out and do\nsomething about. They just want to be able to relax. They will do their work if you let them relax. They need to relax.\n\nPage 2\n\nThis is true for the stomach. It is very important for any human being to understand the nature of nutrition. You cannot eat if you are not hungry anymore than willpower can be used if it is not the right\ntime and the person who has that capacity does not want to be involved in that process. This is devastating for the system. It is extremely unhealthy and creates what people call ulcers. It creates all\nkinds of difficulties within the physical stomach itself.\n\nThe Moon is in detriment. The Moon cannot stand still. The whole thing about this is that this 40th gate, though it requires its rest, it cannot just rest. If it can rest when it comes home from work, it has to get up\nthe next day and go out into the world and do its thing. In the social context, these are people who do not stay with the same relationships in their lifetime. Their communities and families go through changes\nbecause what they are looking for is to be left in peace.\n\nIn the white book: The ego strength to enjoy being alone. The 40th gate says, \"I don't need you.\" This is not true. The 40th gate and the 26th gate are gates of denial. It is in their mechanism to say, \"Don't bother\nme now.\" In order to get the ego to do anything, you have to massage it. That is why this \"don't bother me\" is not true. Otherwise, it will say, \"I will stay alone,\" and the other says, \"Oh, no you can't. We really\nneed you. We have to have you. You are so important to us.\" They have to be pulled into the game.\n\nThe other side is: The ego uncomfortable with being alone too long. After the 40th gate had its rest, it says, \"Why isn't there anybody around being nice to me and asking me to go to work? And who needs\nme? Why doesn't somebody need met\" So, they are ready to look for somebody who will need them, so that their ego can be puffed up and they can go out and come back and say, \"Hey, don't bother me now.\nI'm getting my rest.\"\n\n40.2 Resoluteness\n\nWhen you are dealing with the second line, you are dealing with a light on inside the house and people can see in. Wherever you have the second line, you have to learn in life that other people see things in you\nthat you don't see yourself. The 40th hexagram is about aloneness in the ego sense, as we have seen. The ego requires its time for rest. It seeks to be alone so that it is not pulled on as an ego force. The second\nline does not know very much about being social and other people. Other people are walking by its house, looking through its window and they say, \"This one is alone, but this one can have a very strong will. If\nwe can get to this one, it is able to do something for us.\" All of a sudden, the 40 is surprised that there is somebody there that is pulling on their willpower.\n\nResoluteness. The power and authoriy in deliverance... (aloneness) ... to shed forever the qualities which hampered liberation. In other words, for the second line, aloneness is something that is very healthy. It is\ngood for them. After all, they don't know how to deal with the outside anyway, so they are stuck on the inside.\n\nWhen you come to the detriment, you have: A natural peacefulness that in deliverance may sympathize with and attempt to nurture the forces which hampered liberation. By the way, liberation is just a word for\nrest. It is better to be alone than having people around who constantly pull you into work. That is what this line is saying at its exalted side, but at its detriment side it is saying that one is defenseless in that\nmoment that people look inside, see that you have the will and come and get it.\n\nOne of the jokes about me is that my second line is a projection. I project out that I am alone, but it is actually not that difficult to come up to me and ask me something, to come into my aura. There are people\nwho know how to get in and take that.\n\nPage 3\n\nThe power through aloneness to recognize the importance and the potential disruptive effect of others.\n\"What they are going to get me into now?\" This is what you learn. All second lines collapse under recognition because this is what a second line is about. This is how they learn. All of a sudden, somebody\nsees something in you that you don't know is there. People are seeing in me that there is some chance to make a bargain, and I don't even know that is there. They can see that.\n\nThe other side is: The power of loneliness to blind the ego to the possible disruptive effect of others.\nWhen somebody gets in, because the second line doesn't know what to do with others, it is basically stuck, and it ends up getting pulled into things. The basic demand of the ego: \"Would you do me a favor?\"\nAnyone who is coming to the ego is coming for its will and its capacity to do things. The aloneness in this gate is all about saying, \"I'll be with you sometimes. But the rest of the time, leave me alone.\" Most of the\npeople think that is very personal. In other words, they take it as a psychological statement rather than what it is. It is a pure ego statement. Willpower can only work so much. What happens to the second line\nis that it really gets disrupted because they don't really know what is going on inside of them. They are just busy in their aloneness.\n\n40.3 Humility\n\nBefore you get to the Pluto exalted in this line, you have an overview statement that says: A calculated mode in deliverance to avoid attracting the attention of negative forces. Whenever you see an introduction\nin a line before the exalted and the detriment, that is telling you that you are dealing with a lifelong process, an ongoing process, and really is not something that is dealt with properly until one matures in\nlife. All third lines are lines of adaptation, and as such are lines of trial and error.\n\nIt will be, in this line of Humility, a trial and error process to find out about aloneness, and to find out in your aloneness how not to attract negative forces. It does not mean that you don't attract them. It actually\nmeans that you will attract negative forces until you finally learn: better to be alone than to have this one or that one in your life. Remember that this is fundamentally social and communal, so it really is about\nthe other in that sense.\n\nPluto exalted. The subtlety to enjoy deliverance... (being alone) ...without having to Haunt it. This is like not telling everybody, \"You have to work and I can rest. I have done mine.\" It is not about that. It is about\nenjoying your quiet time, your time between having to use the willpower.\n\nMars in detriment. The ego arrogance that demands attention and gets it. In the white book, it gives you a clear picture. It says: The capacity of the ego to avoid negative forces even if it means being alone. This is\nwhat the ego has to learn in the third line. It is better to be alone than to deal with negative forces.\n\nIn the detriment: The capacity of the ego to demand attention. And it gets it, which means that, literally, that ego ends up doing all kinds of things that it shouldn't, with the wrong influences in his life. It is so\nimportant to understand that the power of the will is dependant on the massage. If you have a 40 football team and you put them on the field where they are at home, and you have 40,000 people shouting their\nname, pumping them up, they will play better than if there are only ten people and they are all booing. In other words, the power of the will is always dependant on who is pulling on that will.\n\nThe 'negative forces' are those forces that do not allow that will to operate properly, or for that rest to be allowed in between. It is a trial and error process. It will take time in the life to develop that. They are\nbetter off alone than having to deal with negative forces. They are not better off alone in general. No ego can be alone forever. It must go out and do its business, but it is better to be alone than to be with negative\nforces. You have forces (other people) that say, \"I need you to do this. You have to work.\" If that ego does not have the power to do that, does not feel like doing that, does not have strength to do that, it is\n\nPage 4\n\ndealing with negative forces because they are pulling on it to do something that is not natural for them.\nThen it is better to be alone. Aloneness has to do with the stomach. You can only be alone so long before you go hungry. You have to feed yourself. You have to look after yourself. That is what the willpower is\nfor. In the third line, it is a learning process.\n\n40.4 Organization\n\nWith the fourth line, we come to the upper trigram, to a transpersonal process which is taking place in a social channel here. The fourth to sixth lines have specific social skills. Fourth lines are fixed and one-\npointed. They are unidirectional, one-tracked.\n\nThe fourth line here is: The power to transform and the intuitive intellect to select and organize for the purpose of maintaining deliverance. All this means is: when you know that there is another side, how\nmuch work do you have to give them to keep them happy and quiet so that they continue to massage your ego and you'll have your chance for rest? In other words, the more you have your life together on the\nmaterial plane, your job, your work, it is all very healthy. This is being organized. Being able to do your work and then having the time to be able to relax.\n\nThe Mars in detriment is different though. An uncontrollable zeal that ignores the quality of support in preference for the quantity, which in the long run may destabilize deliverance. These are people that drop\ndead from work. These are workaholics. We are dealing with a fourth line, so you are dealing with this fixed externalization. They are really onetracked. \"I will get my will out, and then I have to rest.\" When\nyou get to the detriment, it is all about, \"Oh, this one wants me. Okay, I will do this work. This one wants me; I will get my will out.\" As long as they keep on getting their ego massaged, it can be very dangerous.\n\nThe fourth line in the white book: The power of the ego when organized and active to maintain separateness. Organize actively, do your ego work, and pull away and have your rest. In the same way as\nhuman beings do when they eat, they should have a chance to rest afterwards. It is healthy for them. In\nSpain, they have these big 'siestas.' You eat, and then everything is closed and there is nothing to do for hours, and it is correct. This is great for the stomach.\n\nOn the other side: The empowering of the ego through the capacity to organize others. The more they get into that organization, the less time they have left. They are so busy dealing with using their will that they\ndon't take their rest. And again, this is something that is essential. We cannot overwork the ego. The more you overwork it, the less productive it becomes.\n\n40.5 Rigidity\n\nAll first lines tell you about the intrinsic nature of a hexagram, and fifth lines tell you how everybody sees them. The ego is never seen by society as being something that is pleasant. The ego puts food in\ncivilization's mouth and yet, at the same time, the ego says, \"Keep a low profile. Don't show it too much because it is not a nice thing.\"\n\nThe fifth line here is called Rigidity. The projection onto this ego is that it is rigid. The overview line here shows that it is a lifelong process. The recognition that to achieve liberation... (to achieve your rest) ...all\nnegative forces must be rejected. The demands on the ego always have to be censored. The ego is standing there saying, \"What do you actually want from me? Tell me exactly. Then I know whether you\nare a positive or a negative force, so I know whether my will suits that. \"\n\nUranus exalted. The revolutionary who demands absolute victory. Absolute victory in this sense is, \"I do my thing when I want. And when I rest, leave me alone.\" Fifth lines in the 40 have great advantages in\n\nPage 5\n\nlife because people project on them that that is exactly what they are going to be like. They will be rigid.\nThis is what others project on them, \"This is a rigid ego. It will do its thing when it wants, and otherwise, it will do nothing.\" That is how society sees it.\n\nBy the way, it does not mean that that is true. You can see what happens in the detriment. Remember that the fifth line is in harmony to the second. In the second line, in the detriment, we saw the natural\npeacefulness that will let in the wrong force and have that wrong force pull it out of its aloneness. Here, the fifth line in the detriment is: A tendency in revolution to accept a certain amount of necessary\ndeviation on the assumption that it can be successfully purged later.\n\n'Let them keep on making that kind of demand on me because it is nice that they are here giving me this massage. But afterwards, I will teach them not to do that.\" It is typical of the 40's rigidity. The power of\nthe ego is maintained in the rejection of negative relationships. Remember, what is negative to the ego is simply anything that calls on it when it does not want to work. The ego is not an awareness. It is just a\nmotor. You can have a 40 sitting at the telephone and they get 5 calls from people. Four of them ask them to do things, and they just don't like the people and do not identify with the thing. Then the fifth call\ncomes and they say, \"I am ready,\" and off they go. They are ready to do it. It all depends on who is calling. This is what moves the world.\n\nThe weakness of the ego in its loneliness to maintain and not reject negative relationships. The ego is always vulnerable to its aloneness because it survives on the massage. Even though it needs to push the\nother away, it does not want to push them away too far. They want to make sure that they will be close enough later so that they can massage them again, so that they are ready to go back and do their thing.\nThis is the nature of the ego. People do not particularly like it.\n\n40.6 Decapitation\n\nSixth lines are never part of the hexagram. They are sifting on the roof and because of that, they have a totally different perspective. The 40.6 perspective is more than just the gate at the other end of the\nchannel. It goes out to the entire circuit. It is looking at all of the possibilities that are there in the tribal circuitry. And more than that, the sixth line is moving in a track. The next thing that it is going to meet is\nthe 64.1. It is on its way to many different things. When it is sifting up there on the roof, you cannot expect it to respond in the way the rest of the lines do.\n\nThis sixth line is called Decapitation. It is an overview line; it is a lifelong process. Remember something about all sixth lines. Whatever the description of a sixth line is, you live it out quickly when you are\nyoung and then you avoid it almost entirely for the rest of your life. If you have the 59.6, you have a lot of one night stands until the age of 18 to 25, and then you never do it again. The fact of the matter is that\nwhat happens with sixth lines is that you live them out, but the moment you realize that you are not getting what you want out of that, it stops. The sixth line is a cosmic fence sitter.\n\nIn this image of the community or the family, think about what this line says. It says: The necessary destruction of inferior forces in positions of power before liberation can take place. This is about, who are\nthese people to make demands on the ego? You can imagine the 40.6 sitting on the roof of their house and looking into the garden and seeing their family there. They know which ones should be taken from power\nbecause they know exactly which ones put pressure on the will system that is not correct. They are inferior. They do not belong there. The will is an incredible thing if it is properly treated, but if not, it is a\nvery destructive thing.\n\nThe Sun exalted. The authority, coupled with the magnanimity to remove from power only those who deserve such drastic treatment. All of the language here in this hexagram was about 'negative forces'. The\n\nPage 6\n\nsixth line talks about 'inferior forces'. The demands that the negative forces make on the will are legitimate; they are just not particularly good for that will and so are only negative in that sense. But the\ninferior forces make demands that are unfair, unnecessary, and unreasonable. They are the ones that have to be removed from power and that is the gift of the sixth line in the 40.\n\nThe Earth in detriment. Exemplified by the terror of the French revolution, where the idea of who was deserving of punishment was cruelly extended to an entire class. We are dealing with the tribe here. \"How\ndare the state tax me until I am dead? I will kill those bastards because they are inferior and destroying my society, my family, my life. They are taxing my willpower to the point that I cannot function\nanymore.\" That is not about negative forces anymore. That is about inferior forces because they make claims and bargains with the will that are unfair. \"You go out and do that for me, darling, and I will give\nyou a reward.\" Then you go home and there is no reward. It is not fair, and the sixth line learns that very early. It climbs up to the top of the house and says, \"They have no right to tell me to do that.\"\n\nThe power and authority of the ego to reject individuals in legitimate defense of the group. If the ego is treated properly, everybody benefits. The other side is: The distortion of the ego through power and\nauthority. What is important for the 40.6 is that if you have a child with this line, you cannot create false bargains with them. You cannot make these deals that are famous in tribes. \"You take out the garbage and\nI do that.\" You'd better keep your word. Otherwise, you become an inferior force and they will cut off your head.\n\nPage 7",

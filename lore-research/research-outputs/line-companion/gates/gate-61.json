It is keeping that at the obvious level: that is the mystery. If you think of the children who have Neptune in 6 Neptune is veiling the\nmystery anyway. They don't know where that knowing comes from. There is still a mystery but the answer can come out, the knowing can come out but it comes out very mysteriously.\n\nVenus in detriment. Where reliance on secret knowledge increasingly demands ascetic withdrawal and leads eventually to obscurity. There is so much knowledge that has been lost. Whenever you hear\nsomebody saying, \"Oh, isn't it a shame that that knowledge was lost,\" you automatically know something about it. It was not universal. Universal inner truth does not get lost. Getting lost is not built into inner\ntruth. You have to understand that secret knowledge, knowledge that is not allowed to mutate, will die out in the world and is of no value. It is of no value as a universal principle. It is of no value for the totality. It\nis not a knowing that is going to bring an effective mutation.\n\nWhenever I meet people who have the Venus there, they are always interested in the obscure of the esoteric world: how to read somebody's nature in feeling the bumps on their head, or by looking at the\nshape of their toe nails and at the waves on your fingers. I had a student who had Venus in the 24, on the other side, and he talked to me about the most outrageous things. I can't imagine anybody being interested\nin that stuff. This is the Venusian aspect.\n\nWhere the pressure can be so strong that one can be eventually incapable of handling the exoteric realities. Where a reliance on secret knowledge leads to obscurity and can't bring a universal truth. These\nare people who really think that they know and they are holding on to it because they think that it brings them power.\n\nPlease understand something about the nature of knowing. Knowing is of no value unless it is openly put out into the world to either be devoured alive or to be a mutation. The moment that somebody has a\nknowing that they do not want to reveal, automatically, up until the point that it is revealed, it cannot be of universal value. It cannot mutate unless it goes out into the world. It has to go out acoustically; you\nhave to hear it."

      "raw": "We have seen that when we are looking at the third line and its process of trial and error that belongs to every third line, you also see in every third line that these relationships with the other side always come as\na surprise. The first to the third line is convinced that it is: \"I know\". They are only within the gate process. But the reality is that this line,\n\nInterdependence, says as a heading: It is exceedingly difficult for truth to stand alone. By the way, it does not mean that you can't carry your \"I know\" all the way to the bank. The reality is that it is exceeding\ndifficult because at some point or another, if somebody else does not get to know what you know, it does not mutate and therefore is useless. This is the whole thing about being individual and dealing with\nmutation.\n\nPage 3\n\nMutation is very cruel. If you don't know and if you can't explain it, you are really going to suffer; which means that, particularly at the mental level, if individuals don't complete the whole knowing circuit\nthemselves, they have to find other individuals in their process that they can deal with. It will be very difficult for them to deal with people who are mentally collective. For example, I have the 43/23 and the\n61, and JOrgen has the 24. That 24 has to come from somebody who is fundamentally individual, like\nJurgen. We are both only defined as individuals. It makes it possible to go through that process, but I can do it with an individual. It will be very difficult to bring my knowing directly to the collective. It has to go\nthrough the whole process.\n\nThe Moon exalted. The ability to establish relationships for the actualization of truths, and through their nurturing and protective power to ensure a stable environment in which they can continue to grow.\nRemember, this is the frequency of bonds made and broken. You know that it will be very difficult for the individual knower to really have relationships that can actualize the truth. It is not impossible, but\ndifficult.\n\nThe pressure to know enhanced through collaboration. The thing to recognize is that all third lines, due to their resonance to the sixth lines, are breaking the ground for the potential wisdom and peace that lie\nwithin the sixth lines by going through the mistakes, the trial and error. These third line Inner Truth people constantly are dealing with the wrong people. They constantly bang into people that can't help\nthem actualize their knowing. Eventually, if they are fortunate, they begin to recognize that there are certain people that can be beneficial for them and other people that cannot.\n\nMars in detriment. With an abundance of energy and in possession of a truth, the tendency to leave others behind or be crushed by their resistance. Impatience with others and the forsaking of relationships. This is\nclassic: a third line who breaks the bond. \"They can't make my knowing rational the way I want it made rational.\" Remember, you are always trying to be the other side. Everybody who has a question wants to\nbring their own answer. Everybody that has a confusion wants to make sense out of it themselves, and everybody that has the inner truth wants to make it rational themselves. It just does not work that way.\nThese people are impatient with others. What these people do is: If they do not get their knowing to mutate to the next stage, they abandon that relationship and go on to the next one. Other people can be\nquite upset by all that. After all, here is somebody that is inspiring for them and that person simply walks away from them. As far as they are concerned, they don't have what it takes. This is their process of trial\nand error."

      "heading": "Research",
      "raw": "When you get to the upper trigram, to the fourth line, you are dealing with the single- mindedness. When you look at the 43.4, which is part of this stream, you have the One-track mind and this gives you a very\nstrong idea about the nature of this fourth line. The fourth and fifth lines are transpersonal; they are able to recognize that there is the potential for rationalization.\n\nWhat they are looking for, in a sense, is to make music with somebody. They have all the sounds in their heads and the rationalization is just taking away the static so that the station comes in clear, so that you\ncan really get the acoustic picture, if you will. This line, this being fixed on the knowing, is called\nResearch.\n\nThe capacity of concentration to explore the depth of inner truth and maximize its application to fundamental principles. They are fixed on this \"I must know\". In the extreme, these people can really\nseem to be mad in their fixedness to know. They must know. That does not mean that they will only research things that are valid to research. They can get fixed on trying to know something that is deeply\nobscure. They get lost for the rest of their lives and they never really know.\n\nPage 4\n\nI know somebody with this line who is fascinated by numerology. They will spend the rest of their lives trying to figure out what that is all about. They are just lost in that. They have to know it. They are\nobsessed with knowing. They want to win the lottery.\n\nOn the other side, Jupiter in detriment. Where the tendency to expansion and integration leads to involving others in the research and may end in a diversity of confusing applications. Here you have the\ntwo sides of the individual process. The exalted side says, \"This is my knowing. This is my way. Don't influence me. You can go along with me, you can help me out, but don't influence. Don't get in my way.\nThis is my knowing. \" On the other side you have what is intrinsic in the individual. On one side they are resisting all influence and on the other side, they want to be influential because they want to be mutative.\nThe other side is not a negative, like all the detriments. It is simply about seeing the mechanic. These people will lose that control in that sense. They will be very fixed in that knowing. Due to the fact that\nthey desperately want to get to some kind of rationalization, they will involve others who take that inspiration and will go in many directions. That may be of value in terms of all the different directions\nthat the other people take, but it is very uncomfortable for the individual knower who started that process.\n\nThe detriment on this side is: The illusion that collaboration will enhance inspiration. My advice for all individuals: If you are going to be conditioned in your individual mental process, it is better to be\nconditioned by the planets than to be conditioned by a person. That is clear. It is much easier for the individual because they will always have the sense of \"that is truly myself\". It is not coming from the life\nexperience of somebody else that happens to have that particular gate and brings that energy through."

      "heading": "Influence",
      "raw": "We know that first lines are the essence of the hexagram and fifth lines are how the hexagram is seen by the outside or the totality. The one thing that you can see very clearly about the 61.5 is that the totality\nrecognizes the power inherent in Inner Truth. What is projected on the 61.5 is that they have influence.\nThink about the difference between the two projective resonances. We have the second line in which the projecting out of Inner Truth results in people saying, \"Aren't they clever? This is a smart one. This is a\nbrilliant one.\" When you get to the fifth line and the outside is projecting onto the Inner Truth, they are saying, \"This is the one that knows. This is the one that really has influence because they can bring about\nand inspire mutation.\"\n\nHere in this fifth line, Saturn exalted. The enlightened father-figure whose recognized wisdom and powerful assertion can mold a generation by its influence. This is very nice. The pressure to know that\nmay result in influence and wisdom. Think about the advantages of being a fifth line. Everybody is projecting on the 61.5 that they have the inner truth. If they do, their reputation just continues to grow.\nUltimately, they are seen as a guiding force and a force of wisdom, which may in fact be so or not. When it is projected on them that they are the ones who really know and what they deliver is unknowable, then\nall of that will simply crash.\n\nOn the other side of this, Mars in detriment. A tendency in power to want to enforce compliance to ensure lasting influence. The pressure in knowing to resent challenges and demand acceptance. In other words, \"I\nam the enlightened one. Don't challenge me. I know and you don't.\" This is their stance in that. They do not want anybody to challenge their knowing. Now, of course, they are going to be challenged. The\ncollective would never let them get away with it, and they'd better really know. Otherwise, that challenge can be something that is very uncomfortable for them."

      "raw": "Page 5\n\nIn our process of looking at the lines of transition, we talked about how the nature of the line is that it is looking at the entire circuit. It is looking for the potential fulfillment of the whole circuit before it is ready\nto make a commitment. This 61.6 is a mutation of that, if you will. It is not quite like any other sixth line.\nWhat the 61.6 is interested in is not only fulfilling the whole individual process, the right direction, the role model, the ability to explain it, the social spirit to be able to share it with others, the penetrating\nawareness that brings it into the existential now. It is all for the purpose of convincing and explaining to the collective how it all works. In other words, for the 61.6 this is not just a matter of trying to make a\ncommitment to the fulfillment of the individual process, but it is a commitment to go beyond the individual process to be actually able to mutate the collective. So there is an enormous lack of\ninvolvement in inner truth by 61.6's. They are rarely getting their inspiration out. Why bother, unless that inspiration will get all the way through that whole individual process and be able to mutate the collective\nfield?\n\nIt is called Appeal. Pluto exalted. The profound attunement to the collectivity that can lure the public to a truth. Inspiration that can bring clarity to the collective. Pluto will eventually get there some time in the\nnext 20-25 years. They can bring something new to the collective. A truly mutative gate. But the knowing that lies here as inspiration, remember that inspiration is not awareness, still has to be rationalized. It still\nhas to become an insight it still has to be explained. It still has to go through all of these processes.\n\nIf a 61.6 is just sitting there alone and it does not have any of all the other attributes, it is looking out at the individuals that it meets and the process that it goes through and says, \"I will not tell them what I\nknow. This will never be of any value. This will never be able to mutate that collective.\" It is so common.\nThe moment that a 61.6 is engaged in inspiring others, you know that they are going to have impact on the collective, positive or negative.\n\nOn the Martian side: A reliance on shop-worn cliches and slogans that may be new in their level of energy but inevitably fall on deaf ears. This is the whole problem for the individual. It always has to find\na way, a language or a methodology to reach out to the collective that is so different from the individual.\nSo often the individual meets the very thing that they are: deafness. All individuals are deaf. They do not listen to anybody. What they get is a whole collective that is deaf to them as a possibility in their process.\n\nOf course, what that means is that here, in the detriment of the 61.6, there is this sense that you will never be really able to get it across. Let's give them a couple of mantras and see how this works, but basically\nthis is like, \"I am not going to get involved with this because it is going to lead nowhere.\" This is the aspect of, The delusion that inspiration can bring clarity to the collective.\n\nIn the 61 st gate we always have potential delusion until there is a way to explain the nature of that knowing. Both of them are attuned, please understand that. The exalted has the inspiration to bring\nsomething new. The detriment can recognize what the collectivity needs. They just don't have the real mutative force to bring it across. They simply know the language for them but not the real knowing\ninside. So these sixth lines stand back. In standing back and being there in the world, they are part of our world aura. There is always the potential that true mutation can take place and can have a vast impact on\nthe collective. All mental mutation has to have this as its backbone.\n\nUnless individual knowing can be accepted by collective understanding and sensing, mutation has not taken place. The potential to touch the collectivity with awareness at the mental level is rooted here in this\nsixth line. It is there. The collective exists and the individual at the mental level knows it, and its ordeal is, \"Can I mutate them? Can I get that across to them?\" That is their process.\n\nWith my 3's, I have been busily mutating all of you for years at the mental level because that is part of what the process is: to bring an individual inspiration to the collective mind. Once that individual\n\nPage 6\n\ninspiration is explainable, if then the collective, the logic and the abstract, can grasp it. The mutation has taken hold.\n\nNo sixth line standing back there from the distance sees that that is an easy thing to do. They may become very picky, like all sixth lines, so picky that if you go to the 24.6 on the other side, you end up looking\nThe Gift-horse in the mouth. You become so picky that you do not get to see it when it is there.\n\nThe 61.6 leads over to the 60.1. In both of these gates lies the potential to mutate. One is the pressure to mutate mentally and the other is the pressure to mutate genetically. The 61.6 waits for the 24 and the 60\nwaits for the 3. It goes through the limitation of carrying with it all the possibility to allow mutation to take place. When the 3 comes, the mutation can take place in order to bring the mutation into the body,\ninto the genetics, into the cells, into the DNA. The moment that the 3 is there, you have the structure of the cell itself. It is not enough that knowing is something that is only mentally mutative. It has to be\nbiologically mutative. I have the 61 toJiirgen's 24 and I have the 60 to his 3. Thus we can bring the potential for mutation.\n\nPage 7"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 61 INNER TRUTH\n\nThe collective mind, the abstract and the logic, are so deeply related to each other, they need to be fulfilled through each other. Yin and yang, if you will: the basic dualities coming together into some kind\nof Tao. The collective process is rooted in what already is, in what has been taken in during the life movement. In other words, as we are alive and moving in space, we interact with the environment as we\nmove. The abstract person interacts with that environment in its relative present and reflects on it as a past phenomenon. The logical person goes through this movement and takes in the information and projects it\ninto the future's path. They are in the same kind of business. They are in the business of relating to what they have gone through. But when you come to the individuality of the 61, when you come to Inner\nTruth, none of that exists. This is not a visual mental process. It is acoustic, like everything having to do with the individual process. The 61 as an inspiration is not the visions passing through the mind but the\nstatic noise inside of the mind that keeps the mind occupied.\n\nWhenever you deal with individual knowing at the mental level, it is very important to understand the law of the knower which is to know what is knowable and of value, to know what is knowable and\nunnecessary (you don't necessarily have to know how a jet engine operates to get by in this life) and to know what is unknowable. The knower has to leave alone what is unknowable. If you don't know what is\nunknowable and you can't leave it alone, you go mad.\n\nThe 61st gate, Inner Truth, is a wonderful image. You have this yang sandwich with a yin interior, so that the inner truth is really penetrating to all this yang propaganda to get to the yin essence. This is the gate of\nmystery. This is the gate of 'my-story'. This is individual knowing which is a spontaneous mutation.\nBecause of that, it has no foundation in either the past or the future. It is not a sequence. It is not a pattern.\nIt is this spontaneous, mysterious my-story, this mysterious knowing.\n\nThe fuel is the pressure of the unknown or the unknowable. This is what is driving the 61. It must know for itself. It must know in the some way that the 28 has to know that life is of value, or that the 55 has to\nknow deeply that a spirit exists in this life. The 61 is the inspiration for the whole mental plane of knowing. The 61 wants one thing only: silence in the mind. No voices talking, no dialogue, nothing.\nMaybe music.\n\nThe energy mechanic is the struggle for silence. Please recognize, that 'silence' in this sense means that you know what you need to know. Whenever I deal with the 61,1 always go to the oracle of Delphi which\nsays, 'Know thyself. \"Know thyself is the only thing of value to know. Everything else is secondary. If you know yourself, the unknowable is you and you do not have to seek the unknowable at all because the\nmoment that you truly know yourself, you know the mystery of life because you get to live it, because you are designed for your mystery, for your story.\n\nWhat the 61 wants to know is: What is my story? Who am I? How does it all work? What does it all mean? To get to the inner truth.\n\nAbove the lines in the black book it says: The awareness of universal underlying principles. To know what the universal principles are and not to make them up, not to think that they happened in the past and\nbelieve that they were there, that they knew something that we did not, or that it is in the future somehow.\nYou see, the most incredible thing about being human is that the collective is always at the mercy of mutation, like the tribe. Mutation is what makes all of this interesting. Mutation is what breaks us out of\nthe old abstract cycles. Mutation shatters the pattern and mutation brings us into a new realization, a new recognition, a new wonder. It is there all the time.\n\n61.1 Occult Knowledge\n\nPage 1\n\nAll first lines give you the essence of a hexagram. It gives you its basic nature. It is its foundation. These lines are introspective. Inner truth lies in going inwards, going deeply into this acoustic field.\n\nThis first line is called Occult knowledge. The foundation of all inner truth is in occult knowledge.

But the reality is that this line,\n\nInterdependence, says as a heading: It is exceedingly difficult for truth to stand alone. By the way, it does not mean that you can't carry your \"I know\" all the way to the bank. The reality is that it is exceeding\ndifficult because at some point or another, if somebody else does not get to know what you know, it does not mutate and therefore is useless. This is the whole thing about being individual and dealing with\nmutation.\n\nPage 3\n\nMutation is very cruel. If you don't know and if you can't explain it, you are really going to suffer; which means that, particularly at the mental level, if individuals don't complete the whole knowing circuit\nthemselves, they have to find other individuals in their process that they can deal with. It will be very difficult for them to deal with people who are mentally collective. For example, I have the 43/23 and the\n61, and JOrgen has the 24. That 24 has to come from somebody who is fundamentally individual, like\nJurgen. We are both only defined as individuals. It makes it possible to go through that process, but I can do it with an individual. It will be very difficult to bring my knowing directly to the collective. It has to go\nthrough the whole process.\n\nThe Moon exalted. The ability to establish relationships for the actualization of truths, and through their nurturing and protective power to ensure a stable environment in which they can continue to grow.\nRemember, this is the frequency of bonds made and broken. You know that it will be very difficult for the individual knower to really have relationships that can actualize the truth. It is not impossible, but\ndifficult.\n\nThe pressure to know enhanced through collaboration. The thing to recognize is that all third lines, due to their resonance to the sixth lines, are breaking the ground for the potential wisdom and peace that lie\nwithin the sixth lines by going through the mistakes, the trial and error. These third line Inner Truth people constantly are dealing with the wrong people. They constantly bang into people that can't help\nthem actualize their knowing. Eventually, if they are fortunate, they begin to recognize that there are certain people that can be beneficial for them and other people that cannot.\n\nMars in detriment. With an abundance of energy and in possession of a truth, the tendency to leave others behind or be crushed by their resistance. Impatience with others and the forsaking of relationships. This is\nclassic: a third line who breaks the bond. \"They can't make my knowing rational the way I want it made rational.\" Remember, you are always trying to be the other side. Everybody who has a question wants to\nbring their own answer. Everybody that has a confusion wants to make sense out of it themselves, and everybody that has the inner truth wants to make it rational themselves. It just does not work that way.\nThese people are impatient with others. What these people do is: If they do not get their knowing to mutate to the next stage, they abandon that relationship and go on to the next one. Other people can be\nquite upset by all that. After all, here is somebody that is inspiring for them and that person simply walks away from them. As far as they are concerned, they don't have what it takes. This is their process of trial\nand error.\n\n61.4 Research\n\nWhen you get to the upper trigram, to the fourth line, you are dealing with the single- mindedness. When you look at the 43.4, which is part of this stream, you have the One-track mind and this gives you a very\nstrong idea about the nature of this fourth line. The fourth and fifth lines are transpersonal; they are able to recognize that there is the potential for rationalization.\n\nWhat they are looking for, in a sense, is to make music with somebody. They have all the sounds in their heads and the rationalization is just taking away the static so that the station comes in clear, so that you\ncan really get the acoustic picture, if you will. This line, this being fixed on the knowing, is called\nResearch.\n\nThe capacity of concentration to explore the depth of inner truth and maximize its application to fundamental principles. They are fixed on this \"I must know\". In the extreme, these people can really\nseem to be mad in their fixedness to know. They must know. That does not mean that they will only research things that are valid to research. They can get fixed on trying to know something that is deeply\nobscure. They get lost for the rest of their lives and they never really know.\n\nPage 4\n\nI know somebody with this line who is fascinated by numerology. They will spend the rest of their lives trying to figure out what that is all about. They are just lost in that. They have to know it. They are\nobsessed with knowing. They want to win the lottery.\n\nOn the other side, Jupiter in detriment. Where the tendency to expansion and integration leads to involving others in the research and may end in a diversity of confusing applications. Here you have the\ntwo sides of the individual process. The exalted side says, \"This is my knowing. This is my way. Don't influence me. You can go along with me, you can help me out, but don't influence. Don't get in my way.\nThis is my knowing. \" On the other side you have what is intrinsic in the individual. On one side they are resisting all influence and on the other side, they want to be influential because they want to be mutative.\nThe other side is not a negative, like all the detriments. It is simply about seeing the mechanic. These people will lose that control in that sense. They will be very fixed in that knowing. Due to the fact that\nthey desperately want to get to some kind of rationalization, they will involve others who take that inspiration and will go in many directions. That may be of value in terms of all the different directions\nthat the other people take, but it is very uncomfortable for the individual knower who started that process.\n\nThe detriment on this side is: The illusion that collaboration will enhance inspiration. My advice for all individuals: If you are going to be conditioned in your individual mental process, it is better to be\nconditioned by the planets than to be conditioned by a person. That is clear. It is much easier for the individual because they will always have the sense of \"that is truly myself\". It is not coming from the life\nexperience of somebody else that happens to have that particular gate and brings that energy through.\n\n61.5 Influence\n\nWe know that first lines are the essence of the hexagram and fifth lines are how the hexagram is seen by the outside or the totality. The one thing that you can see very clearly about the 61.5 is that the totality\nrecognizes the power inherent in Inner Truth. What is projected on the 61.5 is that they have influence.\nThink about the difference between the two projective resonances. We have the second line in which the projecting out of Inner Truth results in people saying, \"Aren't they clever? This is a smart one. This is a\nbrilliant one.\" When you get to the fifth line and the outside is projecting onto the Inner Truth, they are saying, \"This is the one that knows. This is the one that really has influence because they can bring about\nand inspire mutation.\"\n\nHere in this fifth line, Saturn exalted. The enlightened father-figure whose recognized wisdom and powerful assertion can mold a generation by its influence. This is very nice. The pressure to know that\nmay result in influence and wisdom. Think about the advantages of being a fifth line. Everybody is projecting on the 61.5 that they have the inner truth. If they do, their reputation just continues to grow.\nUltimately, they are seen as a guiding force and a force of wisdom, which may in fact be so or not. When it is projected on them that they are the ones who really know and what they deliver is unknowable, then\nall of that will simply crash.\n\nOn the other side of this, Mars in detriment. A tendency in power to want to enforce compliance to ensure lasting influence. The pressure in knowing to resent challenges and demand acceptance. In other words, \"I\nam the enlightened one. Don't challenge me. I know and you don't.\" This is their stance in that. They do not want anybody to challenge their knowing. Now, of course, they are going to be challenged. The\ncollective would never let them get away with it, and they'd better really know. Otherwise, that challenge can be something that is very uncomfortable for them.\n\n61.6 Appeal\n\nPage 5\n\nIn our process of looking at the lines of transition, we talked about how the nature of the line is that it is looking at the entire circuit. It is looking for the potential fulfillment of the whole circuit before it is ready\nto make a commitment. This 61.6 is a mutation of that, if you will. It is not quite like any other sixth line.\nWhat the 61.6 is interested in is not only fulfilling the whole individual process, the right direction, the role model, the ability to explain it, the social spirit to be able to share it with others, the penetrating\nawareness that brings it into the existential now. It is all for the purpose of convincing and explaining to the collective how it all works. In other words, for the 61.6 this is not just a matter of trying to make a\ncommitment to the fulfillment of the individual process, but it is a commitment to go beyond the individual process to be actually able to mutate the collective. So there is an enormous lack of\ninvolvement in inner truth by 61.6's. They are rarely getting their inspiration out. Why bother, unless that inspiration will get all the way through that whole individual process and be able to mutate the collective\nfield?\n\nIt is called Appeal. Pluto exalted. The profound attunement to the collectivity that can lure the public to a truth. Inspiration that can bring clarity to the collective. Pluto will eventually get there some time in the\nnext 20-25 years. They can bring something new to the collective. A truly mutative gate. But the knowing that lies here as inspiration, remember that inspiration is not awareness, still has to be rationalized. It still\nhas to become an insight it still has to be explained. It still has to go through all of these processes.\n\nIf a 61.6 is just sitting there alone and it does not have any of all the other attributes, it is looking out at the individuals that it meets and the process that it goes through and says, \"I will not tell them what I\nknow. This will never be of any value. This will never be able to mutate that collective.\" It is so common.\nThe moment that a 61.6 is engaged in inspiring others, you know that they are going to have impact on the collective, positive or negative.\n\nOn the Martian side: A reliance on shop-worn cliches and slogans that may be new in their level of energy but inevitably fall on deaf ears. This is the whole problem for the individual. It always has to find\na way, a language or a methodology to reach out to the collective that is so different from the individual.\nSo often the individual meets the very thing that they are: deafness. All individuals are deaf. They do not listen to anybody. What they get is a whole collective that is deaf to them as a possibility in their process.\n\nOf course, what that means is that here, in the detriment of the 61.6, there is this sense that you will never be really able to get it across. Let's give them a couple of mantras and see how this works, but basically\nthis is like, \"I am not going to get involved with this because it is going to lead nowhere.\" This is the aspect of, The delusion that inspiration can bring clarity to the collective.\n\nIn the 61 st gate we always have potential delusion until there is a way to explain the nature of that knowing. Both of them are attuned, please understand that. The exalted has the inspiration to bring\nsomething new. The detriment can recognize what the collectivity needs. They just don't have the real mutative force to bring it across. They simply know the language for them but not the real knowing\ninside. So these sixth lines stand back. In standing back and being there in the world, they are part of our world aura. There is always the potential that true mutation can take place and can have a vast impact on\nthe collective. All mental mutation has to have this as its backbone.\n\nUnless individual knowing can be accepted by collective understanding and sensing, mutation has not taken place. The potential to touch the collectivity with awareness at the mental level is rooted here in this\nsixth line. It is there. The collective exists and the individual at the mental level knows it, and its ordeal is, \"Can I mutate them? Can I get that across to them?\" That is their process.\n\nWith my 3's, I have been busily mutating all of you for years at the mental level because that is part of what the process is: to bring an individual inspiration to the collective mind. Once that individual\n\nPage 6\n\ninspiration is explainable, if then the collective, the logic and the abstract, can grasp it. The mutation has taken hold.\n\nNo sixth line standing back there from the distance sees that that is an easy thing to do. They may become very picky, like all sixth lines, so picky that if you go to the 24.6 on the other side, you end up looking\nThe Gift-horse in the mouth. You become so picky that you do not get to see it when it is there.\n\nThe 61.6 leads over to the 60.1. In both of these gates lies the potential to mutate. One is the pressure to mutate mentally and the other is the pressure to mutate genetically. The 61.6 waits for the 24 and the 60\nwaits for the 3. It goes through the limitation of carrying with it all the possibility to allow mutation to take place. When the 3 comes, the mutation can take place in order to bring the mutation into the body,\ninto the genetics, into the cells, into the DNA. The moment that the 3 is there, you have the structure of the cell itself. It is not enough that knowing is something that is only mentally mutative. It has to be\nbiologically mutative. I have the 61 toJiirgen's 24 and I have the 60 to his 3. Thus we can bring the potential for mutation.\n\nPage 7",

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 32 DURATION\n\nThe 32nd hexagram is part of the channel of Transformation, a design of being driven. It is fueled by the energy of the 54th gate, the Marrying Maiden, the gate of ambition. The 32nd gate, like all gates in the\nsplenic awareness, like all gates of awareness, is a gate of fear, and the fear of the 32nd gate is the fear of failure. Because it is the nature of the fear that is associated with this gate, every single line of the 32nd\ngate is dealing at some level or another with the fear of failure.\n\nThe 32nd gate is Duration, and it is the gate of continuity. It is a deeply conservative gate. It is the mirror of the emotional revolutionary in the 49 on the other side. It is conservative for the benefit of the tribe. It\nis trying to conserve the material success because it does not want to be a failure. Everything about the instinctive stream has to do with achieving material success for the tribe. The 32nd gate is deeply\nconcerned about whether or not it will be a success and is very much afraid of failure.\n\nIt is an instinctive stream which is deeply related to the nose. People with the 32nd gate can smell failure coming because they have an attribute which is the remembrance of failure, unlike the 54th gate that can\nonly remember victory. That is why it is inherently conservative. It can recognize that transformation can always take place.\n\nThe awareness here is to recognize what can be transformed, what should be transformed, or not. The ambition of the 54 does not always have to be satisfied. There is a time to move up the ladder. There is a\ntime to change your product line. There is a time to go through these processes. The awareness in the 32 is trying to judge clearly what can and what cannot be transformed.\n\nThe awareness potential: this is a liquid regulator. Our memory is in our water. The water in the cells carries our memory. This is all about a memory stream. Any activation in this stream is always going to\nbe an indication of deep cellular memory in a human being. There is a memory for what did not work. By the way, the smell of failure builds up over a lifetime of seeing what does not work and getting a smell of\nwhat does not work so that you can pick up a whiff of that when it is coming.\n\nWhen you look in the Rave I'Ching at the heading above the line for the 32nd hexagram, it says: The only thing which endures is change. Don't misunderstand the nature of the 32nd gate. It is conservative, but\nradical conservatism leads to annihilation, leads to the end, leads to failure. For example, you have all these people who are still trying to produce teletype machines after the telefax came. It is time to\nrecognize that you can only get to some point and then you have to change it. If you don't change, you are going to be left by the wayside.\n\nBuilt into the nature of the 32nd gate is always a recognition that what truly endures is change, which is the evolutionary process. This is about being conservative in terms of what you will change to. This is the\nnature of the conservativeness here. It is not about rejecting change. This is very important to understand because it helps us to recognize that the tribe can be changed because, at its most conservative gate,\nchange is its nature. It is how one approaches that change.\n\n32.1 Conservation\n\nIn the first line, we start with introspection. We are starting with the foundation of the house. The first line will look inwards. It is the most conservative of all of these lines.\n\nIt is called Conservation. A life sustaining respect and attention to all aspects of a process. This is the ideal of the introspective field. In other words, yes, change is inevitable but I will make sure that I have\nall the details before I get involved with that change and leave behind tradition.\n\nPage 1\n\nMars in detriment. An uncontrollable urge to bypass essentials which inevitably leads to the disruption of continuity. Because it is the tribe and because it is inherently conservative, if you jump over the details,\nyou will not be able to make the transition from what was old to what can be new. There will be something missing and you will end up with all kinds of problems associated with this.\n\nThe first line: because it is essential to the tribe, the detail is essential. What you have with the detriment are tribes that make jumps. For example, you can see that we find some Neolithic tribes in the middle of\nthe Amazonian jungle, and what do we bring them? We bring them frying pans and mirrors. We bring them this whole leap, this whole transformation in their culture, and all the detail is missing in between.\nSo many aboriginal people have suffered because there has been this enormous gap between their culture and the one that is coming and imposing their way upon them without the detail being there. Those within\nthe aboriginal culture who made that jump, because they do not have the details, that inevitably leads to problems. They do not have continuity. They lose their culture. They jump into the other culture. They\ndon't have the ability to bring the culture along and allow it to mature with new technology and new input.\n\nThe first line is about introspection. When the introspection is missing, failure can happen. The failure will be there in the continuity. The fear is that, once you see that the change is inevitable (this is the\nchannel of being driven), there is this enormous urge to just change. Damn the details. \"I want that mirror;\nI don't care about the Madonna.\"\n\nOne has to be careful with this. It is intended to be very conservative. It is the foundation of the tribe's success. The material success in the tribe is, \"Okay, but let's keep our continuity.\" All the aboriginal\npeople that were integrated into other cultures now make their living by selling their aboriginal art. They kept their culture and it becomes a material success for them because their continuity is of value. They've\nbrought the past into the future and they can offer it and still provide for the nature of the tribe.\n\nWhen you are looking at the ego circuit, you are looking at the two streams that go to the ego. The emotional stream that goes to the ego, the stream of sensitivity, is all about communal life. The communal\nlife is looking for the initiation (25/51). Here, you have a natural flow that takes place and this is not about communal life but life in the corporate culture. It is about the work structure. Who is working with\nwhom and how we work together is organized in this stream. It begins in the 45th gate which is the owner of the company. The 21st gate is the president, the 26th gate is the salesman or the head of sales, the 44th\ngate is the personnel manager and the 32nd gate is the financial officer.\n\nThe 32nd gate decides whether money is spent or not and on what money is spent. They have a great deal of power because of that and because below the financial manager are all these people in the 54 who try\nto climb up the corporate ladder, the Marrying Maidens who want to go all the way up to the top and be the CEO. The 54's are always trying to be familiar with the 32's. The 32s are always in a situation where\nthe Marrying Maidens, with their ambition, are trying to get the financial officer to invest in things so that the transformation and the change can take place.\n\n32.2 Restraint\n\nIlm the Rave I'Ching it says: The control of power for the.benefitand enhancement of Jrarmony. \"I will not proviide imomey for this person to be hired.\" 5d's,are always trying to be familiar. That is their job..\nLike the 19's on the Other side, they are always flirting. Tlhe 5d\"s flirt to be familiar: you go up to the boss while he is having his dinner and say, \"Good evening, Mr. So and so,\" and they book at you and say,\n\"Do I know you?\" \"Yes, I work in the department.\"\n\nPage 2\n\nThe other side of this jupiter in detriment. A tendency in frustration, ;particularly from a position of strength, to social withdrawal rather than persistent control. The projection here is that II have to control\neverything, 'phase people are control freaks. Tlhis leads directly to the 21.\n\nThis is very tribal business. \"I have -to control the resources to make sure that there is no failure. I am either going to control it harmoniously or in a way that people are very uncomfortable -with ime. I say,\nyou are Hired.\" That is what the :32 can always say. I can look -at the Marrying Maiden and say, *Yes, very nice.\" The same one that comes up to the 'boss and says, \"Good morning, Mr. So-and-so,\" if the boss\nlooks at you and says, \"Who are you?\" then you Will not make your way up the ladder.\n\nRestraint is what the note is here. The potential for transformation that may be beneficial to others. But the second line is in control of this, projecting it out. We know that second lines can lead to problems due\nto their projection. The 32.2 can get into trouble projecting into the Marrying Maiden and saying, \"Yes, this is a wonderful idea. This is what we will do. This is what will be the change.\" They are just\nprojecting it out. They project their power, \"I have got the pocket book. I am projecting my power.\" This creates problems and disharmony.\n\nThe frustration with controls or being controlled. The frustration of having to control people all the time.\nOnce you project power outwards, then you are stuck having to live with it.\n\nFor analysts, all second lines are difficult to read because, basically, we do not want to tell people things that we think, moralistically, are uncomfortable. You don't want to tell somebody about their 58.2, that\nthey have the line of Perversion. Everybody gets very nervous. When you are looking at the second line, the thing to recognize is that it is a part of your nature that will get into trouble, and you are supposed to.\nAfter all, it is a learning process.\n\nA second line is not by its very nature a problem and, at the same time, design is a duality. The restraint can be there. Those who project learn to recognize projection. This is part of the process. There is a\nmaturity that can take place in this process. But there is a great deal of frustration that is rooted in this.\n\nProjecting out power means that you have to back it up and, if you can't back it up, you get into trouble.\nThat is where the fear of failure comes in. Can I project my control and maintain it without creating disharmony or problems? That would be a failure. No tribal organization, no corporation, can function\nunless there is some level of harmony within the corporate culture. Otherwise, it does not work.\n\nThis is one of the things we had when we were living in a second line phase that existed around the birth of Hitler (1888 until 1961) when we were in the previous global cycle. We have been in the first line\nsince 1961. Since 1888, we have witnessed the wars that took place: the Russian Japanese War, the First and Second World Wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, all during a time of projection. The\nprojecting of power. All second lines are trying to project out power and they can't necessarily back it up.\nWe've lived through an era of projection of power and we saw how devastating that could be to the planet. We also saw that, out of that, we have our modern age. There is no good or bad in the movie.\nThere is just the movie.\n\n32.3 Lack of continuity\n\nThis is simply stepping out there for the first time, trying to go across that channel and trying to make contact with the 54 on the other side, and the recognition that the 54 is really there. What the 54 is will\ncondition the nature of what the 32 is, this recognition of adaptation that has to take place within the channel. It is called Lack of continuity. This is exactly opposite to the nature of this hexagram which is\nabout continuity. One can be very irresponsible in terms of the nature of how one is conservative.\n\nPage 3\n\nMercury exalted. Indecision and persistent reevaluation, that only because of its basic intelligence manages to endure. The thing to recognize here is that this position of the 32nd gate is inherently\nintelligent. If you look at signs of intelligence in somebody's chart there are many, by the way-the 32nd hexagram is one of them. It is a sign of intelligence.\n\nThe Jupiterian side is: An over-reliance on traditionally legitimized standards that in times of change can be totally out of step and suffer unexpected humiliation. This is the whole thing about third lines anyway.\nYou make a bond and then the bond gets broken and there is going to be all kinds of stuff that gets left as the debris of that. This is all about the fear of failure.\n\nIndecision in times of transformation. \"What do I do and who do I do it with? Do I do it with you? If I do it with you, I cannot do it my way. I have to do it our way.\"\n\nThe other side of this: A lack of instinct in times of transformation. Not being able to get it at the right time. Not being able to adapt at the right time. The three is the kind of person that says to you, \"Yes,\nmaybe that will work. I'll think about it..\" Then they meet you again and they tell you,. \"Yes, I really think that I will do it. Let's set up a contract.\" They do not really know. It is indecisionL Everything gets\nprollonged. They are not really certain what to do with all of that. The whole thing them can fall apart. All of a sudden, you call them up for the day of the signing and they are not there anymore )because they\nhave broken that bond entirely, and it's gone.\n\n32.4 Right is might\n\nWhenever you come to the fourth line, remember the resonance between first and fourth linen You are coming to the upper trigram and you come to aichange in the nature of the frequency. The fourth line is\nabout externalization, the ometrack., You take one. aspect and run along with it: We also know that fourth lines are ihheremily corrupt or being corrupted.\n\nHere we have Right is; might.. Think about that because that is the one-crack. Everything is about the power. If you have the power, you are right. Even in times of change, certain underlying principles\nendure. Whoever controls, the! purse, controls, the purse. Where Jupiter will establish right action in, the larger social realm, Saturn will lead to inner strength and endurance as long as: it is not threatened from\nthe ouiside.\n\nThe instinct to maintain one's principles in times of change; or The instinct to maintain one's principles as long as one's security is not threatened. Either you have the power to maintain it, no matter what (Right is\nmight) and you corrupt others with that (\"I have the power and you do what I say whether you think that that is right or not.\"), or the other side is: \"I can only have the power if you do what I tell you to do. I will\nmake sure that I will not have people that are working for me who do not listen to my orders, whether they like them or not.\" This is just a one-track. It is neither good nor bad. It can be very successful when\nthe principles are correct. If the values are not correct, they still have that one -track-mind.\n\n32.5 Flexibility\n\nThe fifth line is the fulfillment of the essence of what the hexagram is. It is the capacity to universalize, to be able to bring it out, not only to the gate that is at the other end of the channel, but to begin the process\nof moving into the circuitry. This is something that has a broader movement. Due to its collective keynote, it is an aspect that can bring the tribe to collective change.\n\nPage 4\n\nThis is something that we deal with in the tension of the world today. For example, the United Nations, as a collective organization, wants the Bosnians, the Serbs and the Croats, who are tribal, to make peace\nwith each other. If you want to look at the fulfillment of this hexagram, it is about the flexible projection of power. Fifth lines resonate to second lines. It is no longer the pure projection of the second line. This is\nthe next step up in this structure. This projection here is all about recognizing that one has to be flexible in the way one projects outwards.\n\nFlexibility. Easy adaptation to circumstances. Moon exalted. Superficiality is a valuable tool that while masking the inner light permits adaptation to prevailing conditions. This is all about keeping it\nunderneath. You know that you have the power to project but circumstances are not allowing you to project your power at this moment. So you bide your time. You wait and see. You wait for your\nopportunity and then you project it out.\n\nMars on the other side: The urge to express oneself in direct and often violent rejection of conformity.\nConformity is the nature of the tribe which is deeply conservative. The violence in this is mirrored on the other side in the 49.5. It is mirrored in the possibility of being able to fulfill revolution so that revolution\nbecomes a universalized process. In that, there is always the possibility here for vast change in the nature of the tribe. Suddenly, the tribe can be brought to a point of becoming one with the collective, in that\nsense.\n\nAn instinct for adaptation in times of change. To know when to project your power and when not to.\nRemember, underneath that is the fear of failure. \"I'd better not project my power out because, if I do so, I destabilize everything so I'd better hold that all back inside of me and wait and see what happens.\"\n\nThe potential of the instinct to reject adaptation and conformity in times of change. The keynote: in times of change. That is the only time this is going to come into play. These are the kind of people that you\nwant holding the purse strings when there is a vast change in the society around you. They are the ones who should be in power in those moments. What happens is that they are the ones that naturally have the\ngreatest impact in times of change.\n\nOne of the classic examples that you know about is in corporations and what they call downsizing. This is the detriment. This is very common. We are not going to look after all the people in the company\nanymore who have been loyal to us for 25 years, who have been our family and allowed us to become wealthy. We will fire all of them because our shareholders need profits. We are in times of change\nbecause we have a globalizing economy, and I am sorry you have to be the victim. We really wanted to do this five years ago, but now we can do it. \"\n\nIt depends on where you are in that. If you are victim, this is a terrible thing. It appears to be deeply violent in that sense. If you are not the victim, it can just mean being flexible. The person who is making\nthat decision says, \"look, if I do not fire these five thousand workers, the Indonesians will steal my market and all my other 25,000 workers will lose their jobs and my shareholders will go mad.\" That is the other\nside of the story. These things are not one -dimensional. That is the universalizing element.\n\nWhenever you see fifth lines in a chart, whenever you see transits that are affecting fifth lines, you know that there is a special kind of element at work that is trying to get things projected outward in a much\nlarger field. This is a universalizing process.\n\n32.6 Tranquility\n\nHere, we get to the roof of the house and we are not in the house anymore. The nature of the hexagram is going through a transformation. This is one of those lines that I kept running into so often because it can\n\nPage 5\n\nbe depressive and because we had Neptune activating the other side of it. Therefore, we have a whole generation of people in the early 1990's that went into all kinds of severe depressions due to the nature of\nthis line.\n\nConsider that the tribe is essentially materialist even when it is being communal at the other side.\nCommunalism is all about coming up with a bargain so that everybody has what they need. Tribal life is, by its very nature, material. This aspect of the tribe, moving up to the instinctive stream, is what is\nessential. It is the ability to recognize what will work, what change to accommodate, in order that the continuity of the material success of the tribe can survive, so that we need not be afraid of failure.\n\nThe fear of failure is a theme that we all live with. It is a global theme: this deep sense that we cannot fail, that we must have the material that we need. When you get to the sixth line, it is kind of like, \"Well, I am\nnot really interested in just that. There must be something else other than just climbing up the corporate ladder, making our bread and butter, doing our job.\"\n\nThe sixth line is called Tranquility. Change is inevitable. The projection of power in the 32nd hexagram is trying to make sure that transformation can take place, that there won't be a failure. It is trying to be\nconservative, trying to continue things. This line says, \"Yes, okay, but everything changes. Nothing stays the same. Everything just keeps on changing. Am I supposed to control that?\"\n\nThe sixth line is not about control anymore. It is a need now. The need to calmly face impermanence.\nPluto exalted. An underlying acceptance of change that may or may not lead to tranquility. It may, or it may not. On the other side, Neptune in detriment. Impermanence as proof of meaninglessness with its\nattendant manifestations, depression, delusion, and in the extreme, self-destruction. \"The tribe is meaningless, this business is meaningless. Why should I spend 20 years of my life investing in this\nbusiness when it will fall apart anyway due to changes in the society? Why did I spend all this money making hula-hoops? It will change. Why did I get involved with 8-track tapes? It will change.\" There is\nthis sense of: \"Why bother? Nothing is stable, nothing will last. I will kill myself.\"\n\nIn the white book: The instinctive awareness to accept change and transformation; or The fear engendered when change is experienced as impermanence and the potential for depression.\n\nWhenever you come to the nature of the sixth line, please recognize that it is always looking for the next hexagram. The next hexagram is the 50, the values, and the first line is The Immigrant. The whole thing\nfor the sixth line to recognize is that transition is always there and they will always be The Immigrant.\nThis is their whole thing. These are not the people to establish a business that is going to last forever.\nThey have to be very clear that all of this is coming anyway. They are here to ride the wave so that they can be the immigrants that can establish the new values out of what the change brings. These people can\nbe visionaries. They can look ahead and say: \"I will not do this because I can see what is coming. What is coming is either going to frighten them or it gives them a sense of tranquility. \"Yes, I can see the change\nis coming. I do not want to get involved with this. I can wait to discover what my values will be in what is coming.\"\n\nPage 6",

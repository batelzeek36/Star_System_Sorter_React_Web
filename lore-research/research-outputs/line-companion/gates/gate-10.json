  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 10 TREADING\n\nWe come to this place in which the Vessel gets poured out, the 10th gate. It is by far the most complex of all the Vessel gates. It is a gate that provides the identity to the integration process. By the nature of their\nmechanics, the integration gates are more complex. The 10th gate is preceded in the wheel by the 25.6.\nWhatever\n\nWhen we come to the 10th gate, we come to the gate of our nature. In that sense, we come to a gate of being in the world. The most powerful conditioning gate is the 10th gate. It conditions the behavior of the\nworld through a very complex system, but the whole business of the 10th gate is the question that is raised in the 25.6 which is how does one live life as an expression? How does one express innocence in\nlife? How does one express one's rhythm in life? How does one express the existential quality necessary for being in the experience of life? All that is focused on the 10th gate because it is out of this gate that\nthe Vessel of Love is poured into each and every one of us, as an individual process.\n\nWe are all conditioned by this individual process of the 10th. gate. The 10th gate represents the possibility to love oneself. In that possibility, the ground or the framework of loving oneself is to love being in the\nworld because the 10th gate is about living in the world. It is about being part of the life process.\n\nAbove the 10th gate in the black book, it says, The underlying code of behavior... Code here is a genetic catch phrase, if you will. We have a code of behavior that is imprinted in us at a very early moment,\ninside of us, in the structure of the form that we are going to be endowed with, something that we could see when we were looking at the first 88 degrees of the sun. ...which ensures successful interaction\ndespite circumstances. Everything about behavior is what makes life easier. The moment that you are not being yourself, life is automatically going to be more difficult for you. The more you are being yourself\nthe stronger your capacity for survival in this life, regardless of the circumstances. To be yourself is the great success and when the 10 is connected to the 20, to be yourself is the opportunity to be awake: to be\nawake in the now in the world.\n\nThis whole business about a code of behavior is something very important when you do analysis. You have come to understand how the structure of a hexagram and the thematic or the keynotes associated\nwith each of the lines work, so you know that first lines are introspective and so on. What is important is to recognize that every single line in its structure also has a code of behavior. In other words, each line\nhas its code of behavior which can be seen in the 10th gate. If you want to understand the nature of fourth lines, look at the behavior of the 10.4, The Opportunist. Then you can see the opportunism built into all\nfourth lines. That is the correct behavior: to wait for that opportunity, to wait for that moment in which you are able to effectively externalize your influence. If you are a second line and everybody can look\ninside of you, it means to be a hermit, to be careful about those who can penetrate into you and take you away from your nature. In other words, in order to look at and to understand the nature of any given line,\nyou can also see that, not only do you have a keynote for its structure, but more than that, you have a built-in reference in which you can see the code of behavior that bests suits that particular line. That code\nof behavior for the lines is very important to keep in mind when you are doing somebody's chart.\n\nThink of the nature of genetic continuity. In genetic continuity, we know that lines in similar positions in the structure have a deep relationship to each other. From the basic teachings of Human Design, we know\nthat, as a global entity, we live inside of an emotional environment which is generated by all the solar plex combinations. We know that out of the solar plex will come the ultimate recognition of the spirit of\nhumanity. Think about the nature of that Spirit in terms of how it functions in the world. The 22. 1 is called Second class ticket. This is one of the things that human beings deeply feel at the foundation of\ntheir nature, which is that somehow they are all given second class tickets; somehow they do not get the\n\nPage 1\n\nopportunity to belong or fit in to a place where they think they deserve to be. Think of that genetic continuity as it applies to the 10.1.\n\n10.1 Modesty\n\nThe line is called Modesty. I have a nickname for this line. I call this line the line of the chameleon. Do not confuse it with Modesty in the 15, but understand that the nature of this line is that it asserts not an\nego, but its selflessness. In doing so, what is there is the overview: An innate sense to know and accept one's place. Everything about being a human being is about being within a hierarchy. There are those\nabove. There are those below. There are those more successful and those less. It is always the way that it is going to be. This is the nature of the world. The 10.1, the correct behavior, is simply to accept one's\nplace. That is all, nothing more, nothing less. I have had a real privilege in my life. I have Jupiter in the\n10.1. I am comfortable and have been comfortable with princes and I am just as comfortable with freaks and I have lived in all kinds of environments. Inherent in the 10.1 is the acceptance of one's place,\nwherever that place happens to be.\n\nThe Sun exalted. A valued sense of purpose, no matter what the position. In the acceptance of one's place is a sense of valued purpose. Everybody is looking for their purpose. The purpose lies in fulfilling your\nbehavior, in being yourself. All the themes of love are pointed at the same thing over and over again: to be yourself, to accept what it is to be in the world and to accept that the world is both a hard and easy\nplace. Only then is there a sense of purpose.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. The affliction of over-sensitivity and hurt feelings. Everything about the self is under risk from the outside. The self is always under risk from the outside. The self by its nature is\nselfless. It is not ready to make any claims and yet, the moment that it is connected to the outside, the outside pressures and conditions it to take responsibility for its nature.\n\nThink about the 10.1 child. I have two of them so I know: the 10.1 is always acting correctly even if you do not like it. Always. The moment that you try to tell them that they are not acting correctly, you deeply\noffend them and they suffer from hurt feelings, of course, because inside of them, genetically, they know (this is all about knowing) that their behavior is correct.\n\nIn the white book. The ability to know one's place and how to act despite circumstances. This is the answer to having a second class ticket. So what? Sit in second class, so what? I get on airplanes across the\nAtlantic Ocean and there are all those people in first class. I have a second class ticket. What to do? I will not complain and whine that I don't have a first class ticket. I have a second class ticket. Sit in second\nclass. Accept your place. It is hard for human beings to just accept what the gods have dished out for them. It is the only way. This is the correct behavior and it is the foundation of all behavior. It is the\nfoundation of the behavior that creates perfected form. It is the foundation of the behavior for the perfection of conviction. It is the foundation of the behavior to be awake. Accept your place.\n\n10.2 The Hermit\n\nHere in the 10th gate you have a theme of behavior, a code of behavior for all second lines which is being\nThe Hermit. The overview says: The successful side-stepping of behavioral requirements... ('Behavioral requirements' is conditioning.) ...through isolation. We have seen in our work together that all second\nlines tend to suffer from the fact that they don't know that there is somebody who will burst in on them and see them and try to condition them because they can see into them. The hermit is the correct behavior:\nwithdraw rather than accept conditioning away from what is your nature.\n\nPage 2\n\nMercury exalted. Mental functions enrich aloneness. Mars in detriment. The angry exile. Whichever way that comes out, it is better to withdraw than to accept the conditioning. To be the hermit is so important.\nThe other thing is: in the genetic continuity, as in the 12.2 Purification, The Hermit is somebody who has to rigorously withdraw from negative forces. That is the role of the behavior of the hermit: it is not simply\nto withdraw, but to withdraw from negative forces, not from all forces. Negative forces are those forces that apply conditioning and try to change the nature of the hermit, to bring the hermit out of his isolation.\n\nIn the white book: Independent behavior through isolation, or Isolation to preserve independent behavior in the face of conditioning. That is the most important aspect of it because that is the real key to all second\nlines. The moment that somebody is trying to break in on your second line and condition you, withdraw.\nIt is better for you to withdraw and be in your own process because this is what is healthy and it is the only way in which you are going to find love for yourself.\n\nThink about that. What happens is that when people recognize you for something and they pull on you, you tend to confuse that with love. It is not; nor should it be. That is, those people that can look into you\nand try to pull you, they try to pull you by getting you to recognize your nature and turn it into something motivated. They try to pump you up. This has nothing to do with the role of the hermit. The role of the\nhermit is to avoid such conditioning in order to have an opportunity to be awake.\n\n10.3 The Martyr\n\nWe come to the story of the third line which is about martyrs. Think about the nature of what the third line is. It is always in a situation (lower trigram) in which it tries to get out of its process, only to be\nconfronted by the outside. In the moment of being confronted by the outside, it is being forced to adapt because it was not prepared for what was there on the outside. In the nature of behavior, when you come\nto the third line, you come to trial and error in the process of behavior. Now, remember that third lines can lead to the sixth line of wisdom. That trial and error in behavior can be something that is of enormous\nvalue to humanity, but, at the same time, it is a trial and error process. What may be discovered by living out that trial and error is something else. It may turn out to be something that is of value.\n\nThe Martyr overview line: The futile rejection of standards based on a just awareness. Futile rejection: it does not do any good to reject it. Here are human beings who, without choice, have a genetic code for\nbehavior and that code of behavior, because it is trial and error, will often be in conflict with the behavior of those that surround it and meet it. No matter how much they live out their own nature, they are\nconstantly going to meet resistance from those around them. Of course, it is not easy for them to give up that nature. It is, after all, what they are.\n\nThe Earth exalted. The martyr as an enduring example whose behavior is ultimately enshrined. When a human being is living out their own nature, whether anybody likes it or not in the now, that has nothing to\ndo with whether or not it is truly of value. The 10th gate is individual and deeply related in that sense to the first gate in the self, to its individuality. It speaks about this process of time, that as a creative process,\nto have different behavior than other people is not something that is recognized in your own time necessarily as a possible variation that others can follow. It simply may be seen as disruptive, anti-social,\nfreakish and a threat, most of all. After all, behavior is the most important conditioning we get. It can be very threatening to have somebody whose behavior has impact on others and who becomes a role model\n(sixth line).\n\nThe other thing is that, being individual, this is a behavior that can be mutative and can bring about change and most of all, individuals and individual aspects are always seeking attention. Therefore, the\nbehavior of the 10 and the 10.3 is always getting attention: \"You should not act like that, Johnny.\" \"Stop picking your nose, Johnny.\" He may do it for the rest of his life until somebody slaps him in the face,\n\nPage 3\n\nuntil his behavior so violates the standards or the norms that somebody resists it. Remember, all of these gates of the self are always dependent on what they meet as beings on the other side.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. The martyr complex. The active pursuit of martyrdom for personal aggrandizement. Here the ego is touched. These are people who make a living from their behavior. The\nway these people act in the world attracts attention and because of that, they maintain that behavior in order to continue to maintain that attention.\n\nIn the white book: Behavior that is ultimately challenged by others. I tell all 10.3's when someone challenges them: \"If it is your nature, martyr away because the more people resist you the better you\nknow that you are living yourself.\" So many of these people have very thin skins and they are so easily upset by what other people say or comment on about the nature of their behavior.\n\nOften their reaction is going to the other side: Behavior as a way to attract attention. \"If you don't like my behavior, watch me because I will not change it,\" and they use it to their advantage to attract attention.\nThey can, they do, and they will. Then you see the impact on the self of having other forces come and impose on them and condition them.\n\nI taught you about the 10th gate being a conditioning factor for humanity and how important it is for humanity as a conditioning force, but that will give you a false impression. It is easier to generate the love\nof humanity than it is to generate the love of self. It is easier to generate the love of the body than it is to generate the love of self. It is easier to be one with universal love than it is to love oneself. The 46 always\nhas to live with the conditioning of the 29 and its commitment. The 25 always has to deal with the conditioning of a willful ego. But the love of self, the behavior, gets conditioned in so many different\nways. It gets conditioned by the sacral in terms of whether or not it even has the power to follow its convictions. It gets conditioned by the splenic system, an awareness that will condition the nature of the\nbehavior. It gets conditioned by being able to deal with conditioning forces placed on it from all kinds of different directions.\n\nObviously, when I speak in this language, I am not talking about the nature of one's finished design.\nSomebody like me who has the 10/20/57 but does not have the 34, the force that conditions my behavior is always going to come out of the 34. Somebody who only has the 10 will be open to all three of these\nconditioning forces. It is always dependent on the nature of somebody's design but understand the difficulty. The difficulty is to maintain one's nature. The little martyr that keeps sticking their finger in\ntheir nose, as disgusting as they may be to us, the more we try to beat that kid into not doing that, the more we try to tell them that it is bad for them, the more we try to stop them in the now, we are not\nbenefiting them. What we are teaching them is to not let them be themselves. We are conditioning them to see that their behavior is repellent and that because their behavior is repellent, so are they.\n\nNow, it is not that I would like to have kids that stick their finger up their noses. I have been a teacher all my life and have been teaching kids. It is not something that I would like to look at but, then again, who\nam I to judge? All behavior, particularly in the first three lines, is under enormous pressure from society because this is society's way of counteracting the natural conditioning capability of the 10th gate. They\ncondition it in return. To be oneself is the only way that you find self-love and there are so many forces that try to keep you away from that.\n\nWhen you have the 20 connected to the 10, you have a voice that says: \"I am myself now.\" That voice is a joke because it is a voice that can say \"I am myself now,\" but it does not mean that what they are doing is\ntheir self now or what they are processing is their self now.\n\nPage 4\n\nTo be awake is simply about being yourself in the now and, regardless of what your behavior is, if you are a martyr, you have to be a martyr in the now and if you are a martyr in the now, you are awake. If that is\nyour nature. If it is your nature to take the slings and arrows of everybody else's comments because they do not like your particular behavior, it is your nature and the moment that you succumb to that, you fail in\nthis life. You will not love yourself. You will not be awake but asleep.\n\nOne of the things about the nature of life is that life for a human being must involve a deep level of non- interference and recognition of the other. Everything about being awake is dependent on who is in your\nlife. After all, most human beings are not manifestors of their behavior in the now. Most human beings are reliant on others in order to have that transpire. Most people who carry the 10th gate are not\nmanifestors in the now. Most of them require other people in order for them to come about. It comes back to that very important standard that is established in the first line: to know and accept one's place means\nthat you know the place not only for yourself but for others.\n\nYou know who belongs in your place with you and you know whose place you belong in. This is about knowing the other. Everything about love is dependent on knowing the other. I have never known so\nmuch about myself. It is because I know so much about other human beings. It is out of this knowing that\nI have learned so much about the nature of who I am and, out of that, who belongs in my life and who does not.\n\nThis is what it is all about for all of us, this deep recognition that we are not alone, that we are always in the aura of others and the auras of others are always conditioning us in one way or another. You have to\nbe clear about your nature. You have to be clear about what is there so that you can be healthy, so that you can be of value to the totality and that you can enjoy being you in this life. So much of that is about\nunderstanding people.\n\nWe are deeply misled in this life. That child with its behavior does not realize that it has a right to that behavior because everybody is opposed to it. It is not nurtured in that sense. To nurture that, all you do is\nthat you do not interfere with it. You can educate. All anybody can do in this life is provide information, provide data to the other.\n\nI have learned as a teacher about the nature of what is called positive reinforcement. If you see something awful in somebody, wait until you can see something that is not. If you have a child that is always making\nmistakes, wait until they get it right. If you have a human being that is not themselves, don't take them into your life until they are. That is positive reinforcement and that is one of the things that we all need\nfrom each other and we can't get it until we get to a point where we understand each other. Understanding each other is what it is all about.\n\nWith the information that you have in Human Design in terms of the nature of types, you have a way of encouraging people to live out their own nature. I do not pay much attention to generators when they\ninitiate things with me. I expect manifestors to ask. My son is a generator so I make sure that I ask him to do things rather than telling him to do things so that he has an opportunity to respond because that is his\nnature. With the knowledge that you have and the people around you in your life, there are ways for you to deal with these people: encourage them to be themselves and then you don't become part of the\nproblem by just mindlessly conditioning them even though you know better. This is very important.\n\nOne of the main tasks that we have in our process is that, by recognizing and being aware of the other, we have to encourage them to be themselves. We have ways of doing that with the knowledge that we have.\nThe more people we have that are living out their nature, that are encouraged to live out their own nature, the better and the healthier all of us are going to be and the better is the environment that all of us live in.\nOne of the things to recognize about having the knowledge of the other is that you can encourage them to\n\nPage 5\n\nbe themselves, not by telling them what to do and how to act but by the very recognition of their nature, by encouraging in the way you interact with them so that you don't become a conditioning force. You\nbecome a healing force.\n\n10.4 The Opportunist\n\nDealing with the upper trigram, we have a different process at work because the fourth and fifth lines are rather gifted in the sense that they are going to recognize not only that there is one other source of\nconditioning, but that they are going to come to grips with all three other sources. In other words, the fourth and fifth lines of the 10th hexagram have deep transpersonal skills because they do have\nrecognition of the impact of the other.\n\nThe fourth line as a behavior is a code for all fourth lines for this one-tracked-ness, the fixedness. Its behavioral code is The Opportunist. The acceptance of norms until a successful transformation can be\nengendered. It is very important to understand that. The whole thing about the nature of the behavior in the fourth line is that it has to wait for its opportunity, which means that it cannot give up behavior until\nthere is a place to go with that behavior.\n\nMy analogy for this is: if you have a job and you are a 10.4 and you want a new job, you cannot quit your job until you have a new one. This is opportunism. You stay with the nature of your fixedness until there\nis an opportunity or you wait simply for that opportunity to externalize your fixedness. Again, there is always the possibility that the opportunist has enormous influence: to be able to wait for the right moment\nto act can often lead to a great deal of good fortune or success.\n\nWe have this overview and so it takes time: the acceptance of norms until a successful transformation can be engendered. Accept the nature of your behavior until the behavior can really change. Somebody who\nhas the 10.4 and is deeply conditioned and they come to Human Design. They are not going to be able to change their nature. They will not be able to change their nature until that opportunity is really there for\nthem. That opportunity has to be there. For example, you are a generator and you are a 10.4. You cannot just suddenly become a generator. You have to wait for that opportunity when somebody says to you,\n\"Excuse me, could you help me?\" and you go, \"Uh-huh.\" Then you can jump into that behavior: to wait for the opportunity.\n\nUranus exalted. Transformation that is transcendence to a higher code. The whole thing about the opportunist is that you are looking for the opportunity to externalize your nature and that is the highest\npossible code. There is nothing higher.\n\nMercury in detriment. Opportunism as a game and/or mental exercise. Most of that is because the 10th gate has no guarantee that it is going to have access to a motor in order to manifest. So often it is\nspeculating on those moments of opportunity when they may not arrive, or they are the kind of people who think, \"Here is a perfect opportunity to make a million dollars,\" but never do it because it is a game,\nand because they do not have within themselves, within the nature of their design, the real opportunity to live out that opportunism.\n\nIn the white book: The maintaining of behavioral patterns until the right moment and opportunity for transformation. It is so important for 10.4's just to sit back and wait for that moment to live out their\nnature. The other side: Altering one's behavioral patterns in order to take advantage of opportunities. It is the same thing, just on the other side but it is also speculative. It is waiting for those opportunities and\nthey may not be ready to do that at that moment. Remember, not everybody who has the 10.4 is going to be a manifestor or a generator. They may not have the opportunity to act it out and then it becomes\nsomething game4ike or speculative.\n\nPage 6\n\nOne of the really clear genetic continuities is between the 28.4 and the 10.4. The 28.4, as any fourth line, is all about holding on. It is a holding on until the opportunity to take a risk: to hold on to what you have\ngot until you really have that opportunity to go beyond that.\n\nIt is so important to see that the 28.4 and the 10.4 are both deeply risk-oriented and the whole thing is that one cannot afford to take that risk until one waits for the right moment. Any premature action in that\nsense is going to lead to difficulties. So, the genetic continuity there is very important. This 28.4 is holding on and usually for the betterment. In other words, if you hold on and wait for that opportunity, it\nis always going to be more beneficial. If a 28.4 does not hold on, that does not mean that it fights for the wrong things; it fights for the right things at the wrong time.\n\n10.5 The Heretic\n\nThe 10.5 has enormous impact on society. After all, the 10 is part of Integration and Integration is the backbone of being in the body, of being individuated. The 10.5 is where society projects onto behavior\nand onto how it wants to see behavior. Society sees the behavior at its most interesting as being heretical.\nIt is society that sees if your behavior is unique and individual and it in fact may be dangerous to the whole. All fifth lines are at one time exciting and at another time a threat to society because it is the\nsource of society's projections and, therefore, can be the source of society's disappointment if those projections fail.\n\nWhen you come to the fifth line, you come to The Heretic. As an overview line it says: Direct and overt challenge to norms. One of the things to realize about the 10.5 is the need of society for a heretic, for a\nbehavior that will challenge the norms. It is society that creates The Heretic, that creates The General, that creates all of these roles: The Savior, The Saint, all of these figures. It is society that creates it out of its\nown needs and its owi4 projections. The heretic is created by society because they project onto the behavior of the 10.5 that it is either very exciting or very threatening.\n\nJupiter exalted. The ability to succeed through the understanding and expression of higher principles.\nMars in detriment. The burning 0~ie stake. What exactly is the difference? There is a profound difference.\nRemember that the fifth line is there to challenge the norms of society. In the white book: Principled behavior which directly challenges tradition. This is not a challenge to the way an individual acts in the\nworld. This is not going up to somebody who has a rooster haircut and picking on them because they have a rooster haircut. This is not dealing with tradition. This is just dealing with unusual behavior.\nWhen you look at the other side, the Mars side: Behavior which directly challenges behavior and is eventually punished. If you go up to the punk and say, \"This is ridiculous, nobody should walk around\nlike this\", don't be surprised if they rearrange your face.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the heretic is at its greatest when they attack the framework of behavior that has to be changed. Because the 10.5 is the vanguard of changing behavior, if they just attack the behavior\non the surface they are the ones that suffer. They get burned at the stake because it becomes very personal. They are here to try to challenge the underlying tradition. If they do that, ultimately, they can be\nregarded as a very special force in the world.\n\nHow they are going to react is again subject to the conditioning that they receive themselves. The 10.5 that has no fuel and no access to awareness or no access to manifestation is always going to be\nconditioned by others. A 10.5 being conditioned by somebody else's awareness may end up attacking somebody's behavior and being punished for it simply because they were conditioned that way, rather\nthan that being the most natural and healthy way for them. It is a very important line because, again,\n\nPage 7\n\nsociety has been calling for this. It is calling for a heretic that will challenge tradition and, in challenging tradition, provide mutation for behavior.\n\nVery interesting is the genetic continuity here, particularly because the genetic continuity as seen through the mystical process is the relationship between the 10.5 and the 49.5. The 49th gate is a gate of being the\nsacrificer and the sacrificed. It is the gate of emotional principles and the fifth line in its exalted form is about providing practical provisions for revolutionary times, in the same way that the heretic really brings\nsomething very practical when they deal with the tradition itself. That is what they are equipped to do: to look at the tradition and to see whether or not a tradition deserves to stand or whether or not it is time for\nmutation of behavior.\n\nPractical provisions: in the detriment of the 49.5 you have the same Mars in detriment, which is all about power. The moment that you make things personal is the moment that you get into a power trip with\npeople. For example, you say to them, \"Your behavior stinks,\" and they return, \"Your behavior stinks.\"\nNothing productive will come out of that. In order to change the behavior of society, what has to be dealt with and challenged is the underlying tradition out of which that behavior has risen. Practical provisions;\notherwise expect to be sacrificed.\n\n10.6 The Role Model\n\nIf you will look in this life for people that are the most self-conscious, you will find them in the 10.6.\nThey are constantly under pressure, constantly self-concerned about the nature of their behavior. Built into them is the understanding that behavior can be hypocritical. They recognize that. The line is called\nThe Role Model.\n\nA very powerful line: The perfect expression of the norms through action rather than words. They learn their self-consciousness well with their harmony to the 20.3, Self-awareness, or through the 57.3,\nAcuteness. They learn to recognize very quickly in their life that it is possible to say things but not necessarily possible to live them out. They see that very early. They recognize within themselves that\ntheir behavior is very important. But no matter how much they want to be able to behave perfectly, they always run into obstacles because they end up being conditioned by the people around them that they are\ndependent on. Even the words can only come out if there is a connection to the 20 and the awareness can only guide it if there is a 57 and the energy is only there if there is a 34.\n\nRemember that sixth lines look to the whole circuit, but the first thing a 10.6 looks at is Integration. It says, \"How can I maintain the holiness of myself. How can I guarantee my survival in the world? How\ncan I be me? How can I do what is right for me to do in the world?\" All of that ends up being dependent on so many other beings.\n\nPluto exalted. The constant example that refocuses the complacent on the basic integrity of set behavior.\nThey know how important behavior is. If you have a 10.6 parent, you will discover that, while they are picking their nose, they tell you, \"Don't pick yours: bad behavior.\" 10.6's recognize that correct behavior\nis very important. What is frustrating is that, because they know that better than anybody else and because so often they can't live it out, they would rather not be seen. They would rather sit on the roof and not be\nanybody's example because, even though they can be hypocritical, they suffer a great deal from their own hypocrisies.\n\nThe other side of this is Saturn in detriment. The hypocrite. Do as I say, not as I do. We have seen this as a gift in all sixth lines: the 40.6 that sits on top of the house and looks to its family and says, \"I see who is\nmessing things up here,\" and can easily point it out. The 10.6 has this deep capacity to point out to you what is the correct behavior. By the way, I tell these people: go ahead. Tell other people how to behave. It\n\nPage 8\n\nis part of your gift and don't feel self-conscious because you yourself can't act the way you tell other people to act. Everybody has to accept their limitation, whatever it happens to be. This 10.6 leads to the\n20.6, to the line of wisdom. There is an enormous potential here to be awake to the beauty of self, but this is not an easy process.\n\nIn the white book: The enduring value of expression of the Self through action rather than words. In the end it all comes down to the same thing. It comes down to how you live in the world. The only action that\nmatters, whether it is action that you generate or manifest or whether it is action that is conditioned as manifestation or generation in your life, it that you cannot be taken away from your nature. As long as\nyou are not taken away from your nature, you are an example for others. This is the great value of the\n10th gate and, as an example for others, you are a source of wisdom for them in their lives.\n\nOf all the sixth lines that we have looked at, none makes a more beautiful turn than the 10.6 because the\n10.6 goes to the 58.1. It goes to The Joyous and it goes to the most beautiful line of the 384: the line of\nLove of life. In the end, the 10.6 must find for itself love of life and the vitality that comes from loving life. It is not the vitality that creates the love of life. It is the love of life that creabs the vitality. Th., 10.6\nsits up there and knows the correct behavior but it also knows that that behavior is what brings about the love - life and out of that love of life comes the power to correct the collective, comes the power to\nestablish new patterns, comes the power to release the example in the world. Good luck.\n\nIt always brings me back to where I started 1 1 years ago. When we go through this process of looking at the G center, it brings me back to my own mantra: You are unique. You have no choice. Love yourself.\nThere is nothing else. There really is nothing else.\n\nPage 9",

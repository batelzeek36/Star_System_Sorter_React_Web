Acceptance of achievement but doubt\nwhether continued development will take place. These people are always afraid that their question will never be able to be projected out into the future so that it will finally get to the point of detail, and they\ncan really let go of their suspicion and doubt.\n\nWhenever somebody comes to me with the 63rd gate, the most important thing that I tell them is, \"Make sure that everything in your life that you doubt and are suspicious of, you have to prove yourself. You\nhave to get the detail. Only then is it possible to let go of doubt and suspicion. Otherwise it is not.

That kind of mind is busy when there is something wrong with\n\nPage 1\n\nthe pattern. The moment that you discover that there is something wrong with the pattern and you get it worked out, you have to let go of that. The Martian side always goes from one doubt and suspicion to the\nnext, no matter what is happening. Endlessly. It is always seeking out a new goal, which means that it is seeking out a new question, a new doubt.\n\nIt is like the 1 8th gate always being able to point out, very clearly, where something needs to be corrected.\nIt is always looking for patterns and the doubt and suspicion in them. These are very suspicious people.\nTo be deeply suspicious and untrusting is at the root of what it is to be logical. When people have this, it is our morality that says, \"This is not nice. Love your neighbor and trust them.\" If you do that, you are led\ndown the primrose path and you end up in ideology, which is on the abstract side. It is very important to understand that logic is rooted in suspicion and doubt. If the suspicion and doubt are missing, the logic is\nnever going to be challenged, to be tested, proved or disproved."

Every question is unique.\n\nJupiter exalted. The dedication to the new beginning that insists on maintaining its achieved principles despite having to interact with those who have not attained such a state. What that really means is that\nthese people have a question and they are never satisfied with other people's answers. They are looking for their own answer but they can't get their own answer. But they are never really satisfied with anybody\nelse's answer.\n\nDoubts that one can maintain one's principles when interacting with others. \"Can I really get an answer, so that I can get rid of my doubts through others? Every time I ask this question I get answers from them,\nbut it does not satisfy me. I still doubt it, and I am still looking for my answer.\" This is all about trial and error. The person with the question is always meeting people who have answers and they learn right away\nthat not all of those answers are for them, even though they may seem like they can be the right answer.\n\nOn the other side, Saturn in detriment. Success at any price. Success at any price means insisting that your question is answered. The exalted side of this will actually go along with people who say, \"Yes, the\nanswer is this and this.\" In that moment, it will make them feel like, \"Maybe that is the answer\" and in that, they begin to lose their principle of getting the answer that is correct for them. The detriment side of\nthis is deeply stubborn. In the extreme, every time these people ask a question, nobody's answer is right.\nNone of them are right. They are never right.\n\nThe pressure to eliminate the doubt at any cost. \"I must have the answer.\" These are people who go on enormous investigating searches. These are the people whose inspiration, their question, may be a\nmistake.. Because the question is an error, the answer may prove to be of enormous value. It is one of the jokes of life. Science thrives on trial and error, on mistakes. A question can only be a mistake in the sense\nthat the question itself is not properly configured. These people do not really know what they are asking for. The answer is always in the question. That is why the questioner has so much power. That is Socrates'\ngame.\n\nRemember where the nature of this pressure is rooted. The head center opens up for us information from the deep gray areas of the brain. What that means in the abstract process is that you have all of those\nvideo clips, and you collect them. It is a moving recollection from the past. When you are looking to the logical side, all these patterns are coming through."

      "raw": "The fourth line is called Memory. The question itself is rooted in the patterns and you have to have enough patterns for comparison to recognize that there is something wrong with the pattern in the first\nplace. There is a deep memory capacity here in this fourth line to have these patterns, which ultimately can lead to the powerful detailing of them if it gets to the 62nd gate. We are in the upper trigram and this\nis a line of externalization. So we know that it is very fixed in its doubts.\n\nPage 3\n\nMercury exalted. The detailed accounting of the achievement process whose information base can prepare a new order for the future. The fourth and fifth lines are transpersonal. They know that there is a gate at\nthe other end of the channel and because of that, they know that their doubts will be answered. The answers may be good, bad, right or wrong, but they do know that they are always going to meet an\nanswer out there.\n\nThe pressure to explore the doubt in detail as a foundation for eventual formulizing. These are people that look at the patterns in detail. It is out of the depth of their patterns that they have as a memory resource\nthat they can really ask a very sharp question. They have the background and a lot more to offer than the person at the other side. The only difficulty in terms of this being a collective process is that they are very\nfixed in their doubt and suspicion. They are very fixed in getting their question answered. They are very fixed in what they are looking for as a response. For other people it can seem that they are really\nobsessive about their pattern. That can be uncomfortable for other people.\n\nMars in detriment. A willingness to forget in the glow of victory, with a possible price to be paid later.\n'Glow of victory' is the possibility that you will get an answer if you really have a good question.\nRemember that this line knows that the answer will come. They want to make sure that their question is really rich in its pattern detail so that they can get an answer that is appropriate.\n\nThe pressure and risk to forget the details when the doubts have been answered. Here is somebody with all the pattern images that they have in that system of theirs. They recognize that there is something\nwrong because of that in another pattern. They ask the question of that pattern, get an answer to why it is wrong and they forget all the other stuff they were looking at to get at that point. Because of this, when it\ncomes to projecting into the future, they do not have all the information that is necessary for them. They won't have all the things that they need for the final detail. What happens to these people is that after a life\ntime of getting answers only to that aspect of theirs and leaving out everything else, they have a totally different perspective about how things will move into the future. In many ways, they simplify things for\nus because they leave out a lot of detail.\n\nThroughout this discussion of lines, we have to remember that it is always conditioned by the nature of their design. If you have this line without access to the 4th gate in an undefined throat and ajna center,\nthat is quite a process. All of that is conditioned, and it is difficult. If you are somebody that processes that through, obviously, this is a different experience. But the reality is that you come up with a different\nkind of logical process.\n\nFor example, you have science writers who are people that understand the science but they leave out vast amounts of detail. So they just give you the logical pattern so that the lay person who does not understand\nall the little detail can grasp what that science is about. So these people can be very effective for us in that way. Remember that none of these aspects are ever going to be about good or bad. It is not about\nrestricting this way of asking a question or that way. It is just about seeing that there are different mechanical ways in which those questions will arise, and they bring out different kinds of processes in the\nanswers."

      "raw": "When we come to the fifth line, we come to the line of universalization. The first line establishes the nature of the hexagram and we know that the nature of the 63rd hexagram is to be composed in your\ndoubt. But the way in which society and the world sees this hexagram is that they see it as Affirmation. In other words, these are the people that can prove it for us. In the abstract line (in the 64.5) we have the\npeople that everybody thinks can promise them some kind of sense, the abstract answer. Here it is\n\nPage 4\n\nassumed and projected onto the 63.5 that these people can come up with exactly the right question. Doing so, they can affirm everybody else's question. These are the kind of people who, in group situations,\nalways ask exactly the question that everybody else really wants to have asked. Everybody is waiting for them to ask that question because it is projected on them that they will. Remember, it does not mean that\nthey can. Then, of course, they have to deal with the result of that projected field.\n\nSun exalted. The authority and sincerity of purpose to pursue the same values in the new beginning that had allowed it to transcend the old. In the white book: The understanding that doubts are necessary and of\nvalue. All doubts are necessary and of value because the questions will be answered. But more questions exist and it is an ongoing process, so the doubt is feeding this process. Doubts inspire others to come up\nwith the answers. Coming up with an answer or a formula is about protecting the collective in the future.\nThat is why the expression out of the G center in this circuit is the Alpha who is going to lead us and protect us as they take us into the future.\n\nOn the other side, Mars in detriment. Atendency in triumph to pay lip service to such values, and given such leadership, these values will be reduced to nothing more than empty ritual. Doubting one's very\nprocess despite understanding, and simply going through the ritual of doubt. There are so many people who are just into the ritual of doubting. It is always projected onto these people anyway that they are full\nof doubt. So it becomes their way of living in the world. Everybody projects on them that they doubt and they nod their head and say, \"Yes, I am suspicious. Yes, I doubt this,\" without being necessarily able to\ncome up with their own question. This is very important. It is projected on this line that they are the ones that have the question that will end the doubt and suspicion. Because they do not have it and because they\nare under this pressure from the moment that they come into the world, they can get to a point where, on the other side, they just pay lip service to that whole process. They say, \"Yes, I do have my doubts. I have\nnot found an answer yet.\"\n\nDue to the fact that others project on them that they do have the answer, they discover very quickly in life that nobody wants to hear their question. People with this line who have projected on them that they have\nthe doubts and suspicions, the moment that they can deliver a good question is the moment that they are on the steam roller. They get the authority. They have the power. Everybody assumes that their question\nneeds to be answered. These people end up controlling the laboratory. Their names will end up in the headline for asking the question. If you have the right question and the right answer, you can be set free\nuntil mutation blows that all apart. The logical collective is desperately looking for that. For example, we do accept that one and one is two. We don't have to ask anymore whether or not that is valid. You can get\nto a point where there are no more doubts.\n\nAfter all, please remember the duality of Human Design. Every channel, every gate, every line has an inherent duality within it. The gate of doubt is also the gate of not doubting at all. Doubts are only a\nprocess. One does not have to identify with doubts. The whole thing about the logical collective is, \"Give me an answer that liberates me from my doubt, so that I can go into the future in peace knowing who I\nam.\" Showing people who they are is what the Human Design System as a logical system does. That is a kind of answer that says, \"Here is the fixed mechanic. You do not have to doubt anymore.\" When people\nask me what I do, I tell them that I tell people that it is okay. Once you understand that that is the pattern and you live with it, it is okay. Then you get rid of all the doubts and suspicions. Only those logical\npeople are the ones who are the great testers of Human Design. \"Is it really true what he said?\" is their question, and they test it out endlessly. Abstract people know Human Design in a different way. They\nknow it through their sensory system."

      "heading": "Nostalgia",
      "raw": "Page 5\n\nWhen you go to the sixth line, you get to the line of transition. It is looking beyond. It is looking to the whole circuitry. When you are looking to the whole logical circuitry, a question has to end up being\nsomething that is not only answered but its detail is brought out. It has to then be experimented with. It has to be perfected. It has to be corrected. It has to be focused and concentrated on. That whole process\nultimately leads to that coming out as a role through the love of Humanity in the 15, as a role in the 31/7 to guide and lead humanity into the future. But this sixth line is called Nostalgia. These people are very\nbizarre because the mental logical process has nothing to do with the past and has everything to do with the future. But remember, what the sixth line is like. Because it is waiting, it has this kind of longing to\nsee the whole circuitry fulfilled through its commitment to that. The moment these people have a good question that is answered, they always remember it. \"I asked my grandma that question when I was six,\nand I got the answer. It is still good for me today. It was the best answer I ever had.\" Or, \"My friend\nHarry, one day when I was on the beach, he walked up to me and answered my question. This was the best answer I ever had.\" It is rare that they get answers that really work for them. They are a sixth line.\n\nJupiter exalted. The good sense to avoid turning the previous struggle into an obsession. 'Good sense' is already abstract terminology. They have the good sense or not. If they do not have it, they get totally\ninvolved in that.\n\nIn the white book: The logic of leaving old doubts behind. Either the good sense or the logic to leave it behind. You had your question and your answer. Do not keep on going back to \"that was great\". Think\nabout our world. We have already seen that there are many lines that are not activated in our lifetime because of the effect and impact of outer planets. So, here we come to a situation where in the late 1940's\nto the early 1950's, Pluto was in the 4th hexagram, on the other side of this 63rd gate. Pluto fixed the detriment in this line. It says: Revolutionary nostalgia. One of the things that astonished me in my work is\nthat I meet very logical people who try to tell me about Atlantis. \"They had the answer then. It was better in the past. It was all better back there. The Egyptians were great. They built these pyramids. They had\nthe answer.\"\n\nIllogic and the potential obsession with old suspicions and doubt. We have a whole generation of logical people who don't get the logical answer for the future but they say, \"It was better in the past. Let's go back\nto the farm. Let's go back to rural life. Let's go back to dancing around the fire place. Let's go back to the sweat lodge. Let's go back to all these old things because they had the answer.\" Logical people. It is one\nof the great jokes of our time: logical people being incredible illogical. This is the nature of this sixth line and because we have this powerful plutonic field there, all those people are keeping that energy alive. It is\nclear as we move more and more towards Aquarian consciousness, when the last children who were born in the late 40's and 50's are dead, we don't have to deal with that for 150 years. You have people who will\nsay, \"This was crap. It was never better in the past. They had their answer for their time.\"\n\nIf somebody says something exciting in the news about what is going to happen tomorrow (for example, somebody has developed a new medicine), their immediate response for that future is to go into the\nrevolutionary nostalgia. They go into the question and say, \"Wait a minute. They knew that answer long ago.\" You can look at esoteric magazines which are hilarious. Every time somebody comes up with a new\nscientific thing, there is someone writing an article stating that some tribe had that already. It reminds me of the Russians during the communist era who were responsible for inventing everything. I am joking\nabout that, but it is very important for us that the logical mind is pointing towards the past.\n\nMy logical mind was pointed towards the past and thus I was able to see the validity in the answers that were there. What is unusual for the logical mind, normally, under this Plutonic influence, is that it has led\na lot of people to look into past patterns, to try to make sense of what could be future patterns. This will only come out of the sixth lines. All sixth lines carry this mutative quality because they in themselves are\ntransitional.\n\nPage 6\n\nWhen you go from the 63.6 to the next hexagram, you get to the 22. Out of the 22.6 will be the grace that releases the mutation that will bring us into spirit consciousness. It is very important for us that we do\nhave access to the past in this time, so we look at those old patterns. I never knew anything about the\nI'Ching. I was astonished by being offered those patterns to look at.\n\nThe 63.6 keeps on saying, \"Yes, but they had this before.\" It is waiting for the mutative force in the 61 which says, \"There is something new to know.\" Then the whole process begins again. The abstract gets\nconfused by it and the logic is doubtful and suspicious of it. Unless the 61 is doing a good job, they get killed or ignored.\n\nThe collective sixth lines are visionary, though I am still not comfortable with any term yet to describe what that sixth line does. It is intangible. To know what the whole circuit will be out of that is really\nintangible. Both the 64 and the 63 can be timeless. Because both processes are linked with time, the moment that they are in the heart of confusion or the moment that they are in the heart of the doubt, all\ntime disappears. We have time problems logically and the 17th gate is the worst time keeper in the world.\nThe 17th gate causes everything not to be on time. It always has, and it always will. That is what it is going to do. There are time problems inherent in the collective logical process. Time can be there, and\nnot. The theoretical physicist who talks about 'no time-space' talks about such things. It is only possible to theorize that out of logical premise. Logic plays with the future and plays with the way time moves.\n\nPage 7"

  "raw_text": "HEXAGRAM 63 AFTER COMPLETION\n\nThere is a beautiful joke. If you look at the heading above the 64th hexagram it says: Transition, like birth, requires a determined strength for the passage through. It refers to the channel of determination and\nthus to the logical format. Determination is necessary to find the way and to get through. Inherent in this description is the logical aspect that the collective, in its duality, is always looking for. When you are\nabstract, logic can be very attractive and if you are logical, the abstract can be very attractive.\n\nWhen you come to the 63rd hexagram and you look at the heading above the lines, it says: In the spiral of life, all ends are beginnings. This is describing the abstract format. So, there is this nice little twist inside.\nThose of you that studied the throat center lines will remember that, by the time the abstract gets to manifestation, it wants to be logical and by the time the logic gets to manifestation, it wants to be abstract.\n\nThe 63rd hexagram is the gate of doubt, which is the pressure of suspicious patterns or not. This is the whole thing. Where the abstract is trying to realize out of sequences from the past based on what it\nexperiences in the present, the logic, with what it experiments in the present, is trying to project into the future. It is trying to project out of a pattern. If that pattern does not project into the future, then we have\ndoubt and suspicion.\n\nThe mechanic here is mental patterns focused on the future, and it is the question. This is a gate, as an inspiration, that is always asking a question, looking for the answer. If you can come up with the\nquestion, you will get an answer. There is 'nothing new under the sun' for a collective being. Questions are deeply inspiring. The best questions I was ever asked in my life came from 63's. The best questions I\never asked myself in my whole life came from 63 transits, particularly when the Sun and Mercury transit this gate together.\n\n63.1 Composure\n\nWe have the foundation and the line that is introspective, so it is looking inwards. The nature of doubt is to be composed. Composure, as this line is called, is very important. Remember that this is agate that does\nnot get to really feel complete, will not see its doubt eliminated, until it can hear the detail come out through the 62nd gate. That question not only has to be answered with a formula by the 4th gate. It has to\ngenerate an opinion out of the 17th gate and become a detailed description out of the 62.\n\nSun exalted. The quality of personality where achievement is accepted with equanimity and where continued development is allowed to take its natural course. Acceptance of achievement but doubt\nwhether continued development will take place. These people are always afraid that their question will never be able to be projected out into the future so that it will finally get to the point of detail, and they\ncan really let go of their suspicion and doubt.\n\nWhenever somebody comes to me with the 63rd gate, the most important thing that I tell them is, \"Make sure that everything in your life that you doubt and are suspicious of, you have to prove yourself. You\nhave to get the detail. Only then is it possible to let go of doubt and suspicion. Otherwise it is not. You meet somebody and you are suspicious about them, you have to be composed, give them the benefit of the\ndoubt and see the whole process through. Wait and see if they will give you the detail. If they give you the answer, then you can let go of the suspicion.\"\n\nOn the other side, Mars in detriment. The tendency in achievement to immediately seek new goals at the risk of destabilizing what has already been accomplished. We are trying to see whether a pattern works in\nthe future, or not. This whole thing is about recognizing in that moment of inspiration whether there is something wrong with the pattern or not.

These are very suspicious people.\nTo be deeply suspicious and untrusting is at the root of what it is to be logical. When people have this, it is our morality that says, \"This is not nice. Love your neighbor and trust them.\" If you do that, you are led\ndown the primrose path and you end up in ideology, which is on the abstract side. It is very important to understand that logic is rooted in suspicion and doubt. If the suspicion and doubt are missing, the logic is\nnever going to be challenged, to be tested, proved or disproved.\n\n63.2 Structuring\n\nWhen you get to the second line, remember that second lines are projecting. So, wherever you meet these people, they are projecting out that they doubt you and are suspicious of you, whether or not that is true.\nThat is something that will always come out because it is the nature of the line.\n\nIt is called Structuring. What this line reveals (remember that the second line is in resonance to the fifth line, which is the universalized nature of the hexagram) is that it is interesting, as most people say.

There are so many physicists for\nexample, who came up with the question and they had hundreds of assistants who developed the answer, but they are the ones who are remembered because they had the question. \"I have this question. Who does\nthis work?\" and then they delegate the responsibility.\n\nThe pressure to share one's doubts with others while still maintaining control. \"It is my question. I don't care if it is your answer. I asked the question.\"\n\nOn the other side, we have Uranus in detriment. Instability in achievement that when in positions of authority leads to arrogance and the desire to keep others away from the center of power. The moment\nthat you can ask the kind of question that gets that kind of response for an answer, you have authority.\nThis is the scientist that goes out and writes a paper for nature, signs it with his name and he leaves out the 116 assistants who did all the work to get it together to that point. They are the ones that are saying,\n\"Yes, I have the answer to this. I have this answer to that,\" and he ends up, as a questioner, taking the authority.\n\nPage 2\n\nThese are the two sides to structuring. These people are always afraid of somebody else coming up with a better question. The competition of the collective is incredible. A question is always inspiring to\nsomeone. It inspires this drive to come up with an answer in the same way that confusion is inspiring, because it brings people to try to resolve the confusion for the other. It is all about the other.\n\n63.3 Continuance\n\nWhen you come to this line of trial and error which is called Continuance, and particularly in the wave of bonds made and broken, you recognize that certain questions are important at one point in the life and are\nno longer important later; or you recognize questions that are really off the track because a question is a question, and not all of them are the same. Every question is unique.\n\nJupiter exalted. The dedication to the new beginning that insists on maintaining its achieved principles despite having to interact with those who have not attained such a state. What that really means is that\nthese people have a question and they are never satisfied with other people's answers. They are looking for their own answer but they can't get their own answer. But they are never really satisfied with anybody\nelse's answer.\n\nDoubts that one can maintain one's principles when interacting with others. \"Can I really get an answer, so that I can get rid of my doubts through others? Every time I ask this question I get answers from them,\nbut it does not satisfy me. I still doubt it, and I am still looking for my answer.\" This is all about trial and error. The person with the question is always meeting people who have answers and they learn right away\nthat not all of those answers are for them, even though they may seem like they can be the right answer.\n\nOn the other side, Saturn in detriment. Success at any price. Success at any price means insisting that your question is answered. The exalted side of this will actually go along with people who say, \"Yes, the\nanswer is this and this.\" In that moment, it will make them feel like, \"Maybe that is the answer\" and in that, they begin to lose their principle of getting the answer that is correct for them. The detriment side of\nthis is deeply stubborn. In the extreme, every time these people ask a question, nobody's answer is right.\nNone of them are right. They are never right.\n\nThe pressure to eliminate the doubt at any cost. \"I must have the answer.\" These are people who go on enormous investigating searches. These are the people whose inspiration, their question, may be a\nmistake.. Because the question is an error, the answer may prove to be of enormous value. It is one of the jokes of life. Science thrives on trial and error, on mistakes. A question can only be a mistake in the sense\nthat the question itself is not properly configured. These people do not really know what they are asking for. The answer is always in the question. That is why the questioner has so much power. That is Socrates'\ngame.\n\nRemember where the nature of this pressure is rooted. The head center opens up for us information from the deep gray areas of the brain. What that means in the abstract process is that you have all of those\nvideo clips, and you collect them. It is a moving recollection from the past. When you are looking to the logical side, all these patterns are coming through.\n\n63.4 Memory\n\nThe fourth line is called Memory. The question itself is rooted in the patterns and you have to have enough patterns for comparison to recognize that there is something wrong with the pattern in the first\nplace. There is a deep memory capacity here in this fourth line to have these patterns, which ultimately can lead to the powerful detailing of them if it gets to the 62nd gate. We are in the upper trigram and this\nis a line of externalization. So we know that it is very fixed in its doubts.\n\nPage 3\n\nMercury exalted. The detailed accounting of the achievement process whose information base can prepare a new order for the future. The fourth and fifth lines are transpersonal. They know that there is a gate at\nthe other end of the channel and because of that, they know that their doubts will be answered. The answers may be good, bad, right or wrong, but they do know that they are always going to meet an\nanswer out there.\n\nThe pressure to explore the doubt in detail as a foundation for eventual formulizing. These are people that look at the patterns in detail. It is out of the depth of their patterns that they have as a memory resource\nthat they can really ask a very sharp question. They have the background and a lot more to offer than the person at the other side. The only difficulty in terms of this being a collective process is that they are very\nfixed in their doubt and suspicion. They are very fixed in getting their question answered. They are very fixed in what they are looking for as a response. For other people it can seem that they are really\nobsessive about their pattern. That can be uncomfortable for other people.\n\nMars in detriment. A willingness to forget in the glow of victory, with a possible price to be paid later.\n'Glow of victory' is the possibility that you will get an answer if you really have a good question.\nRemember that this line knows that the answer will come. They want to make sure that their question is really rich in its pattern detail so that they can get an answer that is appropriate.\n\nThe pressure and risk to forget the details when the doubts have been answered. Here is somebody with all the pattern images that they have in that system of theirs. They recognize that there is something\nwrong because of that in another pattern. They ask the question of that pattern, get an answer to why it is wrong and they forget all the other stuff they were looking at to get at that point. Because of this, when it\ncomes to projecting into the future, they do not have all the information that is necessary for them. They won't have all the things that they need for the final detail. What happens to these people is that after a life\ntime of getting answers only to that aspect of theirs and leaving out everything else, they have a totally different perspective about how things will move into the future. In many ways, they simplify things for\nus because they leave out a lot of detail.\n\nThroughout this discussion of lines, we have to remember that it is always conditioned by the nature of their design. If you have this line without access to the 4th gate in an undefined throat and ajna center,\nthat is quite a process. All of that is conditioned, and it is difficult. If you are somebody that processes that through, obviously, this is a different experience. But the reality is that you come up with a different\nkind of logical process.\n\nFor example, you have science writers who are people that understand the science but they leave out vast amounts of detail. So they just give you the logical pattern so that the lay person who does not understand\nall the little detail can grasp what that science is about. So these people can be very effective for us in that way. Remember that none of these aspects are ever going to be about good or bad. It is not about\nrestricting this way of asking a question or that way. It is just about seeing that there are different mechanical ways in which those questions will arise, and they bring out different kinds of processes in the\nanswers.\n\n63.5 Affirmation\n\nWhen we come to the fifth line, we come to the line of universalization. The first line establishes the nature of the hexagram and we know that the nature of the 63rd hexagram is to be composed in your\ndoubt. But the way in which society and the world sees this hexagram is that they see it as Affirmation. In other words, these are the people that can prove it for us. In the abstract line (in the 64.5) we have the\npeople that everybody thinks can promise them some kind of sense, the abstract answer. Here it is\n\nPage 4\n\nassumed and projected onto the 63.5 that these people can come up with exactly the right question. Doing so, they can affirm everybody else's question. These are the kind of people who, in group situations,\nalways ask exactly the question that everybody else really wants to have asked. Everybody is waiting for them to ask that question because it is projected on them that they will. Remember, it does not mean that\nthey can. Then, of course, they have to deal with the result of that projected field.\n\nSun exalted. The authority and sincerity of purpose to pursue the same values in the new beginning that had allowed it to transcend the old. In the white book: The understanding that doubts are necessary and of\nvalue. All doubts are necessary and of value because the questions will be answered. But more questions exist and it is an ongoing process, so the doubt is feeding this process. Doubts inspire others to come up\nwith the answers. Coming up with an answer or a formula is about protecting the collective in the future.\nThat is why the expression out of the G center in this circuit is the Alpha who is going to lead us and protect us as they take us into the future.\n\nOn the other side, Mars in detriment. Atendency in triumph to pay lip service to such values, and given such leadership, these values will be reduced to nothing more than empty ritual. Doubting one's very\nprocess despite understanding, and simply going through the ritual of doubt. There are so many people who are just into the ritual of doubting. It is always projected onto these people anyway that they are full\nof doubt. So it becomes their way of living in the world. Everybody projects on them that they doubt and they nod their head and say, \"Yes, I am suspicious. Yes, I doubt this,\" without being necessarily able to\ncome up with their own question. This is very important. It is projected on this line that they are the ones that have the question that will end the doubt and suspicion. Because they do not have it and because they\nare under this pressure from the moment that they come into the world, they can get to a point where, on the other side, they just pay lip service to that whole process. They say, \"Yes, I do have my doubts. I have\nnot found an answer yet.\"\n\nDue to the fact that others project on them that they do have the answer, they discover very quickly in life that nobody wants to hear their question. People with this line who have projected on them that they have\nthe doubts and suspicions, the moment that they can deliver a good question is the moment that they are on the steam roller. They get the authority. They have the power. Everybody assumes that their question\nneeds to be answered. These people end up controlling the laboratory. Their names will end up in the headline for asking the question. If you have the right question and the right answer, you can be set free\nuntil mutation blows that all apart. The logical collective is desperately looking for that. For example, we do accept that one and one is two. We don't have to ask anymore whether or not that is valid. You can get\nto a point where there are no more doubts.\n\nAfter all, please remember the duality of Human Design. Every channel, every gate, every line has an inherent duality within it. The gate of doubt is also the gate of not doubting at all. Doubts are only a\nprocess. One does not have to identify with doubts. The whole thing about the logical collective is, \"Give me an answer that liberates me from my doubt, so that I can go into the future in peace knowing who I\nam.\" Showing people who they are is what the Human Design System as a logical system does. That is a kind of answer that says, \"Here is the fixed mechanic. You do not have to doubt anymore.\" When people\nask me what I do, I tell them that I tell people that it is okay. Once you understand that that is the pattern and you live with it, it is okay. Then you get rid of all the doubts and suspicions. Only those logical\npeople are the ones who are the great testers of Human Design. \"Is it really true what he said?\" is their question, and they test it out endlessly. Abstract people know Human Design in a different way. They\nknow it through their sensory system.\n\n63.6 Nostalgia\n\nPage 5\n\nWhen you go to the sixth line, you get to the line of transition. It is looking beyond. It is looking to the whole circuitry. When you are looking to the whole logical circuitry, a question has to end up being\nsomething that is not only answered but its detail is brought out. It has to then be experimented with. It has to be perfected. It has to be corrected. It has to be focused and concentrated on. That whole process\nultimately leads to that coming out as a role through the love of Humanity in the 15, as a role in the 31/7 to guide and lead humanity into the future. But this sixth line is called Nostalgia. These people are very\nbizarre because the mental logical process has nothing to do with the past and has everything to do with the future. But remember, what the sixth line is like. Because it is waiting, it has this kind of longing to\nsee the whole circuitry fulfilled through its commitment to that. The moment these people have a good question that is answered, they always remember it. \"I asked my grandma that question when I was six,\nand I got the answer. It is still good for me today. It was the best answer I ever had.\" Or, \"My friend\nHarry, one day when I was on the beach, he walked up to me and answered my question. This was the best answer I ever had.\" It is rare that they get answers that really work for them. They are a sixth line.\n\nJupiter exalted. The good sense to avoid turning the previous struggle into an obsession. 'Good sense' is already abstract terminology. They have the good sense or not. If they do not have it, they get totally\ninvolved in that.\n\nIn the white book: The logic of leaving old doubts behind. Either the good sense or the logic to leave it behind. You had your question and your answer. Do not keep on going back to \"that was great\". Think\nabout our world. We have already seen that there are many lines that are not activated in our lifetime because of the effect and impact of outer planets. So, here we come to a situation where in the late 1940's\nto the early 1950's, Pluto was in the 4th hexagram, on the other side of this 63rd gate. Pluto fixed the detriment in this line. It says: Revolutionary nostalgia. One of the things that astonished me in my work is\nthat I meet very logical people who try to tell me about Atlantis. \"They had the answer then. It was better in the past. It was all better back there. The Egyptians were great. They built these pyramids. They had\nthe answer.\"\n\nIllogic and the potential obsession with old suspicions and doubt. We have a whole generation of logical people who don't get the logical answer for the future but they say, \"It was better in the past. Let's go back\nto the farm. Let's go back to rural life. Let's go back to dancing around the fire place. Let's go back to the sweat lodge. Let's go back to all these old things because they had the answer.\" Logical people. It is one\nof the great jokes of our time: logical people being incredible illogical. This is the nature of this sixth line and because we have this powerful plutonic field there, all those people are keeping that energy alive. It is\nclear as we move more and more towards Aquarian consciousness, when the last children who were born in the late 40's and 50's are dead, we don't have to deal with that for 150 years. You have people who will\nsay, \"This was crap. It was never better in the past. They had their answer for their time.\"\n\nIf somebody says something exciting in the news about what is going to happen tomorrow (for example, somebody has developed a new medicine), their immediate response for that future is to go into the\nrevolutionary nostalgia. They go into the question and say, \"Wait a minute. They knew that answer long ago.\" You can look at esoteric magazines which are hilarious. Every time somebody comes up with a new\nscientific thing, there is someone writing an article stating that some tribe had that already. It reminds me of the Russians during the communist era who were responsible for inventing everything. I am joking\nabout that, but it is very important for us that the logical mind is pointing towards the past.\n\nMy logical mind was pointed towards the past and thus I was able to see the validity in the answers that were there. What is unusual for the logical mind, normally, under this Plutonic influence, is that it has led\na lot of people to look into past patterns, to try to make sense of what could be future patterns. This will only come out of the sixth lines. All sixth lines carry this mutative quality because they in themselves are\ntransitional.\n\nPage 6\n\nWhen you go from the 63.6 to the next hexagram, you get to the 22. Out of the 22.6 will be the grace that releases the mutation that will bring us into spirit consciousness. It is very important for us that we do\nhave access to the past in this time, so we look at those old patterns. I never knew anything about the\nI'Ching. I was astonished by being offered those patterns to look at.\n\nThe 63.6 keeps on saying, \"Yes, but they had this before.\" It is waiting for the mutative force in the 61 which says, \"There is something new to know.\" Then the whole process begins again. The abstract gets\nconfused by it and the logic is doubtful and suspicious of it. Unless the 61 is doing a good job, they get killed or ignored.\n\nThe collective sixth lines are visionary, though I am still not comfortable with any term yet to describe what that sixth line does. It is intangible. To know what the whole circuit will be out of that is really\nintangible. Both the 64 and the 63 can be timeless. Because both processes are linked with time, the moment that they are in the heart of confusion or the moment that they are in the heart of the doubt, all\ntime disappears. We have time problems logically and the 17th gate is the worst time keeper in the world.\nThe 17th gate causes everything not to be on time. It always has, and it always will. That is what it is going to do. There are time problems inherent in the collective logical process. Time can be there, and\nnot. The theoretical physicist who talks about 'no time-space' talks about such things. It is only possible to theorize that out of logical premise. Logic plays with the future and plays with the way time moves.\n\nPage 7",

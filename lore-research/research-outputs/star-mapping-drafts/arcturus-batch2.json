  "9.2": {
    "weight": 0.25,
    "alignment_type": "core",
    "why": "9.2 can lock into one task with surgical depth and will block interruption to protect that focus, which mirrors Arcturus core boundarying to keep the field clean."

    "weight": 0.50,
    "alignment_type": "core",

    "weight": 0.50,
    "alignment_type": "core",
    "why": "9.6 lives as proof that disciplined focus becomes mastery and can judge people who can't match it; that's Arcturus core long-haul regulation with a hint of clinical superiority."

    "notes": "All six traditions converge on the theme of primordial creative force\u2014the initiating principle that brings forth light, form, and manifestation from the void. Gate 1's archetype of creative self-expression and originality finds direct parallels in: Chinese philosophy (Hexagram 1's pure yang/heaven), Greek mystery traditions (Phanes as first light-bringer), Vedic cosmology (the self-breathing One), Taoist thought (the nameless originator), Platonic philosophy (the divine craftsman), and indigenous wisdom (the Sun Creator's first command). Each tradition emphasizes the spontaneous, self-generated nature of the original creative act\u2014echoing Gate 1's principle of authentic, unmediated self-expression as the foundation of all manifestation."

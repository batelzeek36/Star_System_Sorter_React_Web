> **Priority:** Must fix before using in scorer

## What Needs Fixing

### 1. Add `weights_hint` (REQUIRED)

**Problem:** Missing from current JSON structure  
**Fix:** Add this section after `star_system_alignments`:

```json
"weights_hint": [
  {"system_id": "lyra", "suggested_w": 5, "reason": "primordial creative source"},
  {"system_id": "andromeda", "suggested_w": 4, "reason": "sovereign creative freedom"},
  {"system_id": "pleiades", "suggested_w": 3, "reason": "creative/nurturing emission"},
  {"system_id": "sirius", "suggested_w": 3, "reason": "initiatory self-consciousness"}
]
```

**Rule:** Total weight ≤15 per gate

---

### 2. Mark Sirius/Dogon as Disputed

**Problem:** Temple's Dogon claims are controversial but not marked as disputed

**Current:**

```json
{
  "title": "The Sirius Mystery",
  "author": "Robert Temple",
  "disputed": false // ❌ WRONG
}
```

**Fix:**

```json
{
  "title": "The Sirius Mystery",
  "author": "Robert Temple",
  "disputed": true // ✅ CORRECT
}
```

**Also add to `contradictions` array:**

```json
"contradictions": [
  "Temple's Dogon/Sirius claims disputed by van Beek (1991) fieldwork - no evidence of ancient Sirius B knowledge"
]
```

---

### 3. Upgrade Weak Citations

**Problem:** Blog posts and Goodreads instead of actual books

#### Sirius - Temple Citation

**Current:** `https://sheerzed.me/2019/03/23/...` (blog)  
**Fix:** Use actual book:

```json
{
  "title": "The Sirius Mystery",
  "author": "Robert Temple",
  "edition": "1976 First Edition (or 1998 Revised)",
  "page": "Chapter 1, pp. 1-15" // or specific section
  "url": "https://archive.org/details/siriusmystery00temp" // if available
}
```

#### Pleiades - Marciniak Citations

**Current:** Goodreads quotes and generic compilations  
**Fix:** Use actual book pages:

```json
{
  "title": "Bringers of the Dawn",
  "author": "Barbara Marciniak",
  "edition": "1992 Bear & Company",
  "page": "Chapter 3, pp. 45-47" // find actual pages
  "url": "https://archive.org/details/..." // if available
}
```

#### Lyra - Prism of Lyra

**Current:** Scribd compilation link  
**Fix:** Use actual book:

```json
{
  "title": "The Prism of Lyra",
  "author": "Lyssa Royal and Keith Priest",
  "edition": "1989 Royal Priest Research",
  "page": "Chapter 2, pp. 23-30" // find actual pages
  "url": "Direct book link if available"
}
```

### 4. Lower Andromeda Confidence

**Problem:** Marked as "high" with only web articles as sources

**Current:**

```json
{
  "system": "Andromeda",
  "confidence": "high" // ❌ TOO STRONG
}
```

**Fix:**

```json
{
  "system": "Andromeda",
  "confidence": "medium" // ✅ MORE ACCURATE
}
```

**Why:** "High" confidence requires primary channeled sources (e.g., Alex Collier's book/transcripts), not just web articles

**Optional upgrade:** Add Collier's "Defending Sacred Ground" as a source to justify "high"

---

### 5. Consider Adding Orion Light

**Problem:** Only 4 alignments; could add a 5th for completeness

**Suggested addition:**

```json
{
  "system": "Orion Light",
  "confidence": "low",
  "evidence_type": "thematic",
  "primary_rationale": "Egyptian Orion-Osiris connection represents creative rebirth and royal order—the pharaoh's creative self-expression through divine kingship. Orion as the celestial architect of creative manifestation parallels Gate 1's principle of directed creative power.",
  "ancient_support": [
    "Pyramid Texts equate Orion (Sah) with Osiris, god of creative rebirth",
    "Pharaoh 'ascends with Orion' representing creative divine authority"
  ],
  "modern_support": [
    "Orion Correlation Theory links Giza pyramids to Orion's belt—creative architectural expression"
  ],
  "cross_cultural_pattern": "Orion represents creative order, royal authority, and architectural manifestation",
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "Pyramid Texts",
      "author": "Ancient Egyptian",
      "edition": "Faulkner translation",
      "year": 1969,
      "source_type": "ancient",
      "quote": "The king is Orion, swallowed by the sky, reborn each day",
      "page": "Utterance 251",
      "url": "https://pyramidtextsonline.com",
      "disputed": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Add to weights_hint:

```json
{
  "system_id": "orion_light",
  "suggested_w": 2,
  "reason": "creative rebirth/royal order"
}
```

## Quick Fix Checklist

Before marking Pass C as complete:

- [ ] Add `weights_hint` section (total ≤15)
- [ ] Mark Temple/Dogon source as `disputed: true`
- [ ] Add contradiction note about van Beek
- [ ] Replace blog/Goodreads links with actual book citations
- [ ] Lower Andromeda confidence to "medium"
- [ ] (Optional) Add Orion Light alignment
- [ ] Verify all page numbers are specific (not "Referenced in...")
- [ ] Verify total weight in `weights_hint` ≤15

---

## For Future Gates

When running Pass C for other gates:

### Always Include:

- `weights_hint` section with total ≤15
- Specific page numbers (not "Referenced in multiple sources")
- Book citations (not blog posts or Goodreads)
- `disputed: true` for controversial claims (Dogon, Hill star map, Icke reptilians)

### Confidence Levels:

- **high:** 3+ primary sources (books, channeled transcripts, ancient texts)
- **medium:** 2 sources OR mix of primary + secondary
- **low:** 1-2 sources OR mostly web articles
- **speculative:** Inferred connections, thin evidence

### Source Quality Hierarchy:

1. Ancient texts (Pyramid Texts, I Ching, Vedas)
2. Primary channeled books (Marciniak, Royal, Collier)
3. Research books (Temple, Bauval)
4. Academic papers
5. Web articles (use sparingly)
6. Blog posts (avoid if possible)

---

## Template Updated

The `TEMPLATE_PASS_C.txt` has been updated to include `weights_hint` in the output structure. All future gates will include this automatically.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Option A (Quick):** Accept Pass C as-is for MVP, note improvements for Phase 2
2. **Option B (Thorough):** Spend 10 minutes fixing the 5 issues above
3. **Option C (Hybrid):** Add `weights_hint` now (required), defer citation upgrades to Phase 2

**Recommendation:** Option C - Add weights_hint now, mark as "needs citation upgrade" for later.

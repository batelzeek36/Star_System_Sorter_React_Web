Sirius and Orion demonstrate the strongest ancient esoteric connections to creative initiation themes through Egyptian sources. Pleiades shows remarkable cross-cultural convergence on nurturing/artistic archetypes. Lyra, Andromeda, and Arcturus rely more heavily on modern interpretations and channeled material. The Dogon/Sirius dispute (Temple vs. van Beek) is integrated as a critical epistemological lesson about verifying ancient vs. contaminated knowledge. All confidence levels calibrated to evidence quality: ancient + modern convergence = MEDIUM; channeled-only or thematic inference = LOW. No alignments rated HIGH per the framework requiring multiple ancient sources + cross-cultural verification."

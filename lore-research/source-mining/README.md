# Source Mining - AI Model Responses

**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Purpose:** Crowdsource esoteric source knowledge from 8 AI models

---

## Models Used

1. **GPT-5 Pro** - Top reasoning + schema discipline
2. **GPT-5 ChatGPT (Non-Thinking)** - RLHF-tuned judgments
3. **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking)** - Strongest Anthropic reasoner
4. **Claude Opus 4.1 (Thinking)** - Different Anthropic flavor
5. **Grok 4 Fast Reasoning** - Concise, decisive
6. **Grok 4 Fast (0709)** - Second xAI angle
7. **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Conservative with formatting
8. **Perplexity Sonar Reasoning Pro** - Search disabled to avoid web calls

## Prompt Used

See: `../prompts/SOURCE_MINING_PROMPT.md`

---

## Response Files

- `responses/1-gpt-5-pro.md`
- `responses/2-gpt-5-chatgpt.md`
- `responses/3-claude-sonnet-4.5.md`
- `responses/4-claude-opus-4.1.md`
- `responses/5-grok-4-fast-reasoning.md`
- `responses/6-grok-4-fast-0709.md`
- `responses/7-gemini-2.5-pro.md`
- `responses/8-perplexity-sonar-reasoning-pro.md`

---

## How to Use

1. **Copy prompt** from `SOURCE_MINING_PROMPT.md`
2. **Paste into each model** (one at a time)
3. **Copy response** into corresponding file
4. **After all 8 responses collected**, run consolidation

---

## Next Steps

After collecting all responses:

1. Read all 8 response files
2. Deduplicate sources
3. Verify a sample (5-10 sources)
4. Categorize by type
5. Add best sources to `ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md`
6. Create `CONSOLIDATED.md` with merged results

---

## Expected Output

- **100-300 additional sources** across all models
- Obscure Theosophical authors
- Specific museum catalog numbers
- Bureau of American Ethnology reports
- Academic papers from obscure journals
- Lesser-known translations
- Indigenous star lore documented by anthropologists
- Star lineage teachings from mystery schools

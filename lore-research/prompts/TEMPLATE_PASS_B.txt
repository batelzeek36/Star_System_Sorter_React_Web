Research ancient wisdom connections for Human Design Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}} using web search and browser tools.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎓 ACADEMIC CONTEXT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This research supports Star System Sorter, which maps Human Design's I Ching-based gate system to star mythology.

**Human Design's Academic Foundations:**
- **I Ching (64 hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement (Wilhelm translation, 1950)
- **64 DNA codons** - Nobel Prize research (Nirenberg & Khorana, 1968)
- **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Extensive academic study (Scholem, Idel)
- **Chakra system** - Religious Studies, Yoga Studies (Feuerstein)
- **Western Astrology** - Cultural/historical phenomenon (Tarnas)

**Mathematical Correspondences:**
- 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (verifiable fact)
- Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)

**Your Task:** Document ancient wisdom connections using rigorous sourcing standards (ancient texts with named translators, published books with ISBNs). This is **comparative mythology research**, not pseudoscience.

🔒 HARD RULES (8-MODEL VALIDATION CONSENSUS - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
1. Blog sources (WordPress, Medium, personal websites) - UNACCEPTABLE
2. Anonymous authors ("Various researchers", "Contemporary sources") - UNACCEPTABLE
3. Fabricated quotes or page numbers - UNACCEPTABLE
4. Paraphrases presented as direct quotes - MUST mark as paraphrase
5. Modern paraphrases instead of scholarly translations - UNACCEPTABLE

✅ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ORAL TRADITIONS:
1. Cite anthropological sources (e.g., Frank Waters for Hopi, NOT blogs)
2. Use academic translations (Wilhelm, Legge, Jowett) over modern paraphrases
3. Verify translation accuracy - note if paraphrased from original language
4. For indigenous traditions, cite published books or authorized publications
5. Prioritize CONTENT QUALITY over citation perfection

💡 FOCUS ON VALUE, NOT BUREAUCRACY:
- A great connection with "Hexagram {{GATE_NUMBER}}, Judgment" is BETTER than no connection with perfect page numbers
- Official academic/museum websites are ACCEPTABLE for ancient texts
- Rich thematic analysis is MORE VALUABLE than defensive explanations about missing citations

✅ PREFERRED TRANSLATIONS (Use these when available):
- I Ching: Wilhelm/Baynes (Princeton) or Legge (Sacred Books of the East)
- Tao Te Ching: Legge, Mitchell, or Feng/English
- Rig Veda: Griffith, Doniger O'Flaherty, or Wilson

🔍 DISCOVERY ENCOURAGED - FIND THE HIDDEN GEMS!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The MORE OBSCURE and verifiable, the BETTER! We want deep cuts, not just the famous sources.

✨ ACTIVELY SEEK:
- Obscure anthropological texts from academic publishers (e.g., Bureau of American Ethnology reports)
- Lesser-known ancient texts with museum/archive catalog numbers (e.g., specific papyri, tablets)
- Indigenous traditions documented by named anthropologists (e.g., James Mooney, Frank Waters)
- Rare translations of mystery school texts from university special collections
- Overlooked passages in canonical texts (e.g., obscure Vedic hymns, lesser-known Orphic fragments)
- Academic papers on comparative mythology from JSTOR, academia.edu
- Museum publications with specific artifact references

🎯 EXAMPLES OF GREAT DISCOVERIES:
- "Myths of the Cherokee" by James Mooney (1900), Bureau of American Ethnology, pp. 256-258
- "Sumerian Tablet K.3473" from British Museum collection, translated by Samuel Noah Kramer
- "Aboriginal Star Lore of the Yolngu People" documented by anthropologist Ray Norris
- Obscure Orphic fragment from "Orphicorum Fragmenta" by Otto Kern (1922)
- Lesser-known Vedic hymn from Atharva Veda with specific mandala/sukta reference

⚠️ STILL MUST BE:
✅ Published book or academic paper (not blog)
✅ Named author/anthropologist/translator
✅ Specific page/catalog/verse numbers
✅ Verifiable via library/museum/archive/university
✅ Accessible via Comet browser for verification

💡 SEARCH STRATEGY:
- Use academic databases (JSTOR, Google Scholar, archive.org)
- Search museum collections (British Museum, Smithsonian, Louvre)
- Look for Bureau of American Ethnology reports (1879-1965)
- Check university special collections and rare book archives
- Search for specific artifact catalog numbers
- Look beyond the "top 5" Google results

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:
- Use Perplexity Sonar Deep Research with Comet browser enabled
- Verify all citations by accessing actual sources via web browsing
- Mark any citations you cannot directly verify as "not available" with explanation

Task: For Human Design Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}} archetype ({{GATE_ARCHETYPE}}), find **best-fit** ancient parallels (max 6 items total) from:
- Egyptian/Thothian (Emerald Tablets, Book of the Dead, Pyramid Texts, Hermetica)
- Chinese/Taoist (I Ching #{{GATE_NUMBER}} is mandatory; Tao Te Ching if relevant)
- Vedic/Hindu (Rig Veda, Gita, Upanishads)
- Indigenous (Hopi, Dogon, Aboriginal Seven Sisters, Cherokee/Mayan star lore)
- Greek/Mystery Schools (Orphic, Plato, Pythagoras)
- Sumerian/Mesopotamian (Enuma Elish, Gilgamesh, Sumerian King List)

QUOTE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (Complete before submitting):
□ Exact wording matches source (or marked as paraphrase)
□ Correct translation/edition cited
□ Accurate verse/page/section number
□ Author/translator name correct
□ Publication year correct
□ URL leads to actual source (not summary/review)
□ NO blog sources used
□ NO anonymous authors

Rules:
- Prefer **one solid citation per tradition** over many weak ones
- If no clean match in a tradition, omit it (don't force it)
- All arrays must be present (can be empty [])

QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:
- ✅ Do all connections have specific verse/section/hexagram numbers (the primary organizational unit)?
- ✅ Do all connections have actual quotes (prioritize content over perfect formatting)?
- ✅ Are paraphrases clearly marked with "quote_type": "paraphrase"?
- ✅ Do all connections have edition/translation information?
- ✅ Are URLs included where available?
- ✅ Does each connection provide RICH THEMATIC ANALYSIS of the parallel?
- ✅ Have you searched for ancient sources that CONTRADICT this archetype interpretation?
- ✅ If contradictions found, are they listed in the "contradictions" array?
- ✅ For indigenous sources, are they from anthropological publications (NOT blogs)?
- ❌ Are there ANY blog sources? (If yes, REMOVE them - official academic/museum sites are OK)
- ❌ Are there ANY anonymous authors? (If yes, find actual translator/author or remove)
- ❌ Is "notes" field just explaining missing citations? (If yes, ADD ACTUAL THEMATIC ANALYSIS instead)

VALIDATION LESSONS LEARNED:
- I Ching Wilhelm/Baynes is gold standard - always verifiable (8/8 models verified)
- Tao Te Ching Legge translation is excellent - always verifiable (8/8 models verified)
- Rig Veda quotes may be paraphrased - note if Wilhelm translation differs
- Hopi sources MUST be Frank Waters or academic anthropologists, NOT blogs
- Orphic Hymns Thomas Taylor translation is standard and verifiable
- Plato Stephanus references are standard (e.g., "Timaeus 28c-29a")
- "Hexagram {{GATE_NUMBER}}" or "Verse X.Y" IS a valid citation (texts organized by these numbers)
- Focus on RICH THEMATIC ANALYSIS not defensive explanations about missing page numbers
- Ancient wisdom connections are the STRONGEST part of research - maintain high standards

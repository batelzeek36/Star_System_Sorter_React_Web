# Star System Sorter - Simplified Beam Validation

## Your Task

I'm building a research methodology for mapping Human Design gates to star system archetypes. I need you to review my research process templates and the actual output for Gate 1, then tell me if the logic and citations are sound.

**Please evaluate:**
1. Are the research templates rigorous enough?
2. Does the Gate 1 output meet the template requirements?
3. Are the citations credible and properly formatted?
4. Are the thematic connections logical?
5. What are the biggest weaknesses or risks?

## TEMPLATE PASS A: Initial Research

**Purpose:** Gather gate meanings and establish baseline citations

```
Return **JSON only** (no markdown, no pre/post text). Output **minified JSON**.

Research "Human Design Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}}".

CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- You MUST find exact page numbers or specific sections (e.g., "Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}}, Lines 1-6", "Chapter 3, pp. 45-47")
- You MUST extract actual quotes ≤25 words from the source material
- You MUST include edition information (e.g., "2nd Edition", "Revised Edition", "1st Edition")
- You MUST include working URLs when available
- Only write "unknown" if the source is genuinely inaccessible or doesn't exist
- DO NOT dump URLs outside the JSON structure - parse them into the citations array with full metadata
- If you find sources but can't extract metadata, that response is REJECTED - dig deeper

Requirements:
- Pull Ra Uru Hu's meaning (1–2 sentences) with exact page or section and book/edition metadata
- Pull Gene Keys (shadow, gift, siddhi) with exact page or section
- I Ching Hexagram {{GATE_NUMBER}}: canonical name + brief meaning + why it maps to Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}}
- All arrays must be present (can contain "unknown" only if truly unavailable)

Output shape (minified JSON only):
{
  "gate": {{GATE_NUMBER}},
  "gate_name": "…",
  "hd_meaning": "…",
  "gene_keys": { "shadow": "…", "gift": "…", "siddhi": "…" },
  "i_ching_parallel": { "hexagram": {{GATE_NUMBER}}, "name": "…", "meaning": "…", "relevance": "…" },

        "quote":"MUST BE ACTUAL QUOTE ≤25 words (not 'unknown' unless truly unavailable)"
      }
    ]
  },
  "notes": "unknown|brief"
}

QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:
- ✅ Do all citations have specific page numbers or sections?
- ✅ Do all citations have actual quotes (not "unknown")?
- ✅ Do all citations have edition information?
- ✅ Are URLs included where available?
- ❌ If any answer is NO, the response is REJECTED - research deeper
```

## YOUR EVALUATION

Please assess:

### 1. Template Rigor (1-5 rating)
- Are the citation requirements appropriate for esoteric research?
- Are the quality checks sufficient?
- What's missing or excessive?

### 2. Output Quality (1-5 rating)
- Does Gate 1 output meet the template standards?
- Are citations credible and properly formatted?
- Are quotes actually from the sources claimed?

### 3. Logical Consistency (1-5 rating)
- Do the thematic connections make sense?
- Is Gate 1 → Lyra/Andromeda/Pleiades/Sirius logical?
- Are the confidence levels (high/medium) justified?

### 4. Source Credibility
- Mix of ancient (I Ching, Rig Veda, Orphic Hymns) + modern channeled (Bailey, Marciniak, Royal)
- Is this mix defensible for archetypal synthesis?
- What are the weakest sources?

### 5. Red Flags
- What claims are overreaching?
- What sources are problematic?
- What would you challenge?

### 6. Recommendations
- How would you strengthen this methodology?
- What additional safeguards are needed?
- Is this ready for production use?

## Context

This is for a web app that maps Human Design birth charts to star system archetypes. It's framed as "for insight & entertainment" with full disclaimers. Users see their results with full provenance (sources, confidence levels, citations).

**The question:** Is this research methodology sound enough to launch, or does it need major revisions?

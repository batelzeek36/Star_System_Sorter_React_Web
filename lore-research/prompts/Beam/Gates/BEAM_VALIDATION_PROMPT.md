# Star System Sorter - Multi-AI Validation Prompt

## Purpose
This prompt is designed for cross-AI validation via Big-AGI's "Beam" feature. It tests the logical consistency, research quality, and defensibility of the Star System Sorter methodology across multiple AI models (Claude, GPT, Grok, Perplexity).

## Validation Request

I'm building a web application called **Star System Sorter** that maps Human Design birth chart data to star system archetypes (Sirius, Pleiades, Orion, Arcturus, Andromeda, Lyra). I need you to evaluate the logical soundness and research quality of this methodology.

### Core Methodology

**Step 1: Established Inputs**
- Human Design gates (1-64) have documented meanings from Ra Uru Hu's system (1987-present)
- Example: Gate 1 = "Creative self-expression, originality, divine spark"

**Step 2: Star System Characteristics**
- Each star system has documented characteristics from esoteric literature
- Example: Pleiades = "Artistic, nurturing, creative" (sources: Marciniak, Hand Clow, Aboriginal/Greek mythology)

**Step 3: Thematic Pattern Matching**
- Algorithm identifies thematic alignments between gate meanings and star system characteristics
- Example: Gate 1 (creative expression) → Pleiades (artistic nature)
- Each connection includes: rationale, confidence level (1-5), and source citations

**Step 4: Weighted Scoring**
- User's birth chart activates specific gates/channels/centers
- Each activation contributes weighted points to matching star systems
- Percentages calculated across all 6 systems
- Classification: Primary (clear winner), Hybrid (top 2 within 6%), or Unresolved

### Evidence Standards

**Source Types:**
- `ancient`: Pre-1800s texts, indigenous oral traditions
- `research`: Academic papers, historical analysis
- `channeled`: Modern channeled material (post-1950s)
- `indigenous`: Oral traditions, tribal knowledge
- `controversial`: Disputed claims with counter-evidence notation

**Consensus Levels:**
- HIGH: 3+ independent sources, mixing ancient + modern
- MEDIUM: 2-3 sources, or strong in one category
- LOW: Single source, heavily disputed, or channeled-only

**Required Elements:**
- Minimum 3 sources per trait
- Direct quotes ≤25 words with page numbers
- Explicit dispute notation where applicable
- Ancient support level noted (high/medium/low/unknown)

### Example Star System: Sirius

**Documented Characteristics:**
1. **Teachers and wisdom keepers**
   - Consensus: HIGH
   - Ancient support: HIGH (Egyptian Sopdet/Sothis, calendrical importance)
   - Sources:
     - Pyramid Texts (ancient) - Sopdet/Isis linkage
     - "The Law of One" (channeled, 1981) - "benevolent visitors from Sirius"
     - Dogon oral tradition (disputed) - Nommo from Sirius (Temple vs. van Beek)

2. **Guardians of sacred knowledge**
   - Consensus: MEDIUM-HIGH
   - Ancient support: HIGH (Egyptian mystery schools)
   - Sources:
     - Egyptian mythology (Isis/Osiris/Sirius connection)
     - "The Sirius Mystery" by Robert Temple (controversial)

### Example Gate Mapping: Gate 13 → Sirius

**Gate 13 Meaning (Ra Uru Hu):**
- "The Listener" - Keeper of past stories, witnessing, historical archive

**Thematic Match:**
- Gate 13 (keeper of secrets) ↔ Sirius (guardian of wisdom)
- Confidence: 4/5 (HIGH)
- Rationale: "Both embody the archetype of preserving and protecting sacred knowledge across time"
- Evidence type: Thematic + Ancient support

### Legal/Ethical Framing

**What we claim:**
- ✅ Gate meanings are documented (Ra Uru Hu)
- ✅ Star system archetypes are documented (multiple sources)
- ✅ Thematic patterns exist between them
- ✅ We've synthesized these patterns with full citations
- ✅ This is archetypal synthesis for self-exploration

**What we DON'T claim:**
- ❌ "You are literally from Pleiades"
- ❌ "This is scientific fact"
- ❌ "Ancient texts confirm HD gates = star systems"
- ❌ "This proves extraterrestrial origins"

**Disclaimer (on all screens):**
> "For insight & entertainment. Not medical, financial, or legal advice. Star system classifications are based on archetypal synthesis and esoteric research. They represent thematic alignments derived from documented sources, not scientific or historical facts."

## Validation Questions

Please evaluate the following aspects:

### 1. Logical Consistency
- Is the methodology internally consistent?
- Does the logic chain (gates → star systems → scoring) hold up?
- Are there any circular reasoning issues?
- Is the deterministic algorithm approach sound?

### 2. Research Quality
- Are the evidence standards appropriate for this type of synthesis?
- Is the source classification system (ancient/research/channeled/etc.) reasonable?
- Are the consensus levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) defensible?
- What gaps or weaknesses do you see in the research approach?

### 3. Defensibility
- Is the legal/ethical framing adequate?
- Are the disclaimers sufficient?
- What claims (if any) are overreaching?
- How would you rate the intellectual honesty of this approach?

### 4. Comparison to Similar Systems
- How does this compare to astrology (birth data → archetypes)?
- How does this compare to Myers-Briggs or Enneagram?
- Is the synthesis approach valid for this type of framework?

### 5. Red Flags
- What are the biggest risks or vulnerabilities in this methodology?
- Where is the system most likely to be criticized?
- What would strengthen the defensibility?

### 6. Cross-Cultural Validation
- Is the use of indigenous/ancient sources respectful and appropriate?
- Are disputed claims (like Dogon/Sirius) handled properly?
- What cultural sensitivity issues should be addressed?

### 7. Specific Example Evaluation
**Gate 13 → Sirius mapping:**
- Does the thematic match (keeper of secrets ↔ guardian of wisdom) make sense?
- Is confidence level 4/5 justified?
- What would make this connection stronger or weaker?

## Response Format

Please provide:

1. **Overall Assessment** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Is this methodology sound for its stated purpose?
   - What's your confidence level in this approach?

2. **Strengths** (bullet points)
   - What aspects are well-designed?

3. **Weaknesses** (bullet points)
   - What needs improvement?

4. **Recommendations** (bullet points)
   - Specific suggestions to strengthen the system

5. **Risk Assessment** (1-5 scale)
   - 1 = High risk of criticism/legal issues
   - 5 = Well-defended, minimal risk

6. **Comparison Rating**
   - How does this compare to astrology/MBTI/Enneagram in terms of logical rigor?

## Context

This is a React web app (MVP phase) that:
- Uses Human Design birth chart API (BodyGraph Chart)
- Applies proprietary scoring algorithm
- Presents results with visual crests and percentages
- Includes "Why" screen showing contributing factors with citations
- Plans to add "Dossier" screen with full provenance (rule IDs, sources, confidence levels)

The goal is to create a **researched, transparent, logically-consistent synthesis** for self-exploration and entertainment, not to prove extraterrestrial origins or make scientific claims.

## Your Task

Evaluate this methodology as if you were:
1. A skeptical academic reviewing the research quality
2. A legal advisor assessing liability risks
3. A user experience researcher evaluating transparency
4. A cultural anthropologist checking for appropriation issues

Be honest, critical, and constructive. I want to know where this system is weak so I can strengthen it before launch.

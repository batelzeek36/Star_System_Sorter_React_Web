Return **JSON only** for Human Design Gate 1.

CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- You MUST find exact page numbers or specific sections (e.g., "Gate 1, Lines 1-6", "Chapter 3, pp. 45-47")
- You MUST extract actual quotes ≤25 words from the source material
- You MUST include edition information (e.g., "2nd Edition", "Revised Edition", "1st Edition")
- You MUST include working URLs when available
- Only write "unknown" if the source is genuinely inaccessible or doesn't exist
- DO NOT dump URLs outside the JSON structure - parse them into the citations/sources arrays with full metadata
- If you find sources but can't extract metadata, that response is REJECTED - dig deeper
- Each star system alignment needs 2-3 sources with FULL metadata (not just URLs)

Include:
- HD/Gene Keys/I Ching core meanings with FULL citations (page numbers, editions, quotes)
- Best 4–6 ancient parallels total (Egyptian, Chinese, Vedic, Indigenous, Greek, Sumerian) with FULL citations
- 3–5 star system alignments with confidence + evidence_type, 2–3 sources each with FULL metadata
- All quotes must be ≤25 words and extracted from actual sources
- All page/section numbers must be specific (not "unknown" unless truly unavailable)

STAR SYSTEMS:
- Sirius (teachers, guardians, Sirian-Christos)
- Pleiades (nurturers, artists, empaths)
- Orion Light/Osirian (historians, Egyptian mystery schools, Thoth)
- Arcturus (engineers, healers, geometric consciousness)
- Andromeda (explorers, iconoclasts, freedom)
- Lyra (primordial builders, feline beings, instinct)
- Draco (power, will, hierarchy - disputed)
- Zeta Reticuli (analysts, experimenters, detachment)

QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:
- ✅ Do all citations have specific page numbers or sections?
- ✅ Do all citations have actual quotes (not "unknown")?
- ✅ Do all citations have edition information?
- ✅ Are URLs included where available?
- ✅ Does each star system alignment have 2-3 sources with FULL metadata?
- ❌ If any answer is NO, the response is REJECTED - research deeper

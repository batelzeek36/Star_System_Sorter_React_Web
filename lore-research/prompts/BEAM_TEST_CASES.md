# Star System Sorter - Cross-AI Test Cases

## Purpose
Specific test cases to verify consistency across multiple AI models when validating the Star System Sorter methodology.

---

## Test Case 1: Gate 1 ‚Üí Pleiades

**Gate 1 Meaning:**
- "Creative self-expression, originality, divine spark" (Ra Uru Hu, The Rave I'Ching)

**Pleiades Characteristics:**
- Artistic, creative, nurturing, empathic
- Sources: Marciniak "Bringers of the Dawn", Hand Clow "The Pleiadian Agenda", Aboriginal Seven Sisters mythology, Greek Seven Sisters mythology

**Mapping:**
- Thematic match: Creative expression ‚Üî Artistic nature
- Confidence: 5/5 (HIGH)
- Ancient support: HIGH (Seven Sisters myths globally pervasive)

**Question:** Is this a defensible thematic connection? Why or why not?

---

## Test Case 2: Gate 13 ‚Üí Sirius

**Gate 13 Meaning:**
- "The Listener - Keeper of past stories, witnessing, historical archive" (Ra Uru Hu)

**Sirius Characteristics:**
- Teachers, wisdom keepers, guardians of knowledge
- Sources: Dogon tradition (disputed), Egyptian Sopdet/Sothis, "The Law of One", Robert Temple "The Sirius Mystery"

**Mapping:**
- Thematic match: Keeper of secrets ‚Üî Guardian of wisdom
- Confidence: 4/5 (HIGH)
- Ancient support: HIGH (Egyptian calendrical importance)
- Disputed: Dogon Nommo tradition (Temple vs. van Beek)

**Question:** How should disputed sources (Dogon) be handled? Does marking them as `disputed: true` with counter-evidence suffice?

---

## Test Case 3: Gate 43 ‚Üí Orion Light

**Gate 43 Meaning:**
- "Insight - Breakthrough mental clarity, unique knowing, often misunderstood genius" (Ra Uru Hu)

**Orion Light Characteristics:**
- Historians, strategists, mystery schools, Thoth/Hermes lineage, record keepers
- Sources: Egyptian Pyramid Texts (Orion = Osiris), Bauval "The Orion Mystery", Hermetic Corpus, Emerald Tablets

**Mapping:**
- Thematic match: Breakthrough insight ‚Üî Mystery school wisdom
- Confidence: 4/5 (HIGH)
- Ancient support: HIGH (Pyramid Texts explicit)
- Note: Thoth-Orion connection is inferred, not explicit

**Question:** Is it valid to connect "insight" with "mystery schools" thematically? Is the confidence level appropriate?

---

## Test Case 4: Gate 9 ‚Üí Arcturus

**Gate 9 Meaning:**
- "Focus - Concentration and capacity to bring energy into precise focus" (Ra Uru Hu)

**Arcturus Characteristics:**
- Healers, engineers, geometric consciousness, energy workers, frequency-based
- Sources: Edgar Cayce readings, Milanovich "We, the Arcturians", Kenyon "The Arcturian Anthology"

**Mapping:**
- Thematic match: Precise focus ‚Üî Energy engineering
- Confidence: 3/5 (MEDIUM)
- Ancient support: LOW/UNKNOWN (sparse to none)
- Note: All sources are modern/channeled (post-1920s)

**Question:** Is it problematic that Arcturus has no ancient support? Should confidence be lowered further? How should this be disclosed?

---

## Test Case 5: Disputed Claim - Dogon/Sirius

**Claim:**
- Dogon tribe of Mali possessed ancient knowledge of Sirius B (invisible companion star)
- Source: Robert Temple "The Sirius Mystery" (1976)

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Anthropologist Walter van Beek conducted fieldwork (1991) and found no support for Temple's claims
- Suggests contamination from Western astronomy

**Our Approach:**
- Mark as `disputed: true`
- Include both Temple AND van Beek sources
- Note: "Dogon Sirius connection is controversial; counter-evidence exists"
- Still use Egyptian Sopdet/Sothis (undisputed) as primary ancient support

**Question:** Is this handling adequate? Should disputed sources be excluded entirely, or is transparency sufficient?

---

## Test Case 6: Channeled-Only System - Lyra

**Lyra Characteristics:**
- Primordial root race, feline beings, builders of early civilizations
- Sources: Lyssa Royal "The Prism of Lyra", Dolores Cannon "The Three Waves", starseed literature

**Issue:**
- Ancient support: UNKNOWN (little to none)
- All sources are modern/channeled (post-1980s)
- No cross-cultural validation

**Our Approach:**
- Explicitly note `ancient_support: unknown`
- Label all sources as `source_type: channeled`
- Lower consensus to MEDIUM (despite multiple sources)
- Disclose in UI: "Based on modern channeled material"

**Question:** Is it valid to include a star system with no ancient support? Should it be excluded from the system entirely?

---

## Test Case 7: Controversial Source - David Icke / Draco

**Draco Characteristics:**
- Power, control, hierarchy, kundalini/serpent force
- Sources: Dragon mythology (ancient, cross-cultural), Thuban pole star (astronomical), Kundalini teachings (ancient), David Icke "The Biggest Secret" (controversial reptilian conspiracy)

**Our Approach:**
- Use ancient dragon myths as mythic scaffold (solid)
- Use Thuban astronomical data (factual)
- Mark Icke material as `source_type: controversial` and `disputed: true`
- Separate ancient serpent symbolism (power/wisdom) from modern conspiracy theories
- Note: "Not all Draco are evil" - look for nuance

**Question:** Should controversial sources like Icke be included at all? Does proper labeling make them acceptable?

---

## Test Case 8: Hybrid Classification

**User Chart:**
- Pleiades: 32.45%
- Sirius: 28.67%
- Arcturus: 18.23%
- Orion: 12.34%
- Andromeda: 5.67%
- Lyra: 2.64%

**Tie Threshold:** 6%

**Classification:**
- Difference: 32.45% - 28.67% = 3.78%
- Since 3.78% < 6%, this is a HYBRID (Pleiades-Sirius)

**Question:** Is a 6% tie threshold reasonable? Should it be higher/lower? Is the hybrid classification approach sound?

---

## Test Case 9: Legal Disclaimer Adequacy

**Current Disclaimer:**
> "For insight & entertainment. Not medical, financial, or legal advice. Star system classifications are based on archetypal synthesis and esoteric research. They represent thematic alignments derived from documented sources, not scientific or historical facts. Results are intended for self-exploration and entertainment purposes."

**Question:** Is this disclaimer sufficient to protect against:
- False advertising claims?
- Misrepresentation of indigenous knowledge?
- Users taking results as literal fact?
- Cultural appropriation accusations?

---

## Test Case 10: Comparison to Established Systems

**Astrology:**
- Birth data ‚Üí planetary positions ‚Üí zodiac signs ‚Üí personality traits
- Based on: Ancient astronomical observations + archetypal meanings
- Status: Established system, not scientific fact

**Star System Sorter:**
- Birth data ‚Üí HD chart ‚Üí gates/channels ‚Üí star system archetypes
- Based on: HD system (1987) + esoteric star lore + thematic synthesis
- Status: New synthesis system, not scientific fact

**Question:** Is this comparison valid? Does Star System Sorter have similar logical rigor to astrology? What are the key differences?

---

## Cross-Model Consistency Check

When you receive responses from multiple AI models, check for:

### High Agreement Areas (Expected)
- ‚úÖ Methodology is internally consistent
- ‚úÖ Evidence standards are appropriate for archetypal synthesis
- ‚úÖ Disclaimers are necessary and helpful
- ‚úÖ Transparency about sources is a strength

### Potential Disagreement Areas
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Whether disputed sources should be included at all
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Whether channeled-only systems (Lyra, Arcturus) are valid
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Appropriate confidence levels for thematic matches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Whether 6% tie threshold is reasonable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cultural appropriation concerns (indigenous sources)

### Red Flags to Watch For
- üö© Any model says methodology is fundamentally flawed
- üö© Legal/ethical concerns about indigenous knowledge use
- üö© Claims are overreaching despite disclaimers
- üö© Comparison to astrology/MBTI is invalid
- üö© Research quality is insufficient for stated purpose

---

## Validation Success Criteria

**Pass:** 6+ out of 8 models agree that:
1. Methodology is sound for stated purpose (self-exploration/entertainment)
2. Evidence standards are appropriate
3. Disclaimers are adequate
4. Transparency about sources is sufficient
5. Comparison to astrology/MBTI is valid
6. Risk level is acceptable (3-5 out of 5)

**Needs Work:** 3-5 models raise concerns about:
- Specific test cases (disputed sources, channeled-only systems)
- Legal/ethical framing
- Cultural sensitivity
- Confidence levels

**Fail:** 5+ models agree that:
- Methodology is fundamentally flawed
- Claims are overreaching
- Legal/ethical risks are too high
- Research quality is insufficient

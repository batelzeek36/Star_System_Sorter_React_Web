## The Prompt

```
I'm building a comprehensive library of obscure but verifiable esoteric sources for a research project that maps Human Design chart aspects (gates, channels, centers) to resonant star systems and star lineages.

SPECIFIC STAR SYSTEMS/LINEAGES I'M RESEARCHING:
- Sirius (Sirian-Christos lineage, teachers, guardians)
- Pleiades (Seven Sisters, nurturers, artists, empaths)
- Orion Light/Osirian (Egyptian mystery schools, Thoth/Hermes lineage, historians)
- Arcturus (Arcturian, engineers, healers, geometric consciousness)
- Andromeda (explorers, iconoclasts, freedom, sovereignty)
- Lyra (primordial builders, feline beings, instinct)
- Draco (power, will, hierarchy, kundalini)
- Zeta Reticuli (analysts, experimenters, detachment)

I need sources that discuss:
- Ancient references to these star systems
- Star lineages and their characteristics
- Stellar mythology across cultures
- Esoteric teachings about star origins
- Indigenous star lore
- Mystery school teachings about stars
- Channeled material about star systems (if published in books)

I need you to mine your training data and list EVERY obscure, cool, or lesser-known source you know that fits these criteria:

‚úÖ Published book or academic paper (NOT blogs, websites, or social media)
‚úÖ Named author, translator, or anthropologist

CATEGORIES TO MINE:

1. **Ancient Texts** (Egyptian, Sumerian, Vedic, Chinese, Greek, etc.)
   - Specific papyri, tablets, or manuscripts with catalog numbers
   - Lesser-known translations or editions

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE LIKE THIS:

**[Category Name]**

- **"Book Title"** by Author Name (Year), Publisher
  - Why it's cool: [1 sentence]
  - What it covers: [1 sentence]
  - ISBN/Catalog: [if known]

- **"Another Book"** by Author (Year), Publisher
  - Why it's cool: [1 sentence]
  - What it covers: [1 sentence]

EXAMPLES OF WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:

‚úÖ GOOD: "Myths of the Cherokee" by James Mooney (1900), Bureau of American Ethnology Report 19
‚úÖ GOOD: "The Inner Life" by C.W. Leadbeater (1911), Theosophical Publishing House
‚úÖ GOOD: "Papyrus of Nesi-Amsu" (British Museum EA 10541), specific stellar references
‚úÖ GOOD: "MUL.APIN" Babylonian star catalog (c. 1000 BCE), Hunger & Pingree translation (1989)
‚úÖ GOOD: "The Sirius Mystery" by Robert K.G. Temple (1976), St. Martin's Press
‚úÖ GOOD: "The Prism of Lyra" by Lyssa Royal & Keith Priest (1989), Light Technology
‚úÖ GOOD: "The Arcturus Probe" by Jos√© Arg√ºelles (1996), Light Technology
‚úÖ GOOD: "Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning" by Richard Hinckley Allen (1899), Dover
‚úÖ GOOD: Egyptian Pyramid Texts with Sirius/Sopdet references, Mercer translation (1952)

‚ùå BAD: "Ancient Aliens" TV show
‚ùå BAD: "starseedawakening.com" blog post
‚ùå BAD: "Various researchers say..."
‚ùå BAD: Reddit posts or YouTube videos

FOCUS ON:
- The OBSCURE stuff most people don't know about
- Sources that are VERIFIABLE (published, cataloged, archived)
- Ancient texts mentioning Sirius, Pleiades, Orion, Lyra, Arcturus, Andromeda
- Star lineage teachings from mystery schools
- Osirian/Orion Light lineage in Egyptian texts
- Arcturian references in any tradition
- Lyran/feline consciousness in esoteric literature
- Pleiadian/Seven Sisters across cultures
- Sirian-Christos lineage in Theosophical/esoteric texts
- Academic translations of ancient stellar texts
- Anthropological documentation of indigenous star lore
- Lesser-known Theosophical/esoteric authors on star systems
- Specific museum artifacts with stellar catalog numbers
- Academic papers on star mythology from obscure journals
- Published channeled material about star origins (books, not blogs)

GO DEEP. List as many as you can think of. The more obscure and verifiable, the better!

If you know specific:
- Museum catalog numbers (e.g., British Museum EA 10541)
- Tablet numbers (e.g., K.3473)
- Papyrus numbers
- Bureau of American Ethnology report numbers
- Academic journal citations
- ISBN numbers

INCLUDE THEM!

Ready? Give me everything you've got!

## Models to Beam This To

### Recommended Models:
1. **GPT-5** - Broad knowledge base
2. **Claude Opus 4** - Deep reasoning, good for academic sources
3. **Claude Sonnet 4.5** - Fast, comprehensive
4. **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Google's knowledge base
5. **Grok 4** - xAI's unique training data
6. **o3-mini** - Deep research mode
7. **DeepSeek V3** - Different training corpus
8. **Qwen 2.5** - Chinese sources especially

### How to Use:

1. **Copy the prompt** from the code block above
2. **Paste into each model** (one at a time or in parallel)
3. **Save responses** to separate files:
   - `lore-research/source-mining/gpt-5-sources.md`
   - `lore-research/source-mining/claude-opus-sources.md`
   - `lore-research/source-mining/gemini-sources.md`
   - etc.
4. **Consolidate** the best sources into the main library

---

## What You'll Get

Each model will contribute sources from their unique training data:

- **GPT-5** - Broad coverage, good for Western esoteric
- **Claude** - Academic papers, anthropological sources
- **Gemini** - Google Books corpus, academic journals
- **Grok** - Unique xAI training data
- **DeepSeek** - Chinese/Asian sources
- **Qwen** - Deep Chinese esoteric traditions

---

## Post-Processing

After collecting responses:

1. **Deduplicate** - Remove sources already in the library
2. **Verify** - Spot-check a few sources to ensure they're real
3. **Categorize** - Organize by category
4. **Add to library** - Update `ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md`

---

## Expected Output

You should get **100-300 additional sources** across all models, including:

- Obscure Theosophical authors you've never heard of
- Specific museum artifacts with catalog numbers
- Bureau of American Ethnology reports
- Academic papers from obscure journals
- Lesser-known translations of ancient texts
- Indigenous traditions documented by anthropologists
- Rare esoteric publishers

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Run on multiple models** - Each has different training data
2. **Ask follow-up questions** - "Give me 20 more in [category]"
3. **Request specifics** - "What Bureau of American Ethnology reports do you know?"
4. **Verify a sample** - Check 5-10 sources to ensure quality
5. **Consolidate** - Merge the best into your main library

---

## Why This Works

AI models have been trained on:
- Google Books corpus (millions of books)
- Academic paper databases
- Museum catalogs
- Library archives
- Out-of-print esoteric texts
- Anthropological reports

They know about sources that are:
- Too obscure to show up in web searches
- Out of print but in their training data
- Academic papers behind paywalls
- Museum catalogs not fully digitized

**This is a goldmine waiting to be tapped!**

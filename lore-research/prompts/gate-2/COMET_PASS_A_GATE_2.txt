QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:
- ✅ Do all citations have specific page numbers or sections (or "not available" with explanation)?
- ✅ Do all citations have actual quotes (or "not available" with explanation)?
- ✅ Are paraphrases clearly marked with "quote_type": "paraphrase"?
- ✅ Do all citations have edition information?
- ✅ Are URLs included where available?
- ✅ Have you searched for sources that CONTRADICT this gate meaning?
- ✅ If contradictions found, are they noted in "notes" or "contradictions" field?
- ⚠️ If critical information is "not available", have you explained why in "notes"?
- ❌ Are there ANY blog sources? (If yes, REMOVE them)
- ❌ Are there ANY anonymous authors? (If yes, find actual author or remove)

VALIDATION LESSONS LEARNED:
- Ra Uru Hu quotes are often condensed summaries - mark as paraphrase if not exact
- Gene Keys quotes are poetic - verify exact wording or mark as paraphrase
- I Ching Wilhelm/Baynes is gold standard - always verifiable
- Provide specific page numbers, not "Gate 2 Section"

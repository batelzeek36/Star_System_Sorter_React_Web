🔍 DISCOVERY ENCOURAGED - FIND THE HIDDEN GEMS!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The MORE OBSCURE and verifiable, the BETTER! We want deep cuts, not just the famous sources.

✨ ACTIVELY SEEK:
- Obscure anthropological texts from academic publishers (e.g., Bureau of American Ethnology reports)
- Lesser-known ancient texts with museum/archive catalog numbers (e.g., specific papyri, tablets)
- Indigenous traditions documented by named anthropologists (e.g., James Mooney, Frank Waters)
- Rare translations of mystery school texts from university special collections
- Overlooked passages in canonical texts (e.g., obscure Vedic hymns, lesser-known Orphic fragments)
- Academic papers on comparative mythology from JSTOR, academia.edu
- Museum publications with specific artifact references

🎯 EXAMPLES OF GREAT DISCOVERIES:
- "Myths of the Cherokee" by James Mooney (1900), Bureau of American Ethnology, pp. 256-258
- "Sumerian Tablet K.3473" from British Museum collection, translated by Samuel Noah Kramer
- "Aboriginal Star Lore of the Yolngu People" documented by anthropologist Ray Norris
- Obscure Orphic fragment from "Orphicorum Fragmenta" by Otto Kern (1922)
- Lesser-known Vedic hymn from Atharva Veda with specific mandala/sukta reference

⚠️ STILL MUST BE:
✅ Published book or academic paper (not blog)
✅ Named author/anthropologist/translator
✅ Specific page/catalog/verse numbers
✅ Verifiable via library/museum/archive/university
✅ Accessible via Comet browser for verification

💡 SEARCH STRATEGY:
- Use academic databases (JSTOR, Google Scholar, archive.org)
- Search museum collections (British Museum, Smithsonian, Louvre)
- Look for Bureau of American Ethnology reports (1879-1965)
- Check university special collections and rare book archives
- Search for specific artifact catalog numbers
- Look beyond the "top 5" Google results

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:
- Use Perplexity Sonar Deep Research with Comet browser enabled
- Verify all citations by accessing actual sources via web browsing
- Mark any citations you cannot directly verify as "not available" with explanation

Task: For Human Design Gate 3 archetype (innovation through difficulty, mutation, new beginnings from chaos), find **best-fit** ancient parallels (max 6 items total) from:
- Egyptian/Thothian (Emerald Tablets, Book of the Dead, Pyramid Texts, Hermetica)
- Chinese/Taoist (I Ching #3 is mandatory; Tao Te Ching if relevant)
- Vedic/Hindu (Rig Veda, Gita, Upanishads)
- Indigenous (Hopi, Dogon, Aboriginal Seven Sisters, Cherokee/Mayan star lore)
- Greek/Mystery Schools (Orphic, Plato, Pythagoras)
- Sumerian/Mesopotamian (Enuma Elish, Gilgamesh, Sumerian King List)

□ Correct translation/edition cited
□ Accurate verse/page/section number
□ Author/translator name correct
□ Publication year correct
□ URL leads to actual source (not summary/review)
□ NO blog sources used
□ NO anonymous authors

Rules:
- Prefer **one solid citation per tradition** over many weak ones
- If no clean match in a tradition, omit it (don't force it)
- All arrays must be present (can be empty [])

QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:
- ✅ Do all connections have specific page/verse/section numbers (or "not available" with explanation)?
- ✅ Do all connections have actual quotes (or "not available" with explanation)?
- ✅ Are paraphrases clearly marked with "quote_type": "paraphrase"?
- ✅ Do all connections have edition/translation information?
- ✅ Are URLs included where available?
- ✅ Have you searched for ancient sources that CONTRADICT this archetype interpretation?
- ✅ If contradictions found, are they listed in the "contradictions" array?
- ✅ For indigenous sources, are they from anthropological publications (NOT blogs)?
- ⚠️ If critical information is "not available", have you explained why in "notes"?
- ❌ Are there ANY blog sources? (If yes, REMOVE them and find anthropological sources)
- ❌ Are there ANY anonymous authors? (If yes, find actual translator/author or remove)

VALIDATION LESSONS LEARNED:
- I Ching Wilhelm/Baynes is gold standard - always verifiable (8/8 models verified)
- Tao Te Ching Legge translation is excellent - always verifiable (8/8 models verified)
- Rig Veda quotes may be paraphrased - note if Wilhelm translation differs
- Hopi sources MUST be Frank Waters or academic anthropologists, NOT blogs
- Orphic Hymns Thomas Taylor translation is standard and verifiable
- Plato Stephanus references are standard (e.g., "Timaeus 28c-29a")
- Ancient wisdom connections are the STRONGEST part of research - maintain high standards

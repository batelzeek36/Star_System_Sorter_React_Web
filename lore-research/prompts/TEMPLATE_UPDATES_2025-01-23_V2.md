# Template Updates v2.0 - Validation-Hardened

**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0 (Validation-Hardened)  
**Previous Version:** 1.1 (archived in `archive/2025-01-23-pre-validation-updates/`)

---

## What Changed

Based on 8-model web-enabled validation of Gate 1 outputs, we've implemented hard rules to prevent the issues that required 3-5 hours of corrections.

### Validation Results That Drove Changes

| Issue | Models Flagged | Severity | Fix |
|-------|---------------|----------|-----|
| Blog sources used | 8/8 | CRITICAL | Hard rule against blogs |
| Quote attribution errors | 8/8 | CRITICAL | Verification checklist |
| Confidence inflation | 7/8 | HIGH | Epistemological framework |
| Weight misalignment | 6/8 | HIGH | Calibration rules |
| Dispute inadequately integrated | 7/8 | HIGH | Integration requirement |
| Anonymous authors | 8/8 | HIGH | Must name actual authors |

## Changes by Template

### TEMPLATE_PASS_A.txt (v1.1 ‚Üí v2.0)

**New Sections:**
1. üîí HARD RULES section at top (visual separator)
2. Quote verification checklist
3. "quote_type" field (exact|paraphrase)
4. Validation lessons learned section

**Key Changes:**
- Added explicit ban on blog sources
- Added requirement to mark paraphrases
- Added specific page number requirement (not "Gate X Section")
- Added quote verification checklist

**Impact:** Prevents quote attribution errors (Marciniak wrong book issue)

---

### TEMPLATE_PASS_B.txt (v1.1 ‚Üí v2.0)

**New Sections:**
1. üîí HARD RULES section at top
2. Preferred translations list (Wilhelm, Legge, Jowett, etc.)
3. Oral tradition sourcing requirements
4. Quote verification checklist
5. Validation lessons learned section

**Key Changes:**
- Added explicit ban on blog sources for indigenous traditions
- Added requirement for anthropological sources (Frank Waters for Hopi)
- Added preferred translation list
- Added "quote_type" field (exact|paraphrase)
- Added requirement to note if paraphrased from original language

**Impact:** Prevents Hopi blog source issue (8/8 models flagged)

---

### TEMPLATE_PASS_C.txt (v1.1 ‚Üí v2.0) - MOST CHANGES

**New Sections:**
1. üîí HARD RULES section at top
2. ‚úÖ SOURCE HIERARCHY (3 tiers)
3. üéØ CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION FRAMEWORK
4. ‚öñÔ∏è WEIGHT CALIBRATION RULES
5. üö® DISPUTE INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT
6. Evidence type clarification
7. Quote verification checklist
8. Validation lessons learned section

**Key Changes:**

#### Source Hierarchy
- Tier 1: Published books, academic papers, established texts
- Tier 2: University websites, mystery school publications
- Tier 3: FORBIDDEN (blogs, anonymous sources, social media)

#### Confidence Framework
- HIGH: Multiple published books + ancient records (NOT channeled-only)
- MEDIUM: Single channeled source OR thematic pattern
- LOW: Single modern source OR disputed claims
- SPECULATIVE: Blog-level sources (if absolutely necessary)

#### Weight Calibration
- Weight 5: Multiple sources + ancient + cross-cultural
- Weight 4: Channeled + ancient association
- Weight 3: Single channeled OR strong thematic
- Weight 2: Contemporary published books
- Weight 1: Speculative/minimal support
- Rule: DO NOT assign weight 5 to channeled-only sources

#### Dispute Integration
- Must integrate disputes into main text (not just note them)
- Format: ancient_support array with status: CREDIBLE|DISPUTED
- Must cite counter-sources (e.g., van Beek 1991)
- Must adjust confidence accordingly

#### Evidence Type Clarification
- "explicit (channeled)" to distinguish from empirical explicit
- Clear definitions for thematic, cross_cultural, inferred

**Impact:** 
- Prevents Lyra HIGH confidence issue (7/8 models flagged)
- Prevents Andromeda blog source issue (8/8 models flagged)
- Prevents Sirius/Dogon dispute issue (7/8 models flagged)
- Prevents weight misalignment (6/8 models flagged)

## Expected Results

### Before Updates (Gate 1 Results)

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Citation verification rate | 74% |
| Blog sources used | 2 |
| Quote attribution errors | 1 |
| Confidence misalignments | 2 |
| Weight misalignments | 1 |
| Time spent on corrections | 3-5 hours |
| Need for 8-model validation | YES |

### After Updates (Expected)

| Metric | Expected |
|--------|----------|
| Citation verification rate | 90%+ |
| Blog sources used | 0 |
| Quote attribution errors | 0 |
| Confidence misalignments | 0 |
| Weight misalignments | 0 |
| Time spent on corrections | 30 min |
| Need for 8-model validation | NO (spot-check only) |

## Validation Strategy Going Forward

### Old Approach (Expensive)
1. Research gate with templates
2. Validate with 8 expensive models
3. Spend 3-5 hours fixing issues
4. Re-validate
5. **Cost:** High, **Time:** 6-8 hours per gate

### New Approach (Efficient)
1. Research gate with bulletproof templates
2. Spot-check 2-3 citations with 1 model (GPT-5 or Gemini)
3. Fix minor issues (30 min)
4. Launch
5. Full validation every 10 gates as quality check
6. **Cost:** 90% reduction, **Time:** 2-3 hours per gate

## Breaking Changes

### JSON Structure Changes

**Pass A & B:**
- Added `"quote_type": "exact|paraphrase"` field to all citations

**Pass C:**
- Added `"quote_type": "exact|paraphrase"` field to all sources
- Added `"publisher"` field to all sources
- Added `"isbn"` field to all sources (optional)
- Added `"dispute_note"` field to disputed sources
- Changed `ancient_support` from string array to object array with status

### Old Format (Pass C ancient_support):
```json
"ancient_support": [
  "Egyptian mystery schools identified Sirius with Isis",
  "Dogon tribe preserved knowledge of Sirius B"
]
```

### New Format (Pass C ancient_support):
```json
"ancient_support": [
  {
    "claim": "Egyptian Sopdet/Isis association",
    "status": "CREDIBLE",
    "note": "Well-documented historical association"
  },
  {
    "claim": "Dogon Sirius B knowledge",
    "status": "DISPUTED",
    "dispute": "Van Beek (1991) fieldwork found no evidence",
    "note": "Temple's interpretation remains controversial"
  }
]
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Gate 1 Outputs

1. Add `"quote_type"` field to all citations
2. Restructure `ancient_support` to new object format
3. Add `"publisher"` field to Pass C sources
4. Fix known issues:
   - Marciniak book attribution
   - Hopi blog source
   - Royal/Priest paraphrase marking
   - Lyra confidence downgrade
   - Andromeda source upgrade
   - Sirius dispute integration
   - Weight recalibration

### For Future Gates

1. Use new templates (v2.0)
2. Follow hard rules strictly
3. Complete verification checklists
4. Spot-check with 1 model instead of 8
5. Full validation every 10 gates

---

## Confidence Level

**Will these templates prevent the issues found in Gate 1?**

‚úÖ **95% YES**

The remaining 5% risk:
- Paywalled sources you can't verify
- Rare edge cases in oral traditions
- Newly published books not yet online

But these are manageable with spot-checking, not full 8-model validation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Apply fixes to Gate 1 outputs using corrections guide
2. Test templates on Gate 2 with spot-check validation
3. Full validation on Gate 10 to verify template effectiveness
4. Iterate if needed (unlikely given unanimous consensus)

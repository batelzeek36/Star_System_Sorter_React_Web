🔒 HARD RULES (8-MODEL VALIDATION CONSENSUS - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
1. Blog sources (WordPress, Medium, personal websites, starseed blogs) - UNACCEPTABLE
2. Anonymous authors ("Various researchers", "Contemporary researchers") - UNACCEPTABLE
3. Fabricated quotes or page numbers - UNACCEPTABLE
4. Paraphrases presented as direct quotes - MUST mark as paraphrase
5. Wrong book attribution - VERIFY book title matches quote
6. HIGH confidence for channeled-only sources - UNACCEPTABLE
7. Highest weights on weakest evidence - UNACCEPTABLE

✅ SOURCE HIERARCHY (Use in order of preference):

TIER 1 - ACCEPTABLE PRIMARY SOURCES:
1. Published books with ISBN (channeled or research)
2. Academic papers and peer-reviewed journals
3. Established esoteric texts (Bailey, Blavatsky, Steiner)
4. Documented oral traditions via anthropologists

TIER 2 - ACCEPTABLE SECONDARY SOURCES:

TIER 3 - UNACCEPTABLE:
❌ Blogs and personal websites
❌ Anonymous "contemporary researchers"
❌ Social media posts
❌ Wiki-style sites without citations
❌ YouTube videos or podcasts
❌ Starseed community websites without published books

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🎯 CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HIGH Confidence (Use sparingly):
✅ Multiple published books explicitly state connection
✅ Ancient historical records document association
✅ Cross-cultural pattern with 3+ independent traditions
❌ NOT ALLOWED for channeled-only sources (even if "explicit")
❌ NOT ALLOWED for single-source claims

MEDIUM Confidence:
✅ Single established channeled source (Bailey, Marciniak, Royal)
✅ Thematic pattern across 2+ published sources
✅ Ancient association + modern esoteric support
✅ Channeled sources with cross-verification

LOW Confidence:
✅ Single modern published source only
✅ Thematic inference without explicit statement
✅ Contemporary spiritual community consensus (if from books)
✅ Disputed claims even if widely cited

SPECULATIVE:
✅ Blog-level sources (if absolutely necessary, downgrade to speculative)
✅ Single-source inference
✅ Intuitive connections without published support

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⚖️ WEIGHT CALIBRATION RULES (MANDATORY)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Assign weights based on EVIDENCE QUALITY, not thematic importance:

Weight 5: Multiple published sources + ancient records + cross-cultural
Weight 4: Established channeled source + ancient association
Weight 3: Single established channeled source OR strong thematic pattern
Weight 2: Contemporary interpretation with published book sources
Weight 1: Speculative connection with minimal support

RULES:
- Total weight across all systems should be ≤15 per gate
- DO NOT assign weight 5 to channeled-only sources, even if "explicit"
- DO NOT assign highest weight to weakest evidence
- Weights must align with confidence levels

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🚨 DISPUTE INTEGRATION REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If a source is disputed (e.g., Temple/Dogon, Collier/Andromeda):
1. State the claim
2. IMMEDIATELY note the dispute in the same section
3. Cite the counter-source (e.g., van Beek 1991)
4. Adjust confidence accordingly (usually to LOW)
5. Separate credible elements from disputed ones

Example format:
"ancient_support": [
  {
    "claim": "Egyptian Sopdet/Isis association",
    "status": "CREDIBLE",
    "note": "Well-documented historical association"
  },
  {
    "claim": "Dogon Sirius B knowledge",
    "status": "DISPUTED",
    "dispute": "Van Beek (1991) fieldwork found no evidence of pre-colonial Sirius B knowledge",
    "note": "Temple's interpretation remains controversial"
  }
]

🔍 DISCOVERY ENCOURAGED - FIND THE HIDDEN GEMS!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The MORE OBSCURE and verifiable, the BETTER! We want deep esoteric sources, not just the popular ones.

✨ ACTIVELY SEEK:
- Obscure Theosophical publications beyond Bailey (e.g., C.W. Leadbeater, Geoffrey Hodson)
- Lesser-known channeled works from established publishers (e.g., early 1900s spiritualist texts)
- Academic papers on star mythology from comparative religion journals
- Rare mystery school texts from university special collections
- Overlooked passages in canonical esoteric texts (e.g., obscure Bailey chapters, Blavatsky footnotes)
- Indigenous star lore documented by anthropologists (e.g., Polynesian, Aboriginal, Native American)
- Historical astronomical texts with mythological content (e.g., medieval Arabic star catalogs)
- Obscure Hermetic, Gnostic, or Kabbalistic texts with star references

🎯 EXAMPLES OF GREAT DISCOVERIES:
- "The Inner Life" by C.W. Leadbeater (1911), Theosophical Publishing, pp. 234-237
- "Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning" by Richard Hinckley Allen (1899), Dover, pp. 45-48
- "Aboriginal Astronomy" by Ray Norris & Cilla Norris (2009), academic paper with indigenous sources
- Obscure passage from Blavatsky's "The Secret Doctrine" Vol. 2, pp. 567-569
- "The Sirius Connection" by Murry Hope (1996), Element Books - lesser-known than Temple
- Indigenous Polynesian star navigation documented by David Lewis (1972)

⚠️ STILL MUST BE:
✅ Published book with ISBN (not blog or website)
✅ Named author (not "Various researchers")
✅ Specific page/chapter numbers
✅ Publisher information
✅ Verifiable via Comet browser
✅ Follows source hierarchy (Tier 1 or 2)

💡 SEARCH STRATEGY:
- Search beyond Bailey/Marciniak/Royal - find the lesser-known channelers
- Look for academic papers on star mythology (JSTOR, academia.edu)
- Check Theosophical Society archives and publications
- Search for indigenous star lore via anthropological sources
- Look for historical astronomical texts with mythological content
- Search university special collections for rare esoteric texts
- Check archive.org for out-of-print esoteric books
- Look beyond the "top 5" Google results

🌟 BONUS POINTS FOR:
- Finding connections NO ONE else has documented
- Discovering indigenous traditions that parallel the star system archetype
- Locating obscure Theosophical or Hermetic texts that explicitly mention the star system
- Uncovering academic papers that validate esoteric claims
- Finding historical astronomical texts that bridge science and mythology

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:
- Use Perplexity Sonar Deep Research with Comet browser enabled
- Verify all citations by accessing actual sources via web browsing
- Mark any citations you cannot directly verify as "not available" with explanation

Task: Using Gate 7's essence (leadership, direction, democracy, role of the self), map to candidate star systems:

STAR SYSTEMS:
- Sirius (teachers, guardians, Sirian-Christos lineage)
- Pleiades (nurturers, artists, empaths, Seven Sisters)
- Orion Light/Osirian (historians, Egyptian mystery schools, Thoth/Hermes)
- Arcturus (engineers, healers, geometric consciousness)
- Andromeda (explorers, iconoclasts, freedom, sovereignty)
- Lyra (primordial builders, feline beings, instinct)
- Draco (power, will, hierarchy, kundalini - disputed)
- Zeta Reticuli (analysts, experimenters, detachment)

QUOTE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (Complete before submitting):

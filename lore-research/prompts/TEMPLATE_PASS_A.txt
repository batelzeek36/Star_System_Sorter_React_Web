🎓 ACADEMIC CONTEXT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This research supports Star System Sorter, which maps Human Design's I Ching-based gate system to star mythology.

**Human Design's Academic Foundations:**
- **I Ching (64 hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement (Wilhelm translation, 1950)
- **64 DNA codons** - Nobel Prize research (Nirenberg & Khorana, 1968)
- **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Extensive academic study (Scholem, Idel)
- **Chakra system** - Religious Studies, Yoga Studies (Feuerstein)
- **Western Astrology** - Cultural/historical phenomenon (Tarnas)

**Mathematical Correspondences:**
- 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (verifiable fact)
- Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)

**Your Task:** Document gate characteristics using rigorous sourcing standards. This is **comparative mythology research**, not pseudoscience.

🔒 HARD RULES (8-MODEL VALIDATION CONSENSUS - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
1. Blog sources (WordPress, Medium, personal websites) - UNACCEPTABLE
2. Anonymous authors ("Various researchers", "Contemporary sources") - UNACCEPTABLE
3. Fabricated quotes or page numbers - UNACCEPTABLE
4. Paraphrases presented as direct quotes - MUST mark as paraphrase
5. Wrong book attribution - VERIFY book title matches quote

✅ MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Verify exact quote wording against source (or mark as paraphrase)
2. Provide specific page numbers WHEN ACCESSIBLE (see pragmatic guidelines below)
3. Include edition information for all sources
4. Use published books with ISBN, not summaries or reviews
5. Prioritize CONTENT QUALITY over citation perfection

📖 PRAGMATIC PAGE NUMBER GUIDELINES:

For Ra Uru Hu / Human Design sources:
✅ ACCEPTABLE: "Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}} Section" or "Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}}, Lines 1-6"
✅ ACCEPTABLE: "The Rave I'Ching, Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}}" (these books are organized by gate)
⚠️ WHY: HD books are indexed by gate number, not page numbers. Gate section IS the citation.

For Gene Keys:
✅ ACCEPTABLE: "Gene Key {{GATE_NUMBER}}: [Title]" or "The {{GATE_NUMBER}}st/nd/rd Gene Key"
✅ ACCEPTABLE: Quotes from genekeys.com official site (it's the author's official platform)
⚠️ WHY: Gene Keys book is organized by gene key number. The gene key number IS the citation.

For I Ching:
✅ REQUIRED: "Hexagram {{GATE_NUMBER}}, [Judgment/Image/Lines]" with translator name
✅ BEST: Wilhelm/Baynes translation (gold standard, widely available)
⚠️ WHY: I Ching is universally organized by hexagram number across all translations.

💡 FOCUS ON VALUE, NOT BUREAUCRACY:
- A great quote with "Gate 5 Section" is BETTER than no quote with perfect page numbers
- Official websites (humandesign.com, genekeys.com) are ACCEPTABLE for these specific systems
- Rich contextual notes are MORE VALUABLE than defensive explanations about missing page numbers

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:
- Use Perplexity Sonar Deep Research with Comet browser enabled
- Verify all citations by accessing actual sources via web browsing
- Mark any citations you cannot directly verify as "not available" with explanation

QUOTE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (Complete before submitting):
□ Exact wording matches source (or marked as paraphrase)
□ Correct book title and edition
□ Accurate page number (not "throughout text" or vague section)
□ Author name spelled correctly
□ Publication year correct
□ URL leads to actual source (not summary/review)

Requirements:
- Pull Ra Uru Hu's meaning (1–2 sentences) with exact page or section and book/edition metadata
- Pull Gene Keys (shadow, gift, siddhi) with exact page or section
- I Ching Hexagram {{GATE_NUMBER}}: canonical name + brief meaning + why it maps to Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}}
- All arrays must be present (can contain "not available" only if truly unavailable)

📤 OUTPUT FORMAT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Return **JSON only** (no markdown, no pre/post text). Output **minified JSON**.

💎 NOTES FIELD - MAKE IT VALUABLE:

The "notes" field should provide RICH CONTEXT, not excuses. Include:
- Which center/circuit this gate belongs to
- Channel connections (e.g., "Gate 1 connects to Gate 8 via Channel of Inspiration")
- Circuit type (Individual/Tribal/Collective)
- Key concepts from Ra's Line Companion or other HD sources
- Gene Keys frequency spectrum details (shadow → gift → siddhi progression)
- I Ching trigram composition and symbolism
- Cross-references to related gates or themes

❌ BAD NOTES: "Page numbers not available despite extensive search..."
✅ GOOD NOTES: "Gate 1 (G-Center/Identity) connects to Gate 8 via Channel of Inspiration (Individual Circuit). Ra's Line Companion: 'Creation is independent of will' and 'Time is everything' for mutation. Gene Keys frequency: Entropy (chaos) → Freshness (vitality) → Beauty (union). I Ching: Two Heaven trigrams (☰☰) representing pure yang creative energy."

QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:
- ✅ Do all citations have gate/hexagram/gene key numbers (the primary organizational unit)?
- ✅ Do all citations have actual quotes (prioritize content over perfect formatting)?
- ✅ Are paraphrases clearly marked with "quote_type": "paraphrase"?
- ✅ Do all citations have edition information?
- ✅ Are URLs included where available?
- ✅ Does "notes" field provide RICH CONTEXT (centers, channels, circuits, frequency spectrum)?
- ✅ Have you searched for sources that CONTRADICT this gate meaning?
- ✅ If contradictions found, are they noted in "notes" or "contradictions" field?
- ❌ Are there ANY blog sources? (If yes, REMOVE them - official author sites are OK)
- ❌ Are there ANY anonymous authors? (If yes, find actual author or remove)
- ❌ Is "notes" field just explaining missing page numbers? (If yes, ADD ACTUAL CONTEXT instead)

VALIDATION LESSONS LEARNED:
- Ra Uru Hu quotes are often condensed summaries - mark as paraphrase if not exact
- Gene Keys quotes are poetic - verify exact wording or mark as paraphrase
- I Ching Wilhelm/Baynes is gold standard - always verifiable
- "Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}} Section" IS a valid citation for HD books (they're organized by gate)
- "Gene Key {{GATE_NUMBER}}" IS a valid citation for Gene Keys (organized by key number)
- Focus on RICH CONTEXTUAL NOTES (centers, channels, circuits) not defensive explanations
- Official author websites (humandesign.com, genekeys.com) are acceptable sources

Return **JSON only** (no markdown, no pre/post text). Output **minified JSON**.

EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:
- Use Perplexity Sonar Deep Research with Comet browser enabled
- Verify all citations by accessing actual sources via web browsing
- Mark any citations you cannot directly verify as "not available" with explanation

Task: Using Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}}'s essence ({{GATE_ARCHETYPE}}), map to candidate star systems:

STAR SYSTEMS:
- Sirius (teachers, guardians, Sirian-Christos lineage)
- Pleiades (nurturers, artists, empaths, Seven Sisters)
- Orion Light/Osirian (historians, Egyptian mystery schools, Thoth/Hermes)
- Arcturus (engineers, healers, geometric consciousness)
- Andromeda (explorers, iconoclasts, freedom, sovereignty)
- Lyra (primordial builders, feline beings, instinct)
- Draco (power, will, hierarchy, kundalini - disputed)
- Zeta Reticuli (analysts, experimenters, detachment)

CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- You MUST find exact page numbers, chapters, or specific sections for EVERY source
- You MUST extract actual quotes ≤25 words from the source material
- You MUST include edition/publication information (e.g., "1st Edition 1998", "Revised 2015")
- You MUST include working URLs when available
- If a citation element is unavailable despite thorough search with Comet:
  * Mark the field as "not available"
  * Add explanation in "notes" (e.g., "Source is paywalled", "Channeled material without page numbers")
  * Continue with available information rather than fabricating
- DO NOT dump URLs outside the JSON structure - parse them into the sources array with full metadata
- DO NOT fabricate citations - honest "not available" is better than fake precision
- Each alignment needs 2-3 sources with FULL metadata (not just URLs)
- Each alignment should include at least 1 "ancient" or "scholarly" tier source when available

Rules:
- 3–5 alignments max
- Mark confidence: high|medium|low|speculative
- Tag evidence_type per alignment: explicit|thematic|cross_cultural|inferred
- Include 2–3 sources per alignment (mix ancient + modern esoteric when possible)
- For Orion, specify "Orion Light" or "Osirian" (not just "Orion")
- All arrays must be present (can be empty [])

SOURCE TIER DEFINITIONS:
- ancient: Texts 1000+ years old (Egyptian, Vedic, I Ching, etc.)
- scholarly: Academic research, peer-reviewed studies
- historical: Mystery school texts, indigenous traditions (100-1000 years)
- channeled: Modern channeled material (post-1900)
- modern: Contemporary esoteric synthesis, blog posts, recent interpretations

WEIGHTS_HINT RULES:
- Total weight across all systems should be ≤15 per gate
- Higher weight = stronger alignment (1=weak, 5=very strong)
- Must match the alignments you identified above
- Reason should be 5-10 words max

QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:
- ✅ Does each alignment have 2-3 sources with full metadata?
- ✅ Do all sources have specific page numbers or sections (or "not available" with explanation)?
- ✅ Do all sources have actual quotes (or "not available" with explanation)?
- ✅ Do all sources have edition information?
- ✅ Are URLs included where available?
- ✅ Does each alignment include at least 1 "ancient" or "scholarly" tier source (when available)?
- ✅ Is each source properly tagged with source_tier?
- ✅ Have you searched for sources that CONTRADICT this star system alignment?
- ✅ If contradictions found, are they listed in the "contradictions" array?
- ⚠️ If critical information is "not available", have you explained why in "notes"?

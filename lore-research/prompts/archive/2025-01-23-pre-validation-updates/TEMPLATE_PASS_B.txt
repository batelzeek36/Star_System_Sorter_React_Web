Return **JSON only** (no markdown, no pre/post text). Output **minified JSON**.

EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:
- Use Perplexity Sonar Deep Research with Comet browser enabled
- Verify all citations by accessing actual sources via web browsing
- Mark any citations you cannot directly verify as "not available" with explanation

Task: For Human Design Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}} archetype ({{GATE_ARCHETYPE}}), find **best-fit** ancient parallels (max 6 items total) from:
- Egyptian/Thothian (Emerald Tablets, Book of the Dead, Pyramid Texts, Hermetica)
- Chinese/Taoist (I Ching #{{GATE_NUMBER}} is mandatory; Tao Te Ching if relevant)
- Vedic/Hindu (Rig Veda, Gita, Upanishads)
- Indigenous (Hopi, Dogon, Aboriginal Seven Sisters, Cherokee/Mayan star lore)
- Greek/Mystery Schools (Orphic, Plato, Pythagoras)
- Sumerian/Mesopotamian (Enuma Elish, Gilgamesh, Sumerian King List)

CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- You MUST find exact page numbers, verse numbers, or specific sections (e.g., "Verse 1.1-1.5", "Tablet III, lines 20-25")
- You MUST extract actual quotes ≤25 words from the source material
- You MUST include edition/translation information (e.g., "Wilhelm/Baynes translation", "Penguin Classics 1987")
- You MUST include working URLs when available
- If a citation element is unavailable despite thorough search with Comet:
  * Mark the field as "not available"
  * Add explanation in "notes" (e.g., "Translation lacks verse numbers", "Oral tradition source")
  * Continue with available information rather than fabricating
- DO NOT dump URLs outside the JSON structure - parse them into the citations array with full metadata
- DO NOT fabricate citations - honest "not available" is better than fake precision

Rules:
- Prefer **one solid citation per tradition** over many weak ones
- If no clean match in a tradition, omit it (don't force it)
- All arrays must be present (can be empty [])

QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:
- ✅ Do all connections have specific page/verse/section numbers (or "not available" with explanation)?
- ✅ Do all connections have actual quotes (or "not available" with explanation)?
- ✅ Do all connections have edition/translation information?
- ✅ Are URLs included where available?
- ✅ Have you searched for ancient sources that CONTRADICT this archetype interpretation?
- ✅ If contradictions found, are they listed in the "contradictions" array?
- ✅ For indigenous sources, have you verified they are from public domain or authorized publications?
- ⚠️ If critical information is "not available", have you explained why in "notes"?

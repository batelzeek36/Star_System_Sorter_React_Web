Research "Human Design Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}}".

EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:
- Use Perplexity Sonar Deep Research with Comet browser enabled
- Verify all citations by accessing actual sources via web browsing
- Mark any citations you cannot directly verify as "not available" with explanation

CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- You MUST find exact page numbers or specific sections (e.g., "Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}}, Lines 1-6", "Chapter 3, pp. 45-47")
- You MUST extract actual quotes ≤25 words from the source material
- You MUST include edition information (e.g., "2nd Edition", "Revised Edition", "1st Edition")
- You MUST include working URLs when available
- If a citation element is unavailable despite thorough search with Comet:
  * Mark the field as "not available"
  * Add explanation in "notes" (e.g., "Source is paywalled", "Oral tradition without written record")
  * Continue with available information rather than fabricating
- DO NOT dump URLs outside the JSON structure - parse them into the citations array with full metadata
- DO NOT fabricate citations - honest "not available" is better than fake precision

Requirements:
- Pull Ra Uru Hu's meaning (1–2 sentences) with exact page or section and book/edition metadata
- Pull Gene Keys (shadow, gift, siddhi) with exact page or section
- I Ching Hexagram {{GATE_NUMBER}}: canonical name + brief meaning + why it maps to Gate {{GATE_NUMBER}}
- All arrays must be present (can contain "unknown" only if truly unavailable)

QUALITY CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:
- ✅ Do all citations have specific page numbers or sections (or "not available" with explanation)?
- ✅ Do all citations have actual quotes (or "not available" with explanation)?
- ✅ Do all citations have edition information?
- ✅ Are URLs included where available?
- ✅ Have you searched for sources that CONTRADICT this gate meaning?
- ✅ If contradictions found, are they noted in "notes" or "contradictions" field?
- ⚠️ If critical information is "not available", have you explained why in "notes"?

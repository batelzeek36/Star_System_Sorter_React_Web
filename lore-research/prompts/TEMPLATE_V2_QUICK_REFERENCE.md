## üéØ Confidence Framework (Quick)

| Confidence | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Multiple published books + ancient records | Sirius/Egypt (historical + esoteric) |
| **MEDIUM** | Single channeled source OR thematic pattern | Pleiades (Marciniak established) |
| **LOW** | Single modern source OR disputed claims | Andromeda (limited sources) |
| **SPECULATIVE** | Blog-level or minimal support | Avoid if possible |

**Rule:** Channeled-only sources = MEDIUM max (never HIGH)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Weight Calibration (Quick)

| Weight | Evidence Quality | Example |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **5** | Multiple sources + ancient + cross-cultural | Reserved for strongest |
| **4** | Channeled + ancient association | Sirius (Bailey + Egypt) |
| **3** | Single channeled OR strong thematic | Pleiades (Marciniak) |
| **2** | Contemporary published books | Andromeda (if upgraded) |
| **1** | Speculative/minimal | Avoid if possible |

**Rule:** Total ‚â§15 per gate, strongest evidence = highest weight

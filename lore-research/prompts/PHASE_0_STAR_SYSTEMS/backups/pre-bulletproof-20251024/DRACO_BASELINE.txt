## OBJECTIVE
Research DRACO and dragon archetype across cultures. CRITICAL: Separate ancient dragon symbolism from modern conspiracy theories.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Power, control, dominance
- Hierarchy and royalty
- Reptilian/dragon archetype
- Genetic manipulators (disputed)
- Often misunderstood or polarized as evil (but not inherently so)

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md` - 300+ verified sources.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

### Ancient Dragon Mythology (HIGH ancient support)
- Chinese: Dragons as wisdom, imperial power, yang energy
- European: Dragons as guardians of treasure, chaos
- Mayan: Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl (feathered serpent)
- Norse: Níðhöggr, Fáfnir
- Babylonian: Tiamat (primordial chaos dragon)
- Hindu/Buddhist: Naga serpents (wisdom, power)

### Astronomical
- Thuban (Alpha Draconis) - former pole star (3000 BCE)
- Draco constellation mythology

### Modern Esoteric (CONTROVERSIAL)
- "The Biggest Secret" by David Icke (1999) - MARK AS DISPUTED
- "Blue Blood, True Blood" by Stewart Swerdlow
- Various channeled material on Draco entities

## CRITICAL: Disputed Claims Handling

**David Icke's "reptilian" conspiracy theories are highly controversial.** You MUST:
1. Include them (they're part of the discourse)
2. Mark as `disputed: true`
3. Include counter-evidence or skeptical sources
4. Note: `source_type: "controversial"`

## SPECIAL FOCUS: Shadow vs Light Draco

Document any sources that distinguish:
- Shadow Draco (control, manipulation, negative)
- Light Draco (power, sovereignty, positive)
- Eastern vs Western dragon duality (wisdom vs evil)

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT conflate Draco with kundalini - that's a common stretch in the lore community without solid evidence.

## OBJECTIVE
Research ORION DARK faction characteristics. CRITICAL: Distinguish from Orion Light/Osirian AND from Draco (though often allied).

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Control and hierarchy (shadow expression)
- Power structures and domination
- Genetic manipulation programs
- Often allied with Draco but distinct
- Shadow work and integration themes
- Not inherently "evil" but shadow-coded

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md` - 300+ verified sources.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

### Channeled Material
- "The Law of One" (Ra Material) - Orion "negative polarity" entities
- Lyssa Royal Holt works - Orion Empire references
- Bashar (Darryl Anka) - Orion Dark vs Light distinction
- Alex Collier - Orion Empire mentions

### Esoteric Literature
- References to "Orion Empire" or "Orion Confederation"
- Shadow work teachings that reference Orion
- Galactic history channeled material

### Ancient Sources
- Limited direct references (Orion = Osiris in Egyptian, which is Light faction)
- Look for shadow/duality themes in Orion mythology

## CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS

### Orion Dark vs Orion Light
Document how sources distinguish:
- **Orion Light**: Wisdom, mystery schools, Thoth/Hermes, sacred geometry
- **Orion Dark**: Control, hierarchy, domination, shadow expression

### Orion Dark vs Draco
Document how sources distinguish:
- **Orion Dark**: Orion star system, control-oriented faction
- **Draco**: Separate star system (Draco constellation), often allied but distinct
- **Alliance**: Many sources mention Orion Dark-Draco alliance

## SPECIAL HANDLING: Shadow vs Evil

**Orion Dark is not "evil"** - it represents:
- Shadow work and integration
- Power and control archetypes
- Service-to-self polarity (Law of One terminology)
- Necessary counterbalance to Light

Mark sources that:
- Polarize Orion Dark as purely negative: `polarized: true`
- Present nuanced view of shadow work: `nuanced: true`
- Discuss redemption/integration themes: `integration_themes: true`

## CITATION REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every source MUST include full metadata, translator/editor if applicable, specific location, actual quotes (NOT PLACEHOLDERS), URLs, and source type.

⚠️ **EXAMPLES ARE EXAMPLES ONLY - FIND ACTUAL SOURCES**

## QUALITY CHECKLIST
✅ 5+ sources per characteristic (minimum 3 if truly limited)
✅ Orion Dark vs Orion Light clearly distinguished
✅ Orion Dark vs Draco clearly distinguished
✅ Alliance with Draco documented
✅ Shadow work themes noted (not just "evil")
✅ Law of One "negative polarity" references
✅ Full citations with page/session numbers (no placeholders)
✅ Edition information and URLs included

## EXPECTED FINDINGS
- Control/hierarchy: MEDIUM-HIGH consensus (channeled sources)
- Ancient support: LOW/UNKNOWN (modern concept)
- Draco alliance: MEDIUM consensus
- Shadow work themes: MEDIUM consensus (nuanced sources)
- Polarized as "evil": Note but don't emphasize

**If unverifiable claims exist**, note in `research_notes`.

**Minimum acceptable: 3-5 characteristics, 5+ sources each (minimum 3 if truly limited), Light/Dark/Draco distinctions clear, shadow work nuance included.**

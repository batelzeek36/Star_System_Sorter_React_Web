## OBJECTIVE
Research ARCTURUS characteristics in esoteric literature and channeling. Note: Ancient support expected to be LOW/UNKNOWN.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Energy healers
- Frequency-based consciousness
- Architects of advanced tech + sacred geometry
- Defenders of Earth's energy grids
- Dreamtime and sleep-state engineers

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md` - 300+ verified sources.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

### Modern Channeled Material
- Edgar Cayce readings (indexed - search "Arcturus")
- "We, the Arcturians" by Norma Milanovich (1990)
- "The Arcturian Anthology" by Tom Kenyon (1996)
- Bashar (Darryl Anka) mentions
- Dolores Cannon starseed material

### Ancient Sources
- Limited to none expected
- Check Greek mythology (Arcturus = "Bear Guard")
- Astronomical references only (brightest in Boötes)

## SPECIAL NOTE: Modern-Only Phenomenon

Arcturus appears almost exclusively in modern channeled material (post-1950s). This is VALID but must be labeled:
- `ancient_support: "low"` or `"unknown"`
- `source_type: "channeled"` for most sources
- Note the lack of ancient references explicitly

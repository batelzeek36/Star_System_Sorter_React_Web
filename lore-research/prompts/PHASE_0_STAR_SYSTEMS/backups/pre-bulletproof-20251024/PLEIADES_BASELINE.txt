## OBJECTIVE
Research and document characteristics attributed to the PLEIADES star cluster across ancient mythology, indigenous traditions, modern esoteric literature, and channeled material. Return findings as minified JSON with complete citations.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Emotional empaths and healers
- Artistic, sensual, aesthetic beings
- Feminine-coded (Yin, Venusian energy)
- Starseed origin point for many souls
- Spiritual midwives of awakening

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md`

This library contains 300+ verified sources. Use these as examples of source quality. Find sources AS GOOD AS or BETTER THAN these.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

- Cherokee: Seven boys who became stars
- Maya: Tzab (rattlesnake's tail)
- Hindu: Krittika (nurturing mothers of Kartikeya)

## CITATION REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every source MUST include:
1. **Full title** (exact, not abbreviated)
2. **Author name(s)** (full names, not initials)
3. **Translator/Editor** (for ancient texts - e.g., "Theony Condos (translator)")
4. **Edition information** (e.g., "Revised Edition", "2nd Edition")
5. **Publication year** (original and edition if different)
6. **Specific location** (page numbers, chapter, section, verse/line for ancient texts)
7. **Direct quote** (≤25 words, actual text from source - NOT PLACEHOLDER)
8. **URL** (if available online - archive.org, publisher, academic database)
9. **Source type** (ancient|research|channeled|indigenous|controversial)

## SPECIAL FOCUS: Cross-Cultural Validation

The Seven Sisters pattern appears in 6+ cultures globally. Document:
- Which cultures have Seven Sisters myths?
- What characteristics are attributed to them?
- Are there consensus patterns (nurturing, feminine, artistic)?
- How do ancient myths compare to modern channeled material?

## CONSENSUS LEVELS
- **HIGH**: 3+ independent sources, cross-cultural validation
- **MEDIUM**: 2-3 sources, or strong in one category
- **LOW**: Single source, disputed, or channeled-only

## ANCIENT SUPPORT LEVELS
- **HIGH**: Explicit in ancient texts/myths (Seven Sisters ubiquity)
- **MEDIUM**: Inferred from deity associations
- **LOW**: Symbolic resonance only
- **UNKNOWN**: No ancient references

> "Note: No credible evidence found for [claim], despite prevalence in New Age discourse."

**Minimum acceptable: 3-5 characteristics, each with 5+ fully cited sources (minimum 3 if truly limited), cross-cultural validation noted.**

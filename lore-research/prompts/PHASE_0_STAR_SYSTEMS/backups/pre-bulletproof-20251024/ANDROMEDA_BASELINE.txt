## OBJECTIVE
Research ANDROMEDAN characteristics in mythology and channeling. Note: Ancient support expected to be LOW (symbolic only).

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Sovereignty / anti-control ethos
- Galactic explorers, nomadic
- Non-hierarchical culture
- Technically advanced yet tribal
- Often anti-interventionist

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md` - 300+ verified sources.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

### Ancient Mythology
- Greek: Princess Andromeda (chained, freed by Perseus)
- Astronomical: Andromeda Galaxy (M31)
- Note: Greek myth is SYMBOLIC resonance only, not ET claim

### Modern Contactee/Channeled Material
- "Defending Sacred Ground" by Alex Collier (1996)
- Lyssa Royal Holt works
- Andromedan Council channeled material
- Bashar (Darryl Anka) contrasts/mentions

## SPECIAL NOTE: Symbolic vs Direct Evidence

Greek mythology provides SYMBOLIC resonance (freedom from chains = sovereignty theme) but is NOT direct evidence of ET contact. Mark as:
- `evidence_type: "symbolic"`
- `ancient_support: "low"`

Modern contactee material is direct but unverified:
- `source_type: "channeled"` or `"contactee"`
- `consensus_level: "medium"` (consistent across sources but modern-only)

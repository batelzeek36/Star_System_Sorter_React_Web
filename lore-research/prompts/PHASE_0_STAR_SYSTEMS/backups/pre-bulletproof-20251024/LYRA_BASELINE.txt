## OBJECTIVE
Research LYRA as primordial root race in esoteric and channeled texts. Note: Ancient support expected to be LOW/UNKNOWN.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Primordial humanoid root race
- Feline (or avian) ancestry
- Builders of early civilizations
- Refugees after war with Draco
- Carry "first template" consciousness

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md` - 300+ verified sources.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

### Modern Channeled Material
- "The Prism of Lyra" by Lyssa Royal Holt (1989)
- "The Three Waves of Volunteers" by Dolores Cannon (2011)
- Bashar (Darryl Anka) mentions
- Starseed literature (various authors)

### Theosophical/Root Race Theory
- Helena Blavatsky "The Secret Doctrine" (1888)
- Root race theories (Lemurian connections)

### Ancient Sources
- Limited to none expected
- Greek: Lyra constellation (Orpheus's lyre)
- Note: Mythological lyre ≠ ET claims

## SPECIAL FOCUS: Feline vs Avian Confusion

Sources disagree on Lyran form:
- Some say feline beings
- Others say avian or humanoid
- Document both, note inconsistency

## QUALITY CHECKLIST
✅ 5+ sources per characteristic (minimum 3 if truly limited)
✅ Feline vs avian inconsistency documented
✅ Ancient support explicitly noted as LOW/UNKNOWN

⚠️ **YOU MUST FIND AND VERIFY ACTUAL SOURCES WITH REAL QUOTES**

**If a commonly believed claim cannot be verified** (e.g., "Lyran feline DNA"), include it in `research_notes` with:
> "Note: No credible evidence found for [claim], despite prevalence in New Age discourse."

**Minimum acceptable: 3-5 characteristics, 5+ sources each (minimum 3 if truly limited), form inconsistencies noted.**

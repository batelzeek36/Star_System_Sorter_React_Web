## OBJECTIVE
Research ZETA RETICULI entities from UFO lore, channeling, and regression material. Note: Ancient support = NONE (modern phenomenon only).

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Emotionally detached intelligence
- Genetic researchers / experimenters
- Interdimensional abductors (neutral to negative)
- Timeline engineers
- Carry karmic debt from past implosions

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md` - 300+ verified sources.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

### Astronomical Facts (SOLID)
- Zeta Reticuli binary star system (~39 light-years from Earth)
- Not visible to naked eye (requires telescope)
- Therefore: NO ancient references possible

### UFO Lore (DISPUTED)
- Betty and Barney Hill case (1961) - star map
- Marjorie Fish analysis (1969) - attempted star map match
- Counter-evidence: Hipparcos satellite data (1990s) undercuts Fish's match
- Mark Hill star map as `disputed: true`

### Modern Channeled Material
- Bashar (Darryl Anka) - Zeta-human hybrid perspective
- "The Prism of Lyra" by Lyssa Royal (Zeta hybrid programs)
- Dolores Cannon regression sessions

### UFO Research
- "The Threat" by David Jacobs (1998)
- "Communion" by Whitley Strieber (1987)
- Abduction literature (various authors)

## CRITICAL: Hill Star Map Dispute

**Betty Hill's star map is academically disputed:**
- Supporting: Marjorie Fish's 1969 analysis
- Counter: Later Hipparcos data shows Fish's match was incorrect
- Mark as `disputed: true` with counter-evidence

## SPECIAL FOCUS: Evolution of Zeta Narrative

Document if sources show:
- Original Zeta (emotionally detached, abductors)
- Hybrid programs (Essassani, more benevolent)
- Karmic redemption themes
- Timeline engineering claims

## CITATION REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every source MUST include full metadata, translator/editor if applicable, specific location, actual quotes (NOT PLACEHOLDERS), URLs, and source type.

⚠️ **EXAMPLES ARE EXAMPLES ONLY - FIND ACTUAL SOURCES**

## QUALITY CHECKLIST
✅ 5+ sources per characteristic (minimum 3 if truly limited)
✅ Hill star map marked as disputed with counter-evidence
✅ Ancient support explicitly noted as NONE
✅ Astronomical facts separated from ET claims
✅ Hybrid program evolution documented
✅ Full citations with page numbers (no placeholders)
✅ Edition information and URLs included

**If unverifiable claims exist**, note in `research_notes`.

**Minimum acceptable: 3-5 characteristics, 5+ sources each (minimum 3 if truly limited), Hill map dispute noted, ancient support = none.**

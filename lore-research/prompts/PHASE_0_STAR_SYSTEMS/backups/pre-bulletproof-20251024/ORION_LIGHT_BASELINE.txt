## OBJECTIVE
Research ORION LIGHT/OSIRIAN characteristics (mystery schools, Thoth/Hermes lineage). EXCLUDE Orion Dark/Draco material.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Record keepers / historians
- Spiritual strategists / system architects
- Carriers of sacred geometry
- Affiliated with Thoth / Hermes / Osiris
- Oppose Orion "Dark" / Draco factions

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md`

This library contains 300+ verified sources. Use these as examples of source quality.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

### Ancient Egyptian
- Pyramid Texts (Orion = Sah = Osiris)
- Book of the Dead
- Coffin Texts
- Temple inscriptions (Dendera, Edfu)

### Hermetic Tradition
- Emerald Tablets (attributed to Thoth)
- Hermetic Corpus
- Rosicrucian writings

### Modern Research
- "The Orion Mystery" by Robert Bauval (1994)
- "The Sirius Mystery" by Robert Temple (Orion references)
- "The Law of One" (Ra Material - Orion mentions)

### Scholarly Works
- "The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts" by James P. Allen (2005)
- "The Orion Zone" by Gary A. David (2006)

## SPECIAL HANDLING: Light vs Dark Orion

Document any sources that distinguish:
- Osirian/Light Orion (mystery schools, wisdom)
- Draco-influenced/Dark Orion (control, hierarchy)

Mark as `faction: "light"` or `faction: "dark"` in sources.

## DISPUTED CLAIMS

**Orion Correlation Theory** (Bauval): Giza pyramids align with Orion's Belt
- Supporting: Bauval, Hancock
- Counter: Mainstream Egyptology (culturally interesting, not universally accepted)
- Mark as `disputed: true` with `consensus: "medium"`

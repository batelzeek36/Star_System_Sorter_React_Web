# Quick Start: V3 Baseline Prompts

## What Just Happened

✅ **Backed up all v2 prompts** to `v2-backup/` folder  
✅ **Created Sirius V3 prompt** with relaxed requirements  
✅ **Created manual verification guide** for your later work  
✅ **Maintained bulletproof standards** (NO Wikipedia, NO blogs, NO anonymous sources)

## What's Different in V3

**V2 Problem:** Comet gave up because it couldn't access full book texts  
**V3 Solution:** Comet can mark sources as "partial access" and you verify later

### V3 Allows:

- Chapter/section references when exact pages unavailable
- Best-effort quotes from previews (marked as such)
- `verification_status: partial_access` flag
- `manual_verification_needed: true` flag

### V3 Still Forbids:

- ❌ Wikipedia or encyclopedias
- ❌ Blogs or personal websites
- ❌ Anonymous authors
- ❌ Social media or YouTube
- ❌ Fabricated quotes or page numbers

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Sirius V3

Run `SIRIUS_BASELINE_V3.txt` with Comet and verify it produces results similar to v1.

### 2. If Successful, Update Other Star Systems

Apply the same V3 changes to:

- `LYRA_BASELINE.txt`
- `ANDROMEDA_BASELINE.txt`
- `ORION_LIGHT_BASELINE.txt`
- `ORION_DARK_BASELINE.txt`
- `ARCTURUS_BASELINE.txt`
- `DRACO_BASELINE.txt`

### 3. Run All Baselines

Get Comet to complete all 9 star system baselines.

### 4. Manual Verification (Later)

Follow `MANUAL_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md` to:

- Obtain the books Comet identified
- Verify exact page numbers
- Extract verbatim quotes
- Update JSON files with verified citations

## Files You Need

### For Running Prompts:

- `SIRIUS_BASELINE_V3.txt` - Ready to use
- Other `*_BASELINE.txt` files - Need V3 updates (tell me when ready)

### For Understanding:

- `V3_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed explanation of changes
- `MANUAL_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md` - How to verify citations later
- `_BULLETPROOF_TEMPLATE.txt` - Core standards (unchanged)

### For Reference:

- `v2-backup/` - Original v2 prompts (backup only)

## Expected Timeline

**Phase 1: Comet Research (Now)**

- Run V3 prompts: 5-10 minutes per star system
- Get source identification with ISBNs and best-effort citations
- Total: 1-2 hours for all 9 star systems

**Phase 2: Manual Verification (Later)**

- Obtain books: 2-4 hours per star system
- Verify citations: 3-6 hours per star system
- Total: 45-90 hours for all 9 star systems

**This is normal for academic-grade research.** V3 lets Comet do the fast part (source discovery), you do the slow part (verification).

## Quality Assurance

V3 maintains the same quality standards as v2, just allows honest marking of partial access instead of giving up.

**Result:** You get complete baseline research with proper source identification, then verify/enhance later.

## Ready to Proceed?

Tell me when you want to:

1. Test Sirius V3 with Comet
2. Update the other star system prompts to V3
3. Run all baselines

I'm ready to help with the next step!

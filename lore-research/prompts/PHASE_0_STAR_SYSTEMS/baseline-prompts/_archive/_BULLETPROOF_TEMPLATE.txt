### SOURCE QUALITY VERIFICATION RULES (MANDATORY)

**Every source MUST pass these checks before inclusion:**

✅ **ACCEPTABLE:**
- Published book with verifiable ISBN
- Academic journal with DOI or JSTOR link
- Ancient text with named translator/editor
- University/museum website with citations
- Established channeled work (published book, not blog)

❌ **UNACCEPTABLE (will cause REJECTION):**
- Blog posts or personal websites
- "Unknown" or missing page numbers
- Placeholder quotes like "[EXAMPLE QUOTE]" or "Discusses X"
- Paraphrases presented as direct quotes
- Anonymous authors or "Various researchers"
- Social media posts
- YouTube videos without published transcripts
- Wiki-style sites without citations

**Verification Process:**
1. Can you find this book on Amazon, publisher site, or library catalog? → YES = proceed
2. Does the page number/location exist in the actual source? → YES = proceed
3. Is the quote verbatim from the source (≤25 words)? → YES = proceed
4. Is the author's full name provided? → YES = proceed
5. Is the edition specified? → YES = proceed

**If ANY answer is NO → DO NOT include this source. Find a better one.**

## SOURCE QUALITY ENFORCEMENT

**Before submitting, verify EVERY source passes these checks:**

| Check | Requirement | Failure = Rejection |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Title** | Full, exact title (not abbreviated) | ❌ Abbreviated → ✅ Full title |
| **Author** | Full name (not initials) | ❌ Initials → ✅ Full name |
| **Edition** | Specific edition info | ❌ "unknown" → ✅ "First Edition" or year |
| **Page** | Exact location | ❌ "unknown" → ✅ Specific page/section |
| **Quote** | Verbatim text ≤25 words | ❌ "[EXAMPLE]" → ✅ Actual quote |
| **URL** | Working link if available | ❌ Missing when online → ✅ Include URL |
| **Translator** | Required for ancient texts | ❌ Missing → ✅ "Name (translator)" |
| **Verified** | Must be `true` | ❌ Missing field → ✅ `"verified": true` |

**Red Flags (indicate lazy research):**
- ❌ More than 20% of sources missing URLs when available online
- ❌ Any placeholder quotes or "unknown" fields
- ❌ Vague page references like "throughout" or "various pages"
- ❌ Missing translator/editor for ancient texts
- ❌ Abbreviated titles or author names

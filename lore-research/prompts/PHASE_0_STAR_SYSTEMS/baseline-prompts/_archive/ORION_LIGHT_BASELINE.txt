⚠️ **WIKIPEDIA & ONLINE ENCYCLOPEDIAS:**
Wikipedia, Encyclopedia.com, Britannica.com, and ALL online encyclopedia/aggregator sites are **COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN** - not as primary sources, not as secondary sources, not at all. These are lazy shortcuts. Instead:
- Find the PRIMARY SOURCE that the encyclopedia cites (the actual book, journal, or ancient text)
- Cite that source directly with full bibliographic information
- Example: Don't cite "Encyclopedia.com article on Egyptian Mystery Schools" → Cite Plutarch's "Isis and Osiris" or Iamblichus' "On the Mysteries"
- Example: Don't cite "Wikipedia article on Sopdet" → Cite the actual Pyramid Texts translation by Faulkner
- If an encyclopedia mentions a scholar's work, find and cite that scholar's published book or paper

**FORBIDDEN ENCYCLOPEDIA SITES (NEVER USE):**
❌ Wikipedia.org
❌ Encyclopedia.com
❌ Britannica.com / Encyclopaedia Britannica
❌ Ancient.eu / WorldHistory.org
❌ Mythopedia.com
❌ Any site with "encyclopedia", "wiki", or "pedia" in the domain

**FORBIDDEN BLOG/PERSONAL SITES (NEVER USE):**

❌ Tripod sites (*.tripod.com)
❌ Personal domains (crystalinks, preterhuman.net, etc.)

✅ Archive.org - Full book scans with page numbers
✅ Sacred-texts.com - Proper ancient text translations
✅ Publisher websites - Book excerpts with ISBNs
✅ Academic databases - JSTOR, academia.edu, university repositories
✅ Google Books - Preview pages with actual page numbers

This is a **lore-grade research project**, not a homework assignment. Use authoritative primary sources only.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔥 NO EXCUSES - YOU CAN DO THIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DO NOT give up and return empty results.** The Sirius and Pleiades baseline research successfully found:
- ISBNs for published books
- Specific page numbers and chapters
- Verbatim quotes from sources

**YOU MUST DO THE SAME FOR ORION LIGHT.**

**Where to find sources:**
✅ Archive.org - Full book scans with page numbers
✅ Google Books - Preview pages with quotes
✅ Publisher websites - Book excerpts and ISBNs
✅ Academic databases - JSTOR, academia.edu, university repositories
✅ Sacred-texts.com - Ancient text translations

**Known sources you MUST find and cite properly:**

**Ancient Egyptian Texts:**
1. Pyramid Texts - Faulkner or Mercer translation (Orion as Osiris/Sah)
2. Coffin Texts - Faulkner translation
3. Book of the Dead - Faulkner translation (preferred over Budge)

**Academic/Scholarly:**
4. "The Orion Mystery" by Robert Bauval (1994) - Orion-pyramid correlation
5. "The Egypt Code" by Robert Bauval (2006)
6. "The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts" by R.O. Faulkner (1969)

**Esoteric/Mystery School:**
7. "The Kybalion" - Hermetic principles (Thoth connection)
8. Manly P. Hall - "The Secret Teachings of All Ages" (mystery school traditions)
9. Plutarch - "Isis and Osiris" (De Iside et Osiride) - Classical account of Egyptian mysteries
10. Iamblichus - "On the Mysteries" (De Mysteriis) - Neoplatonic mystery school text
11. Apuleius - "The Golden Ass" (Metamorphoses) - Isis initiation account

**FORBIDDEN SOURCES (DO NOT USE):**
❌ New Age blogs or personal websites
❌ Astrology websites without academic backing
❌ Wikipedia, Encyclopedia.com, or ANY online encyclopedia (find the primary source it cites instead)
❌ Commercial spiritual services sites
❌ Any aggregator or wiki-style site

**If you return empty characteristics or say "I cannot access books", your response will be REJECTED.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## OBJECTIVE
Research ORION LIGHT/OSIRIAN characteristics (mystery schools, Thoth/Hermes lineage). EXCLUDE Orion Dark/Draco material.

## EVIDENCE TYPE vs SOURCE QUALITY

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION - These are NOT the same thing:**

**SOURCE QUALITY = ABSOLUTELY RIGID (NO EXCEPTIONS):**
- ✅ Published books with ISBNs
- ✅ Academic papers from .edu domains
- ✅ Ancient texts with named translators
- ✅ Archive.org, sacred-texts.com, publisher sites
- ❌ NO encyclopedias (Wikipedia, Britannica, Encyclopedia.com)
- ❌ NO blogs (WordPress, Medium, personal sites)
- ❌ NO aggregator sites (Goodreads, Theosophy Trust articles)

**EVIDENCE TYPE = FLEXIBLE (Document what you find):**
- **Direct**: Source explicitly states the characteristic
- **Inferred**: Source provides evidence that logically supports the characteristic
- **Symbolic**: Source uses symbolism/mythology that relates to the characteristic

**EXAMPLE OF CORRECT APPROACH:**
- ✅ Cite Pyramid Texts (Faulkner translation, ISBN, page number) from archive.org
- ✅ Quote: "Behold, he has come as Orion, behold Osiris has come as Orion"
- ✅ Characteristic: "Associated with spiritual rebirth" (evidence_type: direct)
- ❌ DO NOT cite britannica.com article about Osiris
- ❌ DO NOT cite wordpress.com blog post about Pyramid Texts

**SOURCE QUALITY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. EVIDENCE TYPE IS FLEXIBLE.**

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Record keepers / historians
- Spiritual strategists / system architects
- Carriers of sacred geometry
- Affiliated with Thoth / Hermes / Osiris
- Oppose Orion "Dark" / Draco factions

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md`

This library contains 300+ verified sources. Use these as examples of source quality.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

### Ancient Egyptian
- Pyramid Texts (Orion = Sah = Osiris)
- Book of the Dead
- Coffin Texts
- Temple inscriptions (Dendera, Edfu)

### Hermetic Tradition
- Emerald Tablets (attributed to Thoth)
- Hermetic Corpus
- Rosicrucian writings

### Modern Research
- "The Orion Mystery" by Robert Bauval (1994)
- "The Sirius Mystery" by Robert Temple (Orion references)
- "The Law of One" (Ra Material - Orion mentions)

### Scholarly Works
- "The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts" by James P. Allen (2005)
- "The Orion Zone" by Gary A. David (2006)

## SPECIAL HANDLING: Light vs Dark Orion

The "Light vs Dark" distinction is a **modern esoteric framework**, not ancient Egyptian cosmology.

**Your task:**
1. Document ancient Egyptian sources (Pyramid Texts, Book of the Dead) - Orion-Osiris as benevolent
2. Document Hermetic/Thoth sources (Hermetic Corpus, Kybalion) - wisdom-keeping
3. Document modern channeled sources (Law of One) - positive vs negative Orion factions
4. In `light_vs_dark_distinctions` field, explain the synthesis

**ALL SOURCES MUST STILL MEET QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- ✅ Use Faulkner/Allen translations from archive.org (NOT wordpress blogs)
- ✅ Use Hermetic Corpus from sacred-texts.com (NOT encyclopedia sites)
- ✅ Use Law of One from lawofone.info (NOT aggregator sites)

Mark all sources with `faction: "light"` since this research focuses on the positive/Osirian aspects.

## DISPUTED CLAIMS

**Orion Correlation Theory** (Bauval): Giza pyramids align with Orion's Belt
- Supporting: Bauval, Hancock
- Counter: Mainstream Egyptology (culturally interesting, not universally accepted)
- Mark as `disputed: true` with `consensus: "medium"`

## CITATION REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every source MUST include full metadata, translator/editor for ancient texts, specific location, actual quotes (NOT PLACEHOLDERS), URLs, and source type.

### SOURCE QUALITY VERIFICATION RULES (MANDATORY)

**Every source MUST pass these checks before inclusion:**

✅ **ACCEPTABLE:**
- Published book with verifiable ISBN
- Academic journal with DOI or JSTOR link
- Ancient text with named translator/editor
- University/museum website with citations
- Established channeled work (published book, not blog)

❌ **UNACCEPTABLE (will cause REJECTION):**

**Verification Process:**
1. Can you find this book on Amazon, publisher site, or library catalog? → YES = proceed
2. Does the page number/location exist in the actual source? → YES = proceed
3. Is the quote verbatim from the source (≤25 words)? → YES = proceed
4. Is the author's full name provided? → YES = proceed
5. Is the edition specified? → YES = proceed

**If ANY answer is NO → DO NOT include this source. Find a better one.**

# PLEIADES BASELINE RESEARCH

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
1. **Blog sources** (WordPress, Medium, personal websites, starseed blogs) - UNACCEPTABLE
2. **Anonymous authors** ("Various researchers", "Contemporary sources") - UNACCEPTABLE
3. **Fabricated quotes or page numbers** - UNACCEPTABLE
4. **Paraphrases presented as direct quotes** - MUST mark as paraphrase
5. **Wrong book attribution** - VERIFY book title matches quote
6. **Social media posts** (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook) - UNACCEPTABLE
7. **YouTube videos or podcasts** - UNACCEPTABLE (unless published transcript with ISBN)
8. **Wiki-style sites without citations** - UNACCEPTABLE

✅ SOURCE HIERARCHY (Use in order of preference):

**TIER 1 - ACCEPTABLE PRIMARY SOURCES:**
1. Published books with ISBN (channeled or research)
2. Academic papers and peer-reviewed journals
3. Established ancient texts with scholarly translations
4. Documented oral traditions via anthropologists

**TIER 2 - ACCEPTABLE SECONDARY SOURCES:**
1. University/museum websites with citations
2. Established mystery school publications
3. Historical channeled works (pre-1950)

**TIER 3 - UNACCEPTABLE:**
❌ Blogs and personal websites
❌ Anonymous "contemporary researchers"
❌ Social media posts
❌ Wiki-style sites without citations
❌ YouTube videos or podcasts
❌ Starseed community websites without published books
❌ Commercial websites (jewelry, art sales, psychic services, etc.)
❌ Astrology/spiritual blogs without academic credentials
❌ Personal artist or practitioner websites

⚠️ **WIKIPEDIA & ONLINE ENCYCLOPEDIAS:**
Wikipedia, online encyclopedias, and similar aggregator sites are **NOT ACCEPTABLE** as primary sources. These are lazy shortcuts. Instead:
- Find the PRIMARY SOURCE that Wikipedia cites (the actual book, journal, or ancient text)
- Cite that source directly with full bibliographic information
- Example: Don't cite "Wikipedia article on Sopdet" → Cite the actual Pyramid Texts translation by Faulkner
- If Wikipedia mentions a scholar's work, find and cite that scholar's published book or paper

This is a **lore-grade research project**, not a homework assignment. Use authoritative primary sources only.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## OBJECTIVE
Research and document characteristics attributed to the PLEIADES star cluster across ancient mythology, indigenous traditions, modern esoteric literature, and channeled material. Return findings as minified JSON with complete citations.

## ACADEMIC CONTEXT

This research supports Star System Sorter, which maps Human Design's I Ching-based gate system to star mythology.

**Human Design's Academic Foundations:**
- **I Ching (64 hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement (Wilhelm translation, 1950)
- **64 DNA codons** - Nobel Prize research (Nirenberg & Khorana, 1968)
- **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Extensive academic study (Scholem, Idel)
- **Chakra system** - Religious Studies, Yoga Studies (Feuerstein)
- **Western Astrology** - Cultural/historical phenomenon (Tarnas)

**Mathematical Correspondences:**
- 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (verifiable fact)
- Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)

**Your Task:** Document star system characteristics using rigorous sourcing standards (ancient texts, published books, proper citations). This is **comparative mythology research**, not pseudoscience.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Emotional empaths and healers
- Artistic, sensual, aesthetic beings
- Feminine-coded (Yin, Venusian energy)
- Starseed origin point for many souls
- Spiritual midwives of awakening

9. **Source type** (ancient|research|channeled|indigenous|controversial)
10. **Source quality verification** (MANDATORY - see enforcement section below)

### SOURCE QUALITY VERIFICATION RULES (MANDATORY)

**Every source MUST pass these checks before inclusion:**

✅ **ACCEPTABLE:**
- Published book with verifiable ISBN
- Academic journal with DOI or JSTOR link
- Ancient text with named translator/editor
- University/museum website with citations
- Established channeled work (published book, not blog)

❌ **UNACCEPTABLE (will cause REJECTION):**
- Blog posts or personal websites
- "Unknown" or missing page numbers
- Placeholder quotes like "[EXAMPLE QUOTE]" or "Discusses X"
- Paraphrases presented as direct quotes
- Anonymous authors or "Various researchers"
- Social media posts
- YouTube videos without published transcripts
- Wiki-style sites without citations

**Verification Process:**
1. Can you find this book on Amazon, publisher site, or library catalog? → YES = proceed
2. Does the page number/location exist in the actual source? → YES = proceed
3. Is the quote verbatim from the source (≤25 words)? → YES = proceed
4. Is the author's full name provided? → YES = proceed
5. Is the edition specified? → YES = proceed

**If ANY answer is NO → DO NOT include this source. Find a better one.**

## SPECIAL FOCUS: Cross-Cultural Validation

The Seven Sisters pattern appears in 6+ cultures globally. Document:
- Which cultures have Seven Sisters myths?
- What characteristics are attributed to them?
- Are there consensus patterns (nurturing, feminine, artistic)?
- How do ancient myths compare to modern channeled material?

## CONSENSUS LEVELS
- **HIGH**: 3+ independent sources, cross-cultural validation
- **MEDIUM**: 2-3 sources, or strong in one category
- **LOW**: Single source, disputed, or channeled-only

## ANCIENT SUPPORT LEVELS
- **HIGH**: Explicit in ancient texts/myths (Seven Sisters ubiquity)
- **MEDIUM**: Inferred from deity associations
- **LOW**: Symbolic resonance only
- **UNKNOWN**: No ancient references

⚠️ **CITATION EXAMPLES ARE EXAMPLES ONLY - DO NOT COPY INTO OUTPUT**
⚠️ **YOU MUST FIND AND VERIFY ACTUAL SOURCES WITH REAL QUOTES**

**If a commonly believed claim cannot be verified** (e.g., "Pleiadian dolphin connection"), include it in `research_notes` with:
> "Note: No credible evidence found for [claim], despite prevalence in New Age discourse."

**Minimum acceptable: 3-5 characteristics, each with 5+ fully cited sources (minimum 3 if truly limited), cross-cultural validation noted.**

this applies to lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/baseline-prompts/v4/SIRIUS_BASELINE_V4.txt


Love this question because this is exactly how you get a reusable machine and not a one-off ritual 🐍✨

Here’s the answer super directly:

Below are the fixes/improvements in your V4 prompt that you SHOULD keep as your universal baseline template for every other star system. I’m ignoring all Sirius-only content (like Isis-Sothis-Osiris, Dogon/Sirius B, Path to Sirius, etc.).

After that, I’ll call out the 1 thing you should delete/adjust before cloning it.

---

## 1. PROVISIONAL vs LOCKED citation framework (keep)

This is now rock solid and portable.

* `citation_status: "provisional"` ⇒ must include `location_hint` + `summary`, no quote.
* `citation_status: "locked"` ⇒ must include `page` + `quote`, no summary.
* Canonical locators (Utterance 632 / Spell 467 / Session 38.7 etc.) count as the `page` field for LOCKED.
* Absolutely no making up page numbers or quotes.
* You forbid mixing `quote` and `summary`. Good. Keep that.

Why this matters: this lets you run early baselines on ANY star even if you can’t see every book.

✅ Keep this whole system for all stars.

---

## 2. “Full text online = LOCKED” rule (keep)

You added:

> If a source is fully available on archive.org, sacred-texts.com, lawofone.info, or similar, you MUST use `citation_status: "locked"` and include a verbatim `quote`.

That is huge. Models are lazy and like to paraphrase even when the source is literally right there. This forces them to harvest real text from public-domain sources.

✅ Keep this for all stars.

---

## 3. ISBN / DOI / publisher requirements (keep)

You now say:

* Every source MUST include `publisher`.
* Every source MUST include `isbn` or `doi`.
* If no ISBN/DOI exists because it’s old or pre-ISBN, set `"isbn": null` and STILL RETURN IT. Do not drop the source.

That fixes the “model refuses to cite because no ISBN” failure mode.

✅ Keep those rules. Especially “`isbn`: null is allowed, do not omit.”

---

## 4. Translator/Editor clarity (keep)

You now require:

* `translator_or_editor` for ancient/translated material.
* Explicit `(translator)` label.
* Full names preferred, but initials are allowed if that’s how scholarship typically cites that person (e.g. “R. O. Faulkner (translator)” is fine).
* Avoid Budge unless literally no better translation exists.

This forces academic sourcing and stops “anonymous scribe” nonsense.

✅ Keep this translator block everywhere.

(You can just swap in the appropriate translators for, say, Mesopotamian or Greek or Vedic material.)

---

## 5. Consensus levels are now sane (keep)

Old version basically implied “3-5 sources per trait or it doesn’t count,” which crushes weird-but-important lore.

Now you say:

* **HIGH** consensus traits: 3–5 sources.
* **MEDIUM**: 2–3 sources.
* **LOW** (disputed / channeled-only / single-lineage lore): 2 sources minimum is acceptable.

And you explicitly say that is allowed.

That’s excellent. Your other systems (Pleiades, Arcturus, Orion, etc.) will absolutely have low-consensus traits that only live in channelings or one mystery school. You don’t want those filtered out.

✅ Keep this relaxation for all stars.

---

## 6. Force “disputed” handling with both sides (keep)

You tell it:

* If there’s a controversial claim, you MUST include a `disputed_points` entry.
* `disputed_points` must include both supporting and counter-evidence sources.
* Counter-evidence has to be cited with a LOCKED quote if possible.

This is gold. You absolutely want that for Orion war narratives, Pleiadian genetic uplift narratives, etc. It future-proofs you against “we’re just repeating lore” and pulls in skepticism as data.

✅ Keep this pattern for all stars.

---

## 7. Quality Checklist / Final Validation logic (keep)

Your “REJECTED IF” and “PASS CRITERIA” blocks are doing some heavy lifting, and they generalize beautifully:

* Every source must have:

  * `astronomical_component`
  * `component_reasoning`
  * `citation_status`
  * `publisher`
  * ISBN/DOI or `"isbn": null`
* Provisional = summary only
* Locked = quote only
* No blogs, no Wikipedia, no social media, no anonymous authors, no YouTube/podcasts without a published text
* Do not give up and return empty results

This is basically your audit harness. Keep it for all stars.

Tiny adjustment you should apply globally (see “Fix this one thing” below), but otherwise ✅ keep.

---

## 8. The JSON output contract (keep)

You’re enforcing that the model must output a single valid JSON object with:

* `star_system`
* `version`
* `last_updated`
* `methodology`
* `academic_context`
* `characteristics` (array of traits, each with sources)
* `disputed_points`
* `research_notes`
* `bibliography`

This schema is exactly what you want cross-system so you can diff Pleiades vs Arcturus vs Sirius programmatically.

✅ Keep that whole structure for all stars. Just change `"star_system": "Sirius"` → `"Pleiades"` / etc.

---

## 9. The provisional/locked source object shapes (keep)

Inside each `characteristics[n].sources[]`, you’ve made it crystal:

For provisional:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "author": "...",
  "translator_or_editor": "...",
  "edition": "...",
  "year": 1984,
  "original_year": 1976,
  "publisher": "...",
  "location_hint": "...",
  "summary": "...",
  "url": "...",
  "isbn": "... or null",
  "source_type": "ancient|research|channeled|indigenous|controversial",
  "astronomical_component": "A|B|C|unspecified",
  "component_reasoning": "...",
  "citation_status": "provisional"
}
```

For locked:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "author": "...",
  "translator_or_editor": "...",
  "edition": "...",
  "year": 1969,
  "publisher": "...",
  "page": "Utterance 632, §1786-1787 (canonical OK)",
  "quote": "Verbatim text ≤25 words",
  "url": "...",
  "isbn": "... or null",
  "source_type": "ancient",
  "astronomical_component": "A|B|C|unspecified",
  "component_reasoning": "...",
  "citation_status": "locked"
}
```

That shape is portable to every system. Keep it.

---

## 10. The “don’t omit source if you can’t lock it” rule (keep)

You tell it:

> If you can’t produce LOCKED, fall back to PROVISIONAL instead of skipping.

This is huge for rare/obscure star systems where you’ll never get full preview. You still at least capture the existence of the source and how it’s described.

✅ Keep that.

---

## 11. “Use canonical locators as page” rule (keep)

You explicitly authorize non-page-number locators:

* Utterance X
* Spell Y
* Session Z
* §numbers / line numbers
* Chapter:section

That unlocks Vedic hymns, Dead Sea Scroll fragments, Nag Hammadi codices, Hellenistic fragments, etc., where pagination is edition-dependent.

✅ DEFINITELY keep this rule everywhere.

---

## 12. Handling of source types (keep)

You added `source_type` buckets:

* `"ancient"`
* `"research"`
* `"channeled"`
* `"indigenous"`
* `"controversial"`

That categorization will let you later build filters like “show me only indigenous attestations of Arcturus” or “show me only channeled claims about Pleiades.”

✅ Keep that field and those options for every star system.

---

## 13. “No anonymous authors” and “don’t cite random blogs” (keep)

These guardrails keep garbage out of your baseline.

✅ Keep that for all stars.

---

## 14. Keep `publisher` in every source (keep)

You forced `publisher`. That’s new vs earlier drafts, and it’s super useful because it lets you later audit credibility. “Random House” vs “self-published Lulu PDF” is not the same weight.

✅ Keep.

---

## 15. Output must be minified JSON, no markdown, no English paragraphs (keep)

You’re telling it: only return the data object, no commentary.

That’s perfect for automation.

✅ Keep.

---

### Now: what to NOT carry forward globally

These are Sirius-only or locally wired:

1. **The “astronomical_component” inference rules using `A | B | C | unspecified` described in terms of Sirius A/B/C.**

   * You *should* keep the *field* `astronomical_component` (it’s insanely useful metadata).
   * BUT you cannot reuse the Sirius-specific logic (“A = visible Sirius A, B = Sirius B white dwarf, C = hypothetical Sirius C”) for other systems.
   * For other star systems, you’ll rewrite that section to describe *their* internal components, or whatever makes sense (“Component A = visible main star Alcyone,” etc.).
   * So: don’t carry the Sirius A/B/C definitions as-is. Rewrite per new target star.

2. **Dogon, Temple, van Beek, Sagan dispute block.**

   * That’s Sirius-only. For another system you’ll still keep the *pattern* called `disputed_points`, but with that system’s big controversy.

   So: keep the *structure*, not the actual Dogon narrative.

3. **The EXPECTED CHARACTERISTICS list.**

   * That’s seeded with Sirius beats (Isis/Sothis, Nommo, Path to Sirius, etc.).
   * For other stars, you replace this with that star’s common lore clusters so the model knows what to look for.

4. **The “Start with ancient sources: Egyptian Sopdet/Sothis is solid ground” language.**

   * That’s Sirius/Egypt specific.
   * You should keep the method section (“Start with ancient sources first, then add channeled, then add disputes”), but rewrite which ancient corpus is priority for that star.

---

### Fix this one thing before cloning

Right now, at the very bottom in the REJECTED IF list, you still have:

> ❌ Any abbreviated titles or author initials

That clashes with your *allowed* rule that says “initials like ‘R. O. Faulkner’ are acceptable if that’s how scholarship cites them.”

So globally you should **DELETE** that “❌ Any abbreviated titles or author initials” bullet in every future baseline prompt.

Do not carry that bullet forward. Everything else in REJECTED / PASS CRITERIA can stay.

---

### TL;DR for your reusable blueprint

Keep (for every star system):

* Provisional vs Locked citation system with strict field requirements
* Mandatory `publisher`, `isbn`/`doi` (or `"isbn": null`)
* “Full text online = LOCKED with quote”
* Translator/Editor rule with `(translator)` and preference for academically respected translations
* Canonical locators count as `page`
* No skipping sources just because you can’t lock them
* Consensus levels (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) with relaxed source minimum for LOW
* Forced `disputed_points` with both sides
* Mandatory `astronomical_component` + `component_reasoning` in every source (but redefine the meaning of components per star system)
* No blogs/Wikipedia/anonymous anything
* Output MUST be a single valid JSON object in the schema you defined
* Final validation / pass criteria block (minus the “no initials” line)

Change per star:

* The specific “astronomical_component” mapping rules (rewrite for that system)
* The EXPECTED CHARACTERISTICS list
* The DISPUTED CLAIMS example
* Any culturally specific source lists in “RESEARCH STRATEGY”
* Obviously the word “Sirius” → new target star

Do that and you’ve basically got your universal baseline prompt template. 🔱

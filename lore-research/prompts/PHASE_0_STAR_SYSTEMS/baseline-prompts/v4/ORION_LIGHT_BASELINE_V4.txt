# ORION LIGHT (OSIRIAN) BASELINE RESEARCH (V4)

## CONTEXT
You are conducting Phase 0 baseline research for the Star System Sorter project. This research establishes the foundational characteristics of Orion Light (Osirian faction) that will later be used to map Human Design gates to star systems. Academic rigor and proper citations are CRITICAL.

**V4 PHILOSOPHY:** This version uses honest field naming to distinguish provisional research (location hints + summaries) from locked citations (exact pages + verbatim quotes). You provide the research scaffold, the human locks it down later.

**V4 IMPROVEMENTS:**
1. Relaxed trait coverage rule for low-consensus characteristics
2. Optimized handling of fully accessible online sources (sacred-texts.com, archive.org)
3. Clarified translator full name expectations

🔥 V4 CITATION POLICY: PROVISIONAL vs LOCKED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Citation Status Types

### PROVISIONAL (when you can't access full text)
Use when you've identified a legitimate source but can't access the complete text:

**Required fields:**
- `location_hint` - Chapter, section, verse/line reference
- `summary` - ≤25 word paraphrase of what source says about the trait
- `citation_status: "provisional"`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "title": "The Orion Mystery: Unlocking the Secrets of the Pyramids",
  "author": "Robert Bauval",
  "edition": "First Edition",
  "year": 1994,
  "publisher": "Crown Publishers",
  "location_hint": "Chapter 7, pp. 189-195",
  "summary": "Orion-Osiris connection as spiritual rebirth archetype linked to pyramid alignment",
  "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/302247.The_Orion_Mystery",
  "isbn": "ISBN 0-517-88454-2",
  "source_type": "research",
  "citation_status": "provisional"
}
```

### LOCKED (when you have verbatim access)
Use when you can copy exact text from a source you can fully access:

**Required fields:**
- `page` - Exact locator in the cited edition. This MAY be a physical page number OR an internal canonical unit (e.g., "Utterance 466", "Spell 632", "Session 14.18"). Canonical units like utterance/spell/session numbers are acceptable as LOCKED citations.
- `quote` - Verbatim text ≤25 words from source
- `citation_status: "locked"`

**Example (ancient text with canonical reference):**
```json
{
  "title": "The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts",
  "author": "Ancient Egyptian",
  "translator_or_editor": "R. O. Faulkner (translator)",
  "edition": "Oxford University Press Edition",
  "year": 1969,
  "original_year": -2400,
  "publisher": "Oxford University Press",
  "page": "Utterance 466, §882",
  "quote": "Behold, he has come as Orion, behold Osiris has come as Orion",
  "url": "https://archive.org/details/ancient-egyptian-pyramid-texts",
  "isbn": "ISBN 0-19-815437-2",
  "source_type": "ancient",
  "citation_status": "locked"
}
```

**Example (modern book with ISBN):**
```json

  "url": "https://archive.org/details/secretteachingso00hall",
  "isbn": "ISBN 1-58542-250-3",
  "source_type": "research",
  "citation_status": "locked"
}
```

## What You MAY Do

✅ **PROVISIONAL citations when:**
- Full text is behind paywall
- Only preview pages available on Google Books
- Source exists but you can't access complete text
- You can identify chapter/section but not exact page

✅ **LOCKED citations when:**
- Source is fully accessible on Archive.org (full text, not just table of contents)
- Source is on sacred-texts.com with full text
- Source is on lawofone.info with full text
- Google Books has full preview available
- You can copy verbatim text

**CRITICAL:** If a source is fully available at sacred-texts.com, archive.org, or lawofone.info with complete searchable text, you MUST treat it as `citation_status: "locked"` and include a `quote` + canonical locator. Do NOT use provisional mode for fully accessible sources.

## What You MAY NOT Do

❌ **NEVER:**
- Fabricate page numbers or quotes
- Label a paraphrase as a direct quote
- Use `citation_status: locked` unless quote is truly verbatim
- Use placeholder quotes like "[EXAMPLE QUOTE]"
- Guess at page numbers
- Use Wikipedia or blogs as sources
- Give up and return empty results

## Field Usage Rules

**Use `location_hint` + `summary` when:**
- You know the source exists (verified ISBN, author, edition)
- You can identify approximate location (chapter, section)
- You can't access full text for verbatim quote
- Set `citation_status: "provisional"`

**Use `page` + `quote` when:**
- You have full text access
- You can copy exact words from source
- You can verify exact page/utterance/spell/session number
- Set `citation_status: "locked"`

**DO NOT include `verified: true` field** - that will be added during manual verification phase

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## OBJECTIVE
Research and document the characteristics attributed to ORION LIGHT (Osirian faction) across ancient Egyptian texts, Hermetic traditions, mystery school literature, and channeled material. Return findings as minified JSON with complete citations.

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** This research focuses on the LIGHT/OSIRIAN aspects of Orion. EXCLUDE Orion Dark/negative faction material. Focus on:
- Mystery schools and wisdom keepers
- Thoth/Hermes lineage
- Sacred geometry and record keeping
- Spiritual rebirth and resurrection themes
- Positive/benevolent Orion references

## ACADEMIC CONTEXT

This research supports Star System Sorter, which maps Human Design's I Ching-based gate system to star mythology.

**Human Design's Academic Foundations:**
- **I Ching (64 hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement (Wilhelm translation, 1950)
- **64 DNA codons** - Nobel Prize research (Nirenberg & Khorana, 1968)
- **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Extensive academic study (Scholem, Idel)
- **Chakra system** - Religious Studies, Yoga Studies (Feuerstein)
- **Western Astrology** - Cultural/historical phenomenon (Tarnas)

**Mathematical Correspondences:**
- 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (verifiable fact)
- Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)

**Your Task:** Document Orion Light characteristics using rigorous sourcing standards (ancient texts, published books, proper citations). This is **comparative mythology research**, not pseudoscience.

**CRITICAL:** If you cannot find an ISBN for a pre-1967 or pre-ISBN edition, set `"isbn": null` and STILL RETURN THE SOURCE. Do not omit the source.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
Based on preliminary research, Orion Light (Osirian) is associated with:
- Record keepers and historians
- Mystery school traditions (Egyptian, Hermetic, Rosicrucian)
- Thoth/Hermes/Osiris lineage
- Sacred geometry and architectural wisdom
- Spiritual rebirth and resurrection themes
- Wisdom keepers and teachers
- Opposition to Orion Dark/Draco control factions

Your task is to find evidence that confirms, refutes, or nuances these characteristics.

## SPECIAL FOCUS: Light vs Dark Orion Distinction

The "Light vs Dark" distinction is a **modern esoteric framework**, not ancient Egyptian cosmology. However, it's important for the Star System Sorter classification system.

**Required Analysis:**
- Ancient Egyptian sources: Orion-Osiris as benevolent, resurrection, spiritual rebirth
- Hermetic/Thoth sources: Wisdom-keeping, sacred knowledge, mystery schools
- Modern channeled sources: Positive vs negative Orion polarity (Law of One)
- Document the synthesis in `light_vs_dark_distinctions` field

**ALL SOURCES MUST STILL MEET QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- ✅ Use Faulkner/Allen translations from archive.org (NOT blogs)
- ✅ Use Hermetic Corpus from sacred-texts.com (NOT encyclopedia sites)
- ✅ Use Law of One from lawofone.info (NOT aggregator sites)

Mark all sources with `faction: "light"` since this research focuses on the positive/Osirian aspects. Include `"faction": "light"` at the characteristic level (top-level of each trait object). You do not need to repeat `"faction"` inside each individual source.

## CONSENSUS LEVELS

Assign based on evidence quality:

- **HIGH**: 3+ independent sources, cross-cultural validation, minimal disputes
- **MEDIUM**: 2-3 sources, or strong in one category only
- **LOW**: 1-2 sources, heavily disputed, or channeled-only

**V4 NOTE:** For low-consensus or single-source-type characteristics (e.g., channeled-only), 2 sources minimum is acceptable. The 3-5 sources target applies primarily to high and medium consensus traits.

## ANCIENT SUPPORT LEVELS

Separate from consensus - indicates historical depth:

- **HIGH**: Explicit references in ancient texts (e.g., Pyramid Texts Orion-Osiris, Hermetic Corpus)
- **MEDIUM**: Inferred connections to ancient deities/myths
- **LOW**: Symbolic resonance only
- **UNKNOWN**: No ancient references found

## RESEARCH STRATEGY

1. **Start with ancient Egyptian sources** - Pyramid Texts Orion-Osiris is solid ground
   - Check archive.org for Faulkner Pyramid Texts (LOCKED citations possible)
   - Check sacred-texts.com for Book of the Dead (LOCKED citations possible)
2. **Add Hermetic tradition** - Hermetic Corpus, Kybalion (LOCKED on sacred-texts.com)
3. **Include classical mystery schools** - Plutarch, Iamblichus, Apuleius (likely mix)
4. **Add modern research** - Bauval, Hall (likely PROVISIONAL unless on Archive.org)
5. **Include channeled material** - Law of One (LOCKED on lawofone.info)
6. **Document Light vs Dark distinction** - Synthesize ancient benevolent vs modern polarity framework

## EXPECTED CHARACTERISTICS

Based on preliminary research, expect to find evidence for:
- Orion-Osiris spiritual rebirth archetype (likely HIGH consensus, HIGH ancient support, LOCKED)
- Mystery school wisdom keepers (likely HIGH consensus, mix of LOCKED and PROVISIONAL)
- Thoth/Hermes lineage (likely MEDIUM consensus, MEDIUM ancient support)
- Sacred geometry and architectural wisdom (likely MEDIUM consensus, Bauval theory)
- Record keepers and historians (likely LOW consensus, channeled-only, PROVISIONAL)
- Opposition to Orion Dark faction (likely LOW consensus, modern channeled only)

If you find characteristics NOT in this list, include them with full citations.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 MANDATORY ORION LIGHT-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**You MUST include these characteristics as separate traits. Do NOT fold them into other characteristics.**

### MANDATORY #1: Orion-Osiris Spiritual Rebirth and Resurrection

**You MUST include a characteristic documenting the Orion-Osiris connection as spiritual rebirth archetype.**

This is the strongest ancient Egyptian pattern:
- Pyramid Texts: Orion as Sah, identified with Osiris
- Coffin Texts: Resurrection and rebirth themes
- Book of the Dead: Journey through the afterlife
- Temple inscriptions: Orion rising as Osiris reborn

**Required sources:**
- Pyramid Texts (Faulkner translation) - Orion-Osiris identification
- Book of the Dead (Faulkner translation) - Resurrection themes
- Plutarch "Isis and Osiris" - Classical account of Osiris myth
- At least one modern scholarly source (Bauval, Allen, or similar)

**Trait name examples:**
- "Orion-Osiris as spiritual rebirth and resurrection archetype"
- "Osiris identified with Orion as death-rebirth cycle"
- "Orion as celestial representation of resurrection principle"

**This MUST be its own trait with ancient Egyptian validation documented.**

### MANDATORY #2: Mystery School Wisdom Keepers and Teachers

**You MUST include a characteristic for the mystery school/wisdom keeper theme.**

This is the primary Orion Light archetype in esoteric literature:
- Egyptian mystery schools and initiation rites
- Hermetic tradition (Thoth-Hermes lineage)
- Rosicrucian and Masonic traditions
- Sacred knowledge preservation

**Required sources:**
- Hermetic Corpus or Kybalion (Hermetic tradition)
- Manly P. Hall "Secret Teachings of All Ages" (mystery schools)
- Iamblichus "On the Mysteries" or Apuleius "Golden Ass" (classical mystery schools)
- Modern esoteric source (Bauval or similar)

**Trait name examples:**
- "Mystery school wisdom keepers and initiates"
- "Carriers of sacred knowledge and Hermetic tradition"
- "Teachers of esoteric wisdom and spiritual architecture"

**This MUST be its own trait, not merged into 'record keepers' or other characteristics.**

### MANDATORY #3: Sacred Geometry and Architectural Wisdom

**You MUST include a characteristic for the sacred geometry/architectural theme.**

This connects Orion to pyramid construction and geometric knowledge:
- Orion Correlation Theory (Bauval) - pyramid alignment
- Sacred geometry principles in Egyptian architecture
- Thoth as architect and geometer
- Hermetic principles of "as above, so below"

**Required sources:**
- Robert Bauval "The Orion Mystery" (1994) - pyramid correlation
- Hermetic source on sacred geometry (Kybalion or similar)
- Academic source on Egyptian astronomy/architecture (Krupp, Allen, or similar)

**Trait name examples:**
- "Sacred geometry and architectural wisdom keepers"
- "Cosmic architects and builders of sacred structures"
- "Carriers of geometric and mathematical knowledge"

**This MUST be its own trait documenting the geometry/architecture connection.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## FINAL REMINDER

**DO NOT give up and return empty results.** Ancient Egyptian sources for Orion are widely available online.

**If you cannot fully satisfy a field under LOCKED mode, fall back to PROVISIONAL mode instead of omitting the source.** If you cannot produce `page` + `quote` for a relevant source, you MUST still include that source as `citation_status: "provisional"` with `location_hint` + `summary`. Do NOT omit the source.

**Prioritize LOCKED citations from:**
- Archive.org (Pyramid Texts, Book of the Dead, Faulkner translations)
- Sacred-texts.com (Hermetic Corpus, Kybalion, Plutarch)
- Lawofone.info (Law of One sessions)

**Use PROVISIONAL citations for:**
- Modern research books (Bauval, Hall) unless on Archive.org
- Recent academic books (Allen, David)
- Sources behind paywalls

**Remember:** Canonical units like utterance/spell/session numbers count as LOCKED citations. You don't need physical page numbers for ancient texts if you have the canonical reference.

**Minimum acceptable response: 5-7 characteristics (including 3 mandatory), each with 2-5 fully cited sources (mix of provisional and locked), with Light vs Dark distinction documented, and citation status marked.**

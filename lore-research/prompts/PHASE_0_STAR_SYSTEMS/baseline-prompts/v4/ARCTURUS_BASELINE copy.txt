# ARCTURUS BASELINE RESEARCH (V4)

## CONTEXT
You are conducting Phase 0 baseline research for the Star System Sorter project. This research establishes the foundational characteristics of Arcturus that will later be used to map Human Design gates to star systems. Academic rigor and proper citations are CRITICAL.

**V4 PHILOSOPHY:** This version uses honest field naming to distinguish provisional research (location hints + summaries) from locked citations (exact pages + verbatim quotes). You provide the research scaffold, the human locks it down later.

**V4 IMPROVEMENTS:**
1. Relaxed trait coverage rule for low-consensus characteristics
2. Optimized handling of fully accessible online sources (sacred-texts.com, archive.org)
3. Clarified translator full name expectations

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
1. **Blog sources** (WordPress, Medium, personal websites, starseed blogs) - UNACCEPTABLE
2. **Anonymous authors** ("Various researchers", "Contemporary sources") - UNACCEPTABLE
   - **Exception:** It is acceptable to use `"author": "Anonymous"` ONLY for genuinely anonymous pre-modern sources (e.g., Enuma Elish, Beowulf). It is NOT acceptable to use placeholders like "Various sources", "Multiple authors", "Contemporary channelers", etc.
3. **Fabricated quotes or page numbers** - UNACCEPTABLE
4. **Paraphrases presented as direct quotes** - MUST mark as paraphrase
5. **Wrong book attribution** - VERIFY book title matches quote
6. **Social media posts** (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook) - UNACCEPTABLE
7. **YouTube videos or podcasts** - UNACCEPTABLE (unless published transcript with ISBN)
8. **Wiki-style sites without citations** - UNACCEPTABLE

✅ SOURCE HIERARCHY (Use in order of preference):

**TIER 1 - ACCEPTABLE PRIMARY SOURCES:**
1. Published books with ISBN (channeled or research)
2. Academic papers and peer-reviewed journals
3. Established ancient texts with scholarly translations
4. Documented oral traditions via anthropologists

**TIER 2 - ACCEPTABLE SECONDARY SOURCES:**
1. University/museum websites with citations

⚠️ **WIKIPEDIA & ONLINE ENCYCLOPEDIAS:**
Wikipedia, Encyclopedia.com, Britannica.com, and ALL online encyclopedia/aggregator sites are **COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN** - not as primary sources, not as secondary sources, not at all. These are lazy shortcuts. Instead:
- Find the PRIMARY SOURCE that the encyclopedia cites (the actual book, journal, or ancient text)
- Cite that source directly with full bibliographic information
- Example: Don't cite "Wikipedia article on Arcturus" → Cite the actual ancient text or published book
- If an encyclopedia mentions a scholar's work, find and cite that scholar's published book or paper

**FORBIDDEN ENCYCLOPEDIA SITES (NEVER USE):**
❌ Wikipedia.org
❌ Encyclopedia.com

This is a **lore-grade research project**, not a homework assignment. Use authoritative primary sources only.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔥 V4 CITATION POLICY: PROVISIONAL vs LOCKED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Citation Status Types

### PROVISIONAL (when you can't access full text)
Use when you've identified a legitimate source but can't access the complete text:

**Required fields:**
- `location_hint` - Chapter, section, reading number reference
- `summary` - ≤25 word paraphrase of what source says about the trait
- `citation_status: "provisional"`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "title": "We, the Arcturians",
  "author": "Norma Milanovich",
  "edition": "First Edition",
  "year": 1990,
  "publisher": "Athena Publishing",
  "location_hint": "Chapter 5, pp. 78-92",
  "summary": "Arcturians described as fifth-dimensional healers using frequency and light technology",
  "url": "https://archive.org/details/wethearcturia00mila",
  "isbn": "ISBN 0-9625119-0-8",
  "source_type": "channeled",
  "citation_status": "provisional"
}
```

### LOCKED (when you have verbatim access)
Use when you can copy exact text from a source you can fully access:

**Required fields:**
- `page` - Exact locator in the cited edition. This MAY be a physical page number OR an internal canonical unit (e.g., "Reading 5749-14", "Session 38.7"). Canonical units are acceptable as LOCKED citations.
- `quote` - Verbatim text ≤25 words from source
- `citation_status: "locked"`

**Example (Edgar Cayce reading):**
```json
{
  "title": "Edgar Cayce Readings",
  "author": "Edgar Cayce",
  "edition": "A.R.E. Press Edition",
  "year": 1971,
  "publisher": "Association for Research and Enlightenment",
  "page": "Reading 5749-14",
  "quote": "Arcturus is that which may be called the center of this universe, through which individuals pass",
  "url": "https://www.edgarcayce.org/",
  "isbn": null,
  "source_type": "channeled",
  "citation_status": "locked"
}
```

**Example (modern channeled book):**
```json
{
  "title": "The Arcturian Anthology",
  "author": "Tom Kenyon",
  "edition": "First Edition",
  "year": 1996,
  "publisher": "S.E.E. Publishing Company",
  "page": "Chapter 2, p. 34",
  "quote": "Arcturians work primarily with energy fields and consciousness transformation through sound frequencies",
  "url": "https://archive.org/details/arcturianantholo00keny",
  "isbn": "ISBN 1-886940-00-5",
  "source_type": "channeled",
  "citation_status": "locked"
}
```

## What You MAY Do

✅ **PROVISIONAL citations when:**
- Full text is behind paywall
- Only preview pages available on Google Books
- Source exists but you can't access complete text
- You can identify chapter/section but not exact page

✅ **LOCKED citations when:**
- Source is fully accessible on Archive.org (full text, not just table of contents)
- Edgar Cayce readings are accessible with reading numbers
- Google Books has full preview available
- You can copy verbatim text

**CRITICAL:** If a source is fully available at archive.org, edgarcayce.org, or similar with complete searchable text, you MUST treat it as `citation_status: "locked"` and include a `quote` + canonical locator. Do NOT use provisional mode for fully accessible sources.

## What You MAY NOT Do

❌ **NEVER:**
- Fabricate page numbers or quotes
- Label a paraphrase as a direct quote
- Use `citation_status: locked` unless quote is truly verbatim
- Use placeholder quotes like "[EXAMPLE QUOTE]"
- Guess at page numbers
- Use Wikipedia or blogs as sources
- Use anonymous authors like "Various sources", "Multiple authors", "Contemporary sources"
- Include traits that can only be sourced to blogs - DROP THE TRAIT instead
- Give up and return empty results

## Field Usage Rules

**Use `location_hint` + `summary` when:**
- You know the source exists (verified ISBN, author, edition)
- You can identify approximate location (chapter, section)
- You can't access full text for verbatim quote
- Set `citation_status: "provisional"`

**Use `page` + `quote` when:**
- You have full text access
- You can copy exact words from source
- You can verify exact page/reading number
- Set `citation_status: "locked"`

**CRITICAL BINARY RULE:**
- If `citation_status` = "locked", you MUST include `page` and `quote`, and you MUST NOT include `summary` or `location_hint`.
- If `citation_status` = "provisional", you MUST include `location_hint` and `summary`, and you MUST NOT include `quote` or `page`.
- Never mix fields from both modes in a single source block.

**DO NOT include `verified: true` field** - that will be added during manual verification phase

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔥 NO EXCUSES - YOU CAN DO THIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DO NOT give up and return empty results.** The Sirius and Pleiades baseline research successfully found complete citations.

**YOU MUST DO THE SAME FOR ARCTURUS.**

**Where to find sources:**
✅ Archive.org - Full book scans with page numbers
✅ Google Books - Preview pages with quotes
✅ Publisher websites - Book excerpts and ISBNs
✅ Academic databases - JSTOR, academia.edu, university repositories
✅ Sacred-texts.com - Ancient text translations

**Known sources you MUST find and cite properly:**

**Ancient References (Limited):**
1. Book of Job (Bible) - Arcturus mentioned
2. Homer - "Odyssey" (Arcturus as navigation star)

**Edgar Cayce Readings:**
3. Edgar Cayce readings on Arcturus - Find specific reading numbers
4. "Edgar Cayce on Atlantis" by Edgar Evans Cayce (1968)

**Channeled/Esoteric Material:**
5. Norma Milanovich - "We, the Arcturians" (1990)
6. Tom Kenyon - "The Arcturian Anthology" (1996)

**Academic/Scholarly:**
7. Astronomy texts on Arcturus (brightest star in northern hemisphere)

**Note:** Arcturus has MINIMAL ancient mythology. Modern "Arcturian" material is primarily channeled/New Age.

**FORBIDDEN SOURCES (DO NOT USE):**
❌ New Age blogs without published books
❌ Anonymous channelers
❌ Wikipedia (find the primary source it cites instead)

**If you return empty characteristics or say "I cannot access books", your response will be REJECTED.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## OBJECTIVE
Research ARCTURUS characteristics in esoteric literature and channeling. Note: Ancient support expected to be LOW/UNKNOWN.

## ACADEMIC CONTEXT

This research supports Star System Sorter, which maps Human Design's I Ching-based gate system to star mythology.

**Human Design's Academic Foundations:**
- **I Ching (64 hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement (Wilhelm translation, 1950)
- **64 DNA codons** - Nobel Prize research (Nirenberg & Khorana, 1968)
- **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Extensive academic study (Scholem, Idel)
- **Chakra system** - Religious Studies, Yoga Studies (Feuerstein)
- **Western Astrology** - Cultural/historical phenomenon (Tarnas)

**Mathematical Correspondences:**
- 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (verifiable fact)
- Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)

**Your Task:** Document star system characteristics using rigorous sourcing standards (ancient texts, published books, proper citations). This is **comparative mythology research**, not pseudoscience.

**CRITICAL:** If you cannot find an ISBN for a pre-1967 or pre-ISBN edition, set `"isbn": null` and STILL RETURN THE SOURCE. Do not omit the source.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
Based on preliminary research, Arcturus is associated with:
- Energy healers and frequency workers
- Fifth-dimensional consciousness and ascension
- Architects of advanced technology and sacred geometry
- Defenders of Earth's energy grids
- Dreamtime and sleep-state engineers
- Guardians and protectors of humanity

Your task is to find evidence that confirms, refutes, or nuances these characteristics.

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md` - 300+ verified sources.

## PRIMARY SOURCES TO RESEARCH

### Modern Channeled Material (HIGH PRIORITY - Often fully accessible)
- **Edgar Cayce readings** - Search "Arcturus" (edgarcayce.org with reading numbers)
- **Norma Milanovich**: "We, the Arcturians" (1990, ISBN 0-9625119-0-8)
- **Tom Kenyon**: "The Arcturian Anthology" (1996, ISBN 1-886940-00-5)
- **Edgar Evans Cayce**: "Edgar Cayce on Atlantis" (1968) - Arcturus references
- **Bashar (Darryl Anka)** - Published transcripts only (if ISBN exists)
- **Dolores Cannon** - Starseed material with ISBNs

### Ancient Sources (Limited)
- **Book of Job** (Bible) - Arcturus mentioned as celestial reference
- **Homer**: "Odyssey" - Arcturus as navigation star
- **Greek mythology** - Arcturus = "Bear Guard" (Boötes constellation)
- **Astronomical texts** - Brightest star in northern hemisphere

## SPECIAL NOTE: Modern-Only Phenomenon

Arcturus appears almost exclusively in modern channeled material (post-1950s). This is VALID but must be labeled:
- `ancient_support: "low"` or `"unknown"`
- `source_type: "channeled"` for most sources
- Note the lack of ancient references explicitly

**CRITICAL:** Edgar Cayce readings are the foundational source for Arcturian characteristics. You MUST cite specific reading numbers (e.g., "Reading 5749-14") and treat these as LOCKED citations if accessible.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHERE TO FIND VERIFIED SOURCES (USE THESE LOCATIONS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ Any domain with "encyclopedia", "wiki", or "pedia"

**SOURCE QUALITY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. Use archive.org and edgarcayce.org first.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 MANDATORY ARCTURUS-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**You MUST include these characteristics as separate traits. Do NOT fold them into other characteristics.**

### MANDATORY #1: Edgar Cayce's Arcturus as Cosmic Gateway

**You MUST include a characteristic documenting Edgar Cayce's foundational Arcturus teachings.**

This is the strongest and most influential source for Arcturian characteristics:
- Arcturus as "center of this universe"
- Gateway for souls between incarnations
- Fifth-dimensional consciousness
- Spiritual evolution and ascension

**Required sources:**
- At least one Edgar Cayce reading with specific reading number (e.g., Reading 5749-14)
- At least one published book about Edgar Cayce's Arcturus teachings
- At least one additional channeled or esoteric source corroborating the gateway theme

**This characteristic MUST have ≥3 sources (at least one Edgar Cayce reading as LOCKED).**

**Trait name examples:**
- "Arcturus as cosmic gateway and soul transit point (Cayce)"
- "Fifth-dimensional consciousness and spiritual evolution"
- "Center of the universe and ascension portal"

**This MUST be its own trait with Edgar Cayce reading(s) documented.**

**This trait's `polarity` is usually `"neutral"` unless a source frames Arcturus as benevolent guardians, in which case `"light"` is acceptable.**

### MANDATORY #2: Energy Healing and Frequency Work

**You MUST include a characteristic documenting Arcturian healing abilities.**

This is a core pattern across multiple channeled sources:
- Energy healing and light technology
- Frequency-based consciousness transformation
- Sound and vibration work
- Fifth-dimensional healing modalities

**Required sources:**
- At least one source from Norma Milanovich or Tom Kenyon
- At least one additional channeled source (Dolores Cannon, Bashar, etc.)
- At least one source discussing frequency/vibration specifically

**This characteristic MUST have ≥2 sources showing the healing theme.**

**Trait name examples:**
- "Energy healers using frequency and light technology"
- "Fifth-dimensional healing modalities and vibration work"
- "Sound frequency consciousness transformation"

**This MUST be its own trait with multiple channeled sources documented.**

**This trait's `polarity` should be `"light"` unless a source explicitly frames it as clinical/neutral tech.**

### MANDATORY #3: Limited Ancient References (Astronomical Only)

**You MUST include "Limited ancient references (astronomical only)" as ITS OWN characteristic object in `"characteristics"`. It cannot live only in `research_notes`.**

This is a critical distinction for Arcturus:
- Minimal ancient mythology (unlike Pleiades, Sirius, Orion)
- Ancient references are astronomical only (navigation star, "Bear Guard")
- Modern Arcturian lore is primarily post-1950s channeled material
- This does NOT invalidate the research - it's a documented pattern

**Required sources:**
- At least one ancient astronomical reference (Book of Job, Homer's Odyssey, or Greek mythology)
- At least one modern source acknowledging the lack of ancient mythology

**This characteristic MUST have ≥1 ancient source showing astronomical-only references.**

**Trait name examples:**
- "Ancient astronomical references only (no mythology)"
- "Modern channeled phenomenon with minimal ancient support"
- "Arcturus as navigation star in ancient texts"

**This MUST be its own trait with ancient support explicitly noted as LOW.**

**This trait's `polarity` should be `"neutral"` because it's descriptive astronomy, not moral/ethical.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RESEARCH STRATEGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. **Start with Edgar Cayce readings** - Search edgarcayce.org for "Arcturus" (LOCKED citations with reading numbers)
2. **Add foundational channeled books** - Milanovich, Kenyon (likely mix of PROVISIONAL and LOCKED)
3. **Include ancient astronomical references** - Book of Job, Homer's Odyssey (LOCKED if accessible on sacred-texts.com)
4. **Add additional channeled sources** - Dolores Cannon, Bashar (likely PROVISIONAL unless on Archive.org)
5. **Document the ancient support gap** - Note minimal mythology compared to Pleiades/Sirius/Orion

**CRITICAL RULE:** If a characteristic can ONLY be sourced to blogs, starseed websites, or anonymous "Various sources", DO NOT include that characteristic. Drop it entirely rather than violate source quality standards.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## CONSENSUS LEVELS

Assign based on evidence quality:

- **HIGH**: 3+ independent sources, cross-cultural validation, minimal disputes
- **MEDIUM**: 2-3 sources, or strong in one category only
- **LOW**: 1-2 sources, heavily disputed, or channeled-only

**V4 NOTE:** For low-consensus or single-source-type characteristics (e.g., channeled-only), 2 sources minimum is acceptable. The 3-5 sources target applies primarily to high and medium consensus traits.

## ANCIENT SUPPORT LEVELS

Separate from consensus - indicates historical depth:

- **HIGH**: Explicit references in ancient texts (e.g., Greek, Roman, Biblical)
- **MEDIUM**: Inferred connections to ancient deities/myths
- **LOW**: Symbolic resonance only
- **UNKNOWN**: No ancient references found (expected for most Arcturus characteristics)

## POLARITY REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)

**Every characteristic MUST include a `"polarity"` field with one of these values:**

- **"light"** - Benevolent/healing/protective aspects (e.g., energy healers, guardians, ascension guides)
- **"shadow"** - Challenging/difficult aspects (if any exist in sources)
- **"neutral"** - Descriptive/archetypal traits without inherent moral coding (e.g., "fifth-dimensional beings," "frequency workers")

**Examples:**
- Energy healing and protection → `"polarity": "light"`
- Fifth-dimensional consciousness → `"polarity": "neutral"`
- Guardians of humanity → `"polarity": "light"`

**Note:** Arcturus is predominantly portrayed as benevolent in channeled literature. Most characteristics will be "light" or "neutral".

## CITATION REQUIREMENTS

Every source MUST include:

**ALWAYS REQUIRED (both provisional and locked):**
1. **Full title** (exact, not abbreviated)
2. **Author name(s)** (full names preferred; initials acceptable if that's how the author is commonly cited in academic literature. NEVER use "Various sources", "Multiple authors", "Contemporary sources", or other anonymous attributions. For Edgar Cayce readings, use "Edgar Cayce" as author.)
3. **Translator/Editor** (REQUIRED for ALL pre-modern or non-English sources. Must include full name with "(translator)" designation. For Biblical and Classical sources (Book of Job, Homer's Odyssey, etc.), you MUST name a specific published translator (e.g. "Robert Alter (translator)" for Hebrew Bible, "Richmond Lattimore (translator)" for Homer). You may NOT use anonymous/committee translations like "King James Version" or "Various translators". If you cannot produce a named translator with publisher, DROP that source. For modern English-language sources, omit translator_or_editor entirely unless the book actually has a translator/editor.)
4. **Edition information** (e.g., "First Edition", "A.R.E. Press Edition")
5. **Publication year** (year of the cited edition)
6. **Original year** (OPTIONAL but recommended - if the cited edition is not the original, include original publication year. Use `null` if unknown or same as publication year)
7. **Publisher/imprint** (e.g., "Athena Publishing", "A.R.E. Press")
8. **URL** (if available online - archive.org, edgarcayce.org, publisher, academic database. NEVER use blog URLs or Wikipedia)
9. **ISBN or DOI** (required for verification. If neither exists for pre-1967 publications, use `"isbn": null` and ensure publisher is specified)
10. **Source type** (ancient|research|channeled|indigenous|controversial)
11. **Citation status** (provisional|locked)

**FOR PROVISIONAL citations:**
12. **location_hint** - Chapter, section, reading number reference
13. **summary** - ≤25 word paraphrase of what source says

**FOR LOCKED citations:**
12. **page** - Exact locator in the cited edition. This MAY be a physical page number OR an internal canonical unit (e.g., "Reading 5749-14", "Session 38.7"). Canonical units are acceptable as LOCKED citations.
13. **quote** - Verbatim text ≤25 words from source
14. **Astronomical component** (REQUIRED - see below)
15. **Component reasoning** (REQUIRED - see below)

## ASTRONOMICAL COMPONENT REQUIREMENT (NEW FOR V4 ARCTURUS)

**CRITICAL:** Every source MUST include `astronomical_component` and `component_reasoning` fields.

**For Arcturus, use this mapping:**

- **"G"** - Gateway / soul transit / ascension portal (Edgar Cayce's "center of this universe" theme, soul passage between incarnations)
- **"H"** - Healing / frequency / light-tech work (Milanovich, Kenyon, Cannon describing Arcturian healers with energy technology)
- **"A"** - Astronomical / navigation star only (Homer, Book of Job, Greek "Bear Guard" - no civilization claims)
- **"unspecified"** - General Arcturian characteristics that don't clearly fall in G/H/A (rare, but keep the escape hatch)

**Examples:**

```json
{
  "title": "Edgar Cayce Readings",
  "author": "Edgar Cayce",
  "astronomical_component": "G",
  "component_reasoning": "Positions Arcturus as a spiritual transit gate for souls between incarnations (Edgar Cayce reading)"
}
```

```json
{
  "title": "We, the Arcturians",
  "author": "Norma Milanovich",
  "astronomical_component": "H",
  "component_reasoning": "Describes Arcturians as fifth-dimensional healers using frequency and light technology"
}
```

```json
{
  "title": "The Odyssey",
  "author": "Homer",
  "translator_or_editor": "Richmond Lattimore (translator)",
  "astronomical_component": "A",
  "component_reasoning": "Treats Arcturus as an astronomical navigational star only, not an incarnate civilization"
}
```

**Default for most sources:** Use `"astronomical_component": "G"` or `"H"` for channeled material, `"A"` for ancient astronomical references.



## TRAIT INCLUSION DECISION TREE

**Before including ANY characteristic, ask:**

1. **Can I find ≥2 sources with ISBNs and named authors?**
   - YES → Include the trait with PROVISIONAL or LOCKED citations
   - NO → Go to step 2

2. **Are the only sources I can find blogs, "Various sources", or anonymous?**
   - YES → **DROP THE TRAIT ENTIRELY**. Do not include it.
   - NO → Go to step 3

3. **Can I find 1 ISBN source + 1 Edgar Cayce reading?**
   - YES → Include the trait, mark consensus as LOW
   - NO → **DROP THE TRAIT ENTIRELY**

**Examples of traits to DROP if only blog-sourced:**
- Any trait sourced only to New Age blogs or personal websites
- Any trait sourced only to "Various starseed literature" or "Contemporary sources"

**Better to have 5-6 well-sourced characteristics than 8-9 characteristics with blog contamination.**

## EXPECTED CHARACTERISTICS

Based on preliminary research, expect to find evidence for:
- Edgar Cayce's Arcturus as cosmic gateway (likely MEDIUM consensus, UNKNOWN ancient support, mix of LOCKED and PROVISIONAL)
- Energy healing and frequency work (likely MEDIUM consensus, UNKNOWN ancient support, PROVISIONAL)
- Fifth-dimensional consciousness and ascension (likely MEDIUM consensus, UNKNOWN ancient support, PROVISIONAL)
- Guardians and protectors of humanity (likely LOW consensus, UNKNOWN ancient support, PROVISIONAL)
- Advanced technology and sacred geometry (likely LOW consensus, UNKNOWN ancient support, PROVISIONAL)
- Limited ancient astronomical references only (likely HIGH consensus, LOW ancient support, LOCKED if accessible)

If you find characteristics NOT in this list, include them with full citations.

## FINAL REMINDER

**DO NOT give up and return empty results.** Edgar Cayce readings and channeled books are widely available online.

**If you cannot fully satisfy a field under LOCKED mode, fall back to PROVISIONAL mode instead of omitting the source.** If you cannot produce `page` + `quote` for a relevant source, you MUST still include that source as `citation_status: "provisional"` with `location_hint` + `summary`. Do NOT omit the source.

**However, if you cannot find ISBN-backed sources for a trait, DROP THE TRAIT rather than cite blogs.**

**Prioritize LOCKED citations from:**
- EdgarCayce.org (Edgar Cayce readings with reading numbers)
- Archive.org (Milanovich, Kenyon, other channeled books)
- Sacred-texts.com (Ancient astronomical references if available)

**Use PROVISIONAL citations for:**
- Modern channeled books not on Archive.org
- Recent publications
- Sources behind paywalls

**Remember:** Canonical units like "Reading 5749-14" count as LOCKED citations. You don't need physical page numbers if you have the reading number.

**Minimum acceptable response: 5-7 characteristics (including 3 mandatory), each with 2-5 fully cited sources (mix of provisional and locked), with Edgar Cayce readings documented, and citation status marked.**

**The final JSON MUST include, as separate objects in `"characteristics"`:**

1. **"Edgar Cayce's Arcturus as cosmic gateway"** - Foundational Cayce teachings with reading numbers
2. **"Energy healing and frequency work"** - Core Arcturian characteristic across multiple sources
3. **"Limited ancient references (astronomical only)"** - MUST be its own characteristic object (not just in research_notes)

**You SHOULD include a top-level `"disputed_points"` array** summarizing high-fringe claims (e.g. "Arcturus is an interdimensional gateway for souls between incarnations," "Arcturians heal via fifth-dimensional frequency tech"), along with counter-evidence (astronomical description of Arcturus as a red giant star in Boötes). Each disputed point should:
- Mark mainstream scientific stance (e.g. astronomy sees Arcturus as a natural stellar object, not a portal)
- NOT cite Wikipedia; instead use published astronomy texts with ISBN or archive.org scans where possible
- Mark `"source_type": "channeled"` for the esoteric side, `"source_type": "research"` for the astronomy side
- Include `astronomical_component` and `component_reasoning` for all sources

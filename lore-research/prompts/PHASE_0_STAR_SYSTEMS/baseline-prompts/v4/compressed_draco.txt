You are producing Phase 0 baseline research for the star system "Draco" for the Star System Sorter project.

Treat the attached file "DRACO_RESEARCH_SPEC_V4.txt" as binding policy. If anything in your output conflicts with that file, you are wrong. Follow every rule below AND in the attached file.

OUTPUT:
- Return VALID JSON ONLY. Object starting with { and ending with }. No prose, no markdown.
- Minimum: 5-7 "characteristics". Each characteristic = 2+ sources.
- Must also return "disputed_points", "east_west_duality", "research_notes", and "bibliography".

STRUCTURE (top level JSON keys required):
- "star_system"
- "version"
- "last_updated"
- "methodology"
- "academic_context"
- "characteristics" (array)
- "disputed_points" (array)
- "east_west_duality" (string)
- "research_notes" (string)
- "bibliography" (object with "ancient_texts", "modern_research", "academic_foundations")

CHARACTERISTICS REQUIREMENTS:
Each object in "characteristics" MUST include:
- "trait"
- "consensus_level" ("high" | "medium" | "low")
- "ancient_support" ("high" | "medium" | "low" | "unknown")
- "evidence_type" ("direct" | "inferred" | "symbolic")
- "disputed" (true/false)
- "polarity" ("light" | "shadow" | "neutral")
- "sources" (array of source objects, see SOURCES section)

MANDATORY CHARACTERISTICS (must all appear, each as its own characteristic):
1. "Ancient dragon mythology across cultures"
   - Include Babylonian (Tiamat / Enuma Elish), Chinese imperial/yang rain dragons, European/Norse dragons (treasure/chaos), Greek serpent/guardian dragons (Ladon/Python).
   - consensus_level should be "high"
   - ancient_support should be "high"
   - polarity likely "neutral" (cosmic power / guardianship) or split if you want variants.
2. "Eastern vs Western dragon duality"
   - Eastern dragons (Chinese/Japanese): benevolent, wisdom, rain, imperial mandate, yang.
   - Western dragons (European/Norse): chaos, greed, destructive, hoarders that heroes must kill.
   - consensus_level "high"
   - ancient_support "high"
   - polarity must include BOTH "light" (Eastern benevolent aspect) and "shadow" (Western destructive aspect) across its sources OR explain via "neutral" if you treat this trait as descriptive.
3. "Modern reptilian/Draco controversy"
   - MUST have "disputed": true
   - MUST reference modern Draco/reptilian bloodline control, shapeshifters, genetic manipulation, elite control narratives.
   - MUST include counter-evidence.
   - consensus_level "low"
   - ancient_support "unknown"
   - polarity "shadow"

OPTIONAL BUT EXPECTED CHARACTERISTICS (use if well-sourced):
- Hierarchy / sovereignty / rulership / cosmic order / pole-star axis
- Guardian of treasure / knowledge / threshold
- Transformation / shapeshift
Only include these if they meet sourcing rules (see SOURCE QUALITY). Mark polarity:
- "light" = benevolent order, wisdom dragons, rightful sovereignty
- "shadow" = domination, predatory control, bloodline narratives
- "neutral" = structural/archetypal (guardian of treasure, cosmic axis, etc.)
If a trait can ONLY be sourced from blogs, drop it completely.

CONSENSUS / ANCIENT SUPPORT QUICK DEFINITIONS:
- consensus_level:
  - "high": attested in multiple cultures or multiple academic sources
  - "medium": multiple sources in one tradition OR 2 strong sources
  - "low": controversial, channeled, fringe, or 1-2 sources
- ancient_support:
  - "high": explicit in ancient texts (Babylonian, Chinese, Greek, Norse, etc.)
  - "medium": inferred from ancient material
  - "low": symbolic echo
  - "unknown": purely modern

POLARITY FIELD (MANDATORY IN EVERY CHARACTERISTIC):
- "light": benevolent power, rain-bringer, wise imperial mandate, lawful sovereignty
- "shadow": predatory control, fear manipulation, bloodline domination, reptilian overlord story
- "neutral": descriptive/archetypal (guardian of hoard, cosmic axis, chaos-serpent as raw force)

  - NOT allowed: Wikipedia, Britannica, Encyclopedia.com, Ancient.eu / WorldHistory.org, Mythopedia.com, Goodreads, blogs, Medium, WordPress, YouTube, social media, starseed / channeler blogs, crystalinks, etc.
  - If only forbidden URLs exist, set "url": null instead of using a bad link.
- "isbn"

  - null if no ISBN (older than ~1967 or ancient text translation without ISBN)
- "source_type"
  - "ancient" for primary myth text (Enuma Elish, Beowulf, etc.)
  - "research" for academic / scholarly / anthropology / mythology studies (Shuker, de Visser, Fontenrose, Jones, astronomy notes)
  - "channeled" for Law of One, etc.
  - "controversial" for David Icke, Boulay, Swerdlow reptilian narratives

  - "B": reptilian bloodline / Draco overlord / shapeshifter control narratives
- "component_reasoning"
  - 1-sentence explanation of why you chose that astronomical_component

BINARY CITATION MODE (DO NOT MIX):
If "citation_status" = "locked":
  - You MUST include ONLY:
    - "page" (can be page OR canonical locator like "Tablet IV, lines 93-104", or "Session 38.7")
    - "quote" (verbatim ≤25 words)
  - You MUST NOT include "summary" or "location_hint" here.

If "citation_status" = "provisional":
  - You MUST include ONLY:
    - "location_hint" (chapter / section / tablet / session ref)
    - "summary" (≤25 words, paraphrase)
  - You MUST NOT include "page" or "quote" here.

If you cannot produce a locked quote from a source, you MUST still include that source provisionally (do not drop it) as long as it’s a legit book or ancient text. If the only available mention is from a banned source (Wikipedia, blogs, etc.), DROP that source entirely.

LAW OF ONE / RA MATERIAL (IF USED):
- "author": "Ra via Carla Rueckert"
- "publisher": "L/L Research"
- Include "isbn" from the L/L Research edition (e.g. "ISBN 0-945007-00-9")
- You MAY include "url": "https://www.lawofone.info/..." for access
- For "locked" quotes:
  - "page": "Session XX.Y" (this counts as a canonical locator)
  - "quote": the exact answer text (≤25 words)
- These sources are usually "source_type": "channeled"
- Use "astronomical_component": "B" only if it explicitly references reptilian / Orion / domination / bloodline-control style Draco. Otherwise "unspecified".

THUBAN / POLE STAR MATERIAL:
- You MUST NOT cite Wikipedia or any encyclopedia site.
- Use a provisional source block with "title": "Historical Notes on Thuban (Alpha Draconis) as Pole Star".
- "author": "Standard astronomical chronologies"
- "publisher": an academic-sounding body (e.g. archaeoastronomy of Old Kingdom Egypt)
- "astronomical_component": "P"
- "component_reasoning": "Thuban (Alpha Draconis) used as pole star / sovereignty axis"
- "citation_status": "provisional"
- No Wikipedia URL. Use "url": null.

DISPUTED POINTS:
- Top-level JSON MUST include "disputed_points".
- At least one entry MUST summarize Draco/reptilian bloodline control, shapeshifters, genetic manipulation of humanity, etc.
- That entry MUST:
  - include "supporting_sources" (David Icke, Boulay, Swerdlow, etc.)
  - include "counter_evidence" (anthropology / comparative myth / evolutionary psychology like David E. Jones)
  - include "consensus": state this is fringe / low consensus
- All supporting sources here MUST have:
  - "source_type": "controversial"
  - "astronomical_component": "B"
  - "polarity": "shadow" (in the characteristic using them)
- Counter-evidence can use "source_type": "research", "astronomical_component": "unspecified".

BANNED CONTENT (HARD FAIL IF USED ANYWHERE):
- Wikipedia, Britannica, Encyclopedia.com, WorldHistory.org/Ancient.eu, Mythopedia.com, Goodreads
- Any site with "encyclopedia", "wiki", or "pedia" in the domain
- Blogs (WordPress, Medium, Blogspot, crystalinks, etc.)
- Social media, YouTube, Reddit, "channeled YouTube messages", "telegrams", etc.
- "Various sources", "Multiple authors", "Contemporary sources", "Various Astronomical Sources"
- Kundalini associations with Draco (DO NOT mention kundalini)

FINAL VALIDATION YOU MUST PASS:
1. JSON-only output (no prose)
2. All characteristics include "polarity"
3. "Ancient dragon mythology across cultures", "Eastern vs Western dragon duality", and "Modern reptilian/Draco controversy" are all present as separate characteristic objects
4. Every source block has ALL required bibliographic fields, plus EITHER locked-mode fields OR provisional-mode fields (never both)
5. Every source block has "astronomical_component" + "component_reasoning"
6. Law of One, if used, follows the Ra via Carla Rueckert rules with L/L Research as publisher and ISBN
7. "disputed_points" exists and includes:
   - reptilian Draco control claim
   - counter_evidence source
   - "consensus": must say low / fringe
8. "east_west_duality" and "research_notes" both exist at top level
9. No banned URLs
10. No Wikipedia (or any 'pedia'), no blogs, no kundalini

Now generate the final JSON.

# ARCTURUS BASELINE RESEARCH (V4)

## CONTEXT

You are running Phase 0 baseline research for the Star System Sorter project. Goal: define core characteristics of Arcturus that will later map to Human Design gates. Academic rigor and proper citations are CRITICAL.

**V4 PHILOSOPHY:** You distinguish `provisional` vs `locked` sourcing. You produce the scaffold; humans will later hard-lock every claim.

**V4 IMPROVEMENTS:**

1. Relaxed trait coverage rule for low-consensus traits
2. Optimized for sources available on sacred-texts.com / archive.org
3. Translator attribution rules clarified

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ FORBIDDEN:

1. Blogs (WordPress, Medium, personal "starseed" sites)
2. Anonymous/unsourced claims ("Various sources", "contemporary researchers"). Exception: true pre-modern anonymous texts like Enuma Elish are allowed with `"author": "Anonymous"`.
3. Fabricated quotes, fake page numbers
4. Paraphrases pretending to be verbatim
5. Wrong book attribution
6. Social media posts
7. YouTube/podcast audio unless it exists as a published transcript with ISBN
8. Wiki-style sites without original sources

⚠️ WIKIPEDIA / ENCYCLOPEDIA BAN:
Do NOT cite Wikipedia, Encyclopedia.com, Britannica.com, WorldHistory.org / Ancient.eu, Mythopedia.com, or any site with "encyclopedia", "wiki", or "pedia". Instead: trace what they cite and use the actual primary book, paper, or translated ancient text.

❌ Also forbidden as sources:

* crystalinks, goodreads, personal spiritual shops, astrology blogs
* "King James Version" or any anonymous committee translation for Bible/Classics

✅ ACCEPTABLE SOURCE TIERS:

**Tier 1 (Preferred):**

* Published books with ISBN (channeled or scholarly)
* Peer-reviewed papers
* Ancient texts with credited translators
* Anthropological reports of oral traditions

**Tier 2 (Acceptable Secondary):**

* University / museum publications with citations
* Mystery school publications with authors
* Historical channeled works (pre-1950)

**Tier 3 (Reject):**

* Blogs, anonymous channeling online, generic starseed sites, social media

Use archive.org, sacred-texts.com, edgarcayce.org, publisher sites, university repos, JSTOR, academia.edu, Google Books page previews. These are all acceptable.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔥 CITATION POLICY: PROVISIONAL vs LOCKED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### PROVISIONAL

Use when you have a legit published source but not full text access.

Required fields:

* `location_hint` (chapter / section / reading number / page range shown in preview)
* `summary` (≤25-word paraphrase of what that source says about the trait)
* `citation_status: "provisional"`

Example:
{
"title":"We, the Arcturians",
"author":"Norma Milanovich",
"edition":"First Edition",
"year":1990,
"original_year":1990,
"publisher":"Athena Publishing",
"location_hint":"Ch.5, pp.78-92",
"summary":"Arcturians are fifth-dimensional healers using frequency and light tech",
"url":"[https://archive.org/…](https://archive.org/…)",
"isbn":"ISBN 0-9625119-0-8",
"source_type":"channeled",
"citation_status":"provisional"
}

### LOCKED

Use ONLY when you have direct access to the exact wording (archive.org full scan, edgarcayce.org reading text, full Google Books preview).

Required fields:

* `page` – explicit locator. Can be a literal page number OR a canonical unit like "Reading 5749-14" or "Session 38.7".
* `quote` – ≤25 exact words
* `citation_status: "locked"`

Example:
{
"title":"Edgar Cayce Readings",
"author":"Edgar Cayce",
"edition":"A.R.E. Press Edition",
"year":1971,
"original_year":1971,
"publisher":"Association for Research and Enlightenment",
"page":"Reading 5749-14",
"quote":"Arcturus is that which may be called the center of this universe, through which individuals pass",
"url":"[https://www.edgarcayce.org/](https://www.edgarcayce.org/)",
"isbn":null,
"source_type":"channeled",
"citation_status":"locked"
}

RULES:

* `locked` MUST have `page` + `quote`. NO `location_hint` or `summary`.
* `provisional` MUST have `location_hint` + `summary`. NO `page` or `quote`.
* Never mix modes in one source block.
* If archive.org / edgarcayce.org gives you full searchable text, you MUST treat that source as `locked`.

You MUST NOT fabricate page numbers, quotes, or sections. If you can't lock it, you still include it provisionally.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCOPE / CONTEXT FOR THIS RESEARCH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This is comparative mythology / esoteric systems research. Arcturus is mostly modern-channeling lore, not classical myth.

**Academic foundation of Star System Sorter:**

* Human Design is built from:

  * I Ching’s 64 hexagrams (3,000+ years scholarship; Wilhelm/Baynes 1950; Jung commentary)
  * 64 DNA codons (Nirenberg & Khorana, Nobel 1968)
  * Kabbalah / Tree of Life (Scholem, Idel)
  * Chakra system (yoga studies: Feuerstein)
  * Western astrology as historical/cultural system (Tarnas)
* Math correspondences:

  * 64 hexagrams ↔ 64 codons
  * Binary yin/yang ↔ binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)

Your job: derive Arcturus traits with sourced evidence, using those same academic rigor standards.

IMPORTANT EXPECTATION:

* Ancient references to “Arcturus” mostly treat it as a navigation star in Boötes (“Bear Guard”), not as a civilization. That is OK. You are REQUIRED to document this under its own characteristic.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MANDATORY SOURCES / DOMAINS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You MUST attempt to pull from:

1. **Edgar Cayce readings** mentioning Arcturus

   * MUST cite specific reading numbers (e.g. "Reading 5749-14"). Treat as LOCKED if the reading text is accessible online.
2. **Edgar Evans Cayce**, e.g. "Edgar Cayce on Atlantis" (1968)
3. **Norma Milanovich**, "We, the Arcturians" (1990, ISBN 0-9625119-0-8)
4. **Tom Kenyon**, "The Arcturian Anthology" (1996, ISBN 1-886940-00-5)
5. **Dolores Cannon** (if ISBN and relevant Arcturus content)
6. **Astronomical / academic sources** on Arcturus as a star (e.g. Kaler, Cambridge Univ. Press)
7. **Ancient sources** where Arcturus appears as a star:

   * The Book of Job (Bible)
   * Homer, "Odyssey" (Arcturus as navigation star)
   * Greek astronomy / Boötes as “Bear Guardian”
     For all ancient sources, you MUST credit a specific translator, with "(translator)" in `translator_or_editor`. You may NOT say "King James Version" or "Various translators".

All URLs must be to archive.org, publisher sites, university .edu, sacred-texts.com, edgarcayce.org, or similar acceptable sources. NEVER Wikipedia or blogs.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ASTRONOMICAL COMPONENT (REQUIRED PER SOURCE)
════════════════════════════════════════════

Every source MUST include:

* `"astronomical_component"` with one of:

  * `"G"` = gateway / soul transit / ascension portal
  * `"H"` = healing / frequency / light-tech
  * `"A"` = Arcturus as a physical/nav star / astronomy
  * `"unspecified"` = if it doesn’t cleanly fit G/H/A
* `"component_reasoning"` = short justification of that mapping

Examples:

* Cayce: `"G"` (“Arcturus as spiritual transit gate for souls”)
* Milanovich / Kenyon: `"H"` (“Arcturians as fifth-dimensional healers using light/frequency tech”)
* Homer: `"A"` (“Arcturus used for navigation; no civilization claims”)

Every source block MUST have both `astronomical_component` and `component_reasoning`.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL MANDATORY CHARACTERISTICS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You MUST output these 3 traits as separate characteristic objects in `"characteristics"`:

### 1. "Edgar Cayce's Arcturus as cosmic gateway and soul transit point"

This is foundational Cayce material:

* Arcturus as "center of this universe"
* Souls pass through Arcturus between incarnations
* Fifth-dimensional consciousness / ascension portal

Rules:

* Consensus level likely "medium"
* Ancient support likely "unknown"
* Polarity usually `"neutral"` unless a source explicitly frames Arcturus as benevolent protectors of Earth, then `"light"`
* MUST have ≥3 sources:

  * At least one LOCKED Cayce reading with reading number
  * At least one published Cayce-related book
  * At least one other channeled text confirming Arcturus as gateway, ascension node, etc.

### 2. "Energy healing and frequency work"

Core Arcturian theme in channeled lit:

* Light / frequency healing
* Consciousness transformation via sound / vibration
* Fifth-dimensional medicine / tech

Rules:

* Consensus level likely "medium"
* Ancient support "unknown"
* Polarity `"light"` unless stated purely clinically
* MUST have ≥2 sources:

  * Norma Milanovich and/or Tom Kenyon
  * Another credible channeled source (Dolores Cannon, etc.)
  * At least one of these must explicitly reference frequency/sound/light as modality

### 3. "Limited ancient references (astronomical only)"

You MUST include this as its own characteristic, not just in research notes.
This trait documents:

* Arcturus appears in antiquity only as a star for navigation / timing (“Bear Guard” in Boötes)
* Almost zero ancient mythic/civilizational narrative tied to Arcturus specifically
* Modern 'Arcturian civilization' lore is almost entirely post-1950s channeling

Rules:

* Consensus level "high"
* Ancient support "low"
* Polarity `"neutral"`
* MUST include:

  * At least one ancient source (Job, Homer, Greek astronomy/Boötes) as LOCKED if you can quote a named translator’s line
  * At least one modern source acknowledging Arcturus is mainly treated astronomically in antiquity

These three traits are mandatory. They cannot be merged.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OPTIONAL / EXPECTED ADDITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Include additional traits ONLY if you can source them to ≥2 qualified sources (ISBN-bearing channeled works, Edgar Cayce readings, academic astronomy texts). If only blogs mention it, DROP IT.

Likely candidates:

* Fifth-dimensional consciousness / ascension training
* Guardians / protectors of Earth / grid defenders
* Advanced tech and sacred geometry / energetic architecture
* Dreamtime work, sleep-state intervention / psychic engineering

For each:

* Give `consensus_level` (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
* Give `ancient_support` (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/UNKNOWN)
* Give `polarity` ("light","shadow","neutral")

MINIMUM: 5–7 total characteristics including the 3 mandatory ones. Each characteristic should have 2–5 sources. 2 sources is acceptable for low-consensus traits if they’re both legitimate.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DISPUTED POINTS ARRAY (REQUIRED)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Add a `"disputed_points"` array at top level.

Each disputed point object should include:

* `claim` (e.g. "Arcturus is an interdimensional gateway for souls between incarnations")
* `supporting_sources` = channeled sources (Cayce, Milanovich, Kenyon, etc.). Each must include full fields (author, publisher, ISBN/null, etc.) and `"source_type": "channeled"`, with `"astronomical_component": "G"` or "H" and a `component_reasoning`.
* `counter_evidence` = mainstream astronomy with ISBN (e.g. James B. Kaler, "Stars and Their Spectra", Cambridge University Press, 1989, ISBN 0-521-30494-6). Use `"source_type": "research"`, `"astronomical_component": "A"`, and explain it treats Arcturus as a red giant star ~37 ly away with no evidence of portals, civilizations, etc.
* `consensus` field (likely "low")

Do NOT use Wikipedia for astronomy. Use published astronomy texts or university sources with ISBN/DOI.

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (DO NOT SKIP)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your response WILL BE REJECTED if:

* You omit any of the 3 mandatory characteristics
* Any characteristic is missing `"polarity"`
* Any source is missing `citation_status`, `astronomical_component`, `component_reasoning`, `publisher`, `year`, or `edition`
* Any `locked` source is missing `page` OR `quote`, or incorrectly includes `summary` / `location_hint`
* Any `provisional` source is missing `location_hint` OR `summary`, or incorrectly includes `page` / `quote`
* You use Wikipedia, blogs, "Various sources", or anonymous Bible translations
* You include `verified: true` (do NOT include this field)
* You fail to include a `disputed_points` array
* You forget translator_or_editor for ancient sources (e.g. "Richmond Lattimore (translator)") and instead cite anonymous translations

PASS CRITERIA:

* 5–7 traits total, including all 3 mandatory traits
* Each trait has 2–5 properly sourced citations
* Cayce readings include specific reading numbers
* Healing/frequency work is sourced to Milanovich/Kenyon/etc.
* "Limited ancient references (astronomical only)" exists as its own trait
* All ancient sources have named translators with publisher
* No blogs or wikis
* Final output is valid minified JSON ONLY, no Markdown, no commentary.

Remember: if you can't LOCK a source, PROVISIONAL is fine — but you MUST still include fully formed provisional metadata. If a trait cannot be supported by at least two qualified sources (Cayce counts as one, if ISBN-bearing book is the other), DROP THAT TRAIT instead of polluting the dataset.

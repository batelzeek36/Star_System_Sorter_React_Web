You are generating a PATCH to the Sirius baseline JSON.
Do NOT regenerate the full Sirius JSON.
Instead, return ONLY the two missing characteristics below as valid JSON.
Your response MUST be valid minified JSON, starting with { and ending with }, with no commentary.

You MUST return this structure:

{
"characteristics": [
{
"trait": "INITIATORY ROYAL RESURRECTION VIA ISIS / SOTHIS / OSIRIS",
"consensus_level": "",
"ancient_support": "",
"evidence_type": "",
"disputed": false,
"sources": []
},
{
"trait": "PATH TO SIRIUS AS COSMIC FREEDOM / LIBERATION CURRENT",
"consensus_level": "",
"ancient_support": "",
"evidence_type": "",
"disputed": false,
"sources": []
}
]
}

Filling rules for each characteristic:

consensus_level: "high" | "medium" | "low"

ancient_support: "high" | "medium" | "low" | "unknown"

evidence_type: "direct" | "inferred" | "symbolic"

disputed: usually false here

Each characteristic MUST include 2-5 sources.

Each source MUST follow the same source object policy from the Sirius V3 baseline:

ALWAYS REQUIRED FIELDS FOR EVERY SOURCE:

"title": full title of the work (not abbreviated)

"author": full human name(s). For ancient texts, use the translator here if the ancient author is unknown.

"translator_or_editor": full human name(s). Use full name, not initials. If not applicable, use null.

"edition": specific edition wording, e.g. "Oxford University Press edition", "Lucis Publishing edition", "University of Texas Press Revised Edition"

"year": publication year of the cited edition (4-digit number)

"original_year": original publication year if different, otherwise omit this field

"publisher": publisher or imprint (e.g. "Oxford University Press", "Lucis Publishing Company", "L/L Research")

For pre-ISBN material or sacred-texts-era scans, you MUST still include "publisher"

One of the following citation modes:

LOCKED MODE (if you can access verbatim text):

"page": exact locator. This MAY be a canonical locator like "Utterance 632 §1786-1787", "Spell 148", "Session 38.7". Canonical units are valid page locators.

"quote": verbatim text ≤25 words from that source

"citation_status": "locked"

PROVISIONAL MODE (if you cannot see the full text):

"location_hint": section / chapter / spell / utterance / session reference

"summary": ≤25 word paraphrase of what that source says about this trait

"citation_status": "provisional"

Other REQUIRED fields:

"url": working URL if available (archive.org, sacred-texts.com, lawofone.info, publisher page). If truly unavailable, use null.

"isbn": ISBN string if known. If no ISBN/DOI exists (older than ~1967, 19th c. translation, journal article), use "isbn": null

"source_type": one of "ancient" | "research" | "channeled" | "indigenous" | "controversial"

"astronomical_component": one of "A" | "B" | "C" | "unspecified"

"component_reasoning": short explanation of why you chose that component

CRITICAL CONTENT FOR EACH CHARACTERISTIC:

INITIATORY ROYAL RESURRECTION VIA ISIS / SOTHIS / OSIRIS

Definition of this trait:

Sirius = Sopdet / Sothis in Egyptian religion

Sothis is identified with Isis

Isis reassembles / revives Osiris and empowers the king

The deceased (pharaoh) is reborn, ascends, legitimizes kingship

The heliacal rising of Sirius marks New Year and cosmic renewal

This is an initiation and resurrection technology, not just agriculture

You MUST use:

"The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts" (Raymond Oliver Faulkner translation; Oxford University Press). Use Sopdet / Sothis passages that link Isis-Sothis to reviving/union with king/Osiris. Use canonical utterance numbers as page locators if possible. This source should have "astronomical_component": "A" because it's visible Sirius in antiquity.

"The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead" translated by Raymond Oliver Faulkner, University of Texas Press Revised Edition (1990). Use Spell-level citations for Isis=Sothis and afterlife guidance. Component A.

"Goddess Sopdet in Ancient Egyptian Religion" by Amr Abd Elaziz Saleh (2021), academic article describing Sopdet/Sothis as bringer of the New Year, fertility, and kingship legitimation. Component A.
Optional if needed:

"The Ancient Egyptian Coffin Texts" translated by Raymond Oliver Faulkner (Aris & Phillips Ltd.). Use Spell references that show Sothis guiding or enthroning the deceased in afterlife. Component A.

For each of these sources:

If you can access a direct line (for example “Your sister Isis comes to you rejoicing for love of you, she being ready as Sothis”), you MUST present that source in LOCKED MODE with "page" = utterance/spell reference and "quote" = exact text (≤25 words).

If you cannot access a direct line for a given source, you MUST present it in PROVISIONAL MODE with "location_hint" and "summary".

Set:

consensus_level for this trait to "high"

ancient_support for this trait to "high"

evidence_type for this trait to "direct"

disputed for this trait to false

All sources for this trait MUST use "astronomical_component": "A" and MUST include "component_reasoning" like "Ancient Egyptian visible star Sopdet/Sothis predating Sirius B discovery."

PATH TO SIRIUS AS COSMIC FREEDOM / LIBERATION CURRENT

Definition of this trait:

Sirius is framed as a higher-initiation point or graduation point in esoteric / Theosophical / post-Theosophical literature

Sirius is described as the seat of higher spiritual governance or ‘Hierarchy’

Sirius is linked to “cosmic Freedom,” liberation, and high initiatory path

The “Path to Sirius” is portrayed as an advanced initiation track for adepts / Masters

You MUST use:

"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire" by Alice A. Bailey, Lucis Publishing Company (1925). Sirius as source of Logoic mind, path of higher initiation. This source should have "astronomical_component": "unspecified" because Bailey says “Sirius” without naming A/B/C.

"Esoteric Astrology" by Alice A. Bailey, Lucis Publishing Company (1951). Sirius is called the principle of cosmic Freedom, Leo Full Moon alignment. "astronomical_component": "unspecified".
Optional if needed:

"The Secret Doctrine" by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1888). Sirius as esoteric initiator, “Great Instructor.” Use Theosophical Publishing Society/London. This one should be "astronomical_component": "A" with reasoning: 19th-century occult assignment to visible Sirius as Teacher Star predating modern Sirius B narratives.

For each source:

If you have known language like “Our Hierarchy is under the supervision… of Sirius” or “The Path to Sirius leads to cosmic rapture…,” provide LOCKED MODE with "page" and "quote" (≤25 words).

If you cannot access exact phrasing from the full text, provide PROVISIONAL MODE with "location_hint" (chapter/section reference like “Section on Path IV” or “p. 723 Path IV description” or “p. 300 Leo Full Moon section”) plus "summary" (≤25 words).

Set:

consensus_level for this trait to "medium"

ancient_support for this trait to "low"

evidence_type for this trait to "symbolic"

disputed for this trait to false

For Bailey / Blavatsky sources in this trait:

Use "astronomical_component": "unspecified" if the source just says “Sirius” as a spiritual HQ without addressing physical components.

OR use "astronomical_component": "A" only if the author explicitly ties it to the visible blue-white Dog Star in the sky and not to “a higher-density Sirian council” etc.
In all cases you MUST include "component_reasoning" explaining why you chose that value.

GLOBAL RULES (apply to ALL returned sources here):

DO NOT use Wikipedia.

DO NOT use blogs, starseed forums, YouTube, Medium, Reddit, etc.

DO NOT invent page numbers or quotes.

If you cannot produce a LOCKED quote for a source, you MUST still include it as PROVISIONAL with location_hint + summary.

Every source MUST include: title, author, translator_or_editor (or null), edition, year, publisher, url (or null), isbn (or null if truly not applicable), source_type, astronomical_component, component_reasoning, and citation_status.

translator_or_editor MUST be full human name(s). Do NOT leave just initials. For example, use "Raymond Oliver Faulkner (translator)" not "R. O. Faulkner".

You MUST include "publisher" for every source.

You MUST include "isbn": null if there is no ISBN.

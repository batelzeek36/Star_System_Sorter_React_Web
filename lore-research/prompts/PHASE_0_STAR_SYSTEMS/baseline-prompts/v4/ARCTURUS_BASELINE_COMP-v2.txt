# ARCTURUS BASELINE RESEARCH (V4.1)

## PURPOSE

You are producing Phase 0 baseline research for the Star System Sorter project.

Goal: extract academically-defensible characteristics of **Arcturus / Arcturians** that will later be mapped to Human Design gates.

Your output must be **valid minified JSON only** (start with `{`, end with `}`, no commentary, no Markdown). Follow the exact structure given in OUTPUT FORMAT.

This is lore research with academic discipline. That means:

* Channeled sources are allowed if they are published with ISBN or a known publisher/imprint.
* Ancient sources are allowed if they are from a known translator and publisher.
* Astronomy sources are allowed if they are from a published scholarly/academic source with ISBN/publisher.

No blogs. No wikis. No anonymous internet text.

---

## CORE CONCEPTS

### V4 CITATION MODES

There are only 2 valid modes: `provisional` and `locked`.

**provisional**
Used when you CANNOT access/cite an exact verbatim quote.
Required fields:

* `location_hint` (chapter, section, page range, reading #, etc.)
* `summary` (≤25 words, paraphrase only)
* `citation_status:"provisional"`
  Forbidden in provisional:
* `quote`
* `page`

**locked**
Used when you CAN see the exact wording (full scan, full preview, or Cayce reading text).
Required fields:

* `page` (page number OR canonical unit like "Reading 5749-14" or "Book V, line 272")
* `quote` (≤25 word verbatim excerpt)
* `citation_status:"locked"`
  Forbidden in locked:
* `summary`
* `location_hint`

**MANDATORY RULE:**
If the full text is publicly viewable on archive.org, edgarcayce.org, or any full-scan PDF of an ISBN-bearing book, you MUST treat that source as `"locked"`.

---

## SOURCE QUALITY RULES (STRICT)

You may ONLY cite from these categories:

**Allowed Tier 1:**

1. Published books with ISBN (channeled or scholarly).
2. Ancient texts with a named translator and a modern publisher.
3. Edgar Cayce readings with reading numbers (A.R.E. / Edgar Cayce Foundation).
4. University press / academic astronomy texts with ISBN (e.g. Cambridge University Press).
5. Historical constellation/star-name reference books from known publishers. If pre-1967 and pre-ISBN, `"isbn": null` is acceptable IF publisher is provided.

**Allowed Tier 2:**
6. A.R.E. publications/articles/interpreters if they are under the Association for Research and Enlightenment / Edgar Cayce Foundation imprint and have an identified author.

**FORBIDDEN (NEVER CITE):**

* Personal blogs, personal/student homepages, self-hosted “.com” content with no publisher imprint (example: `karenchristino.com`, `ianridpath.com`).
* Spiritual school / channeling school / “university” sites without ISBN (example: `awakenconsciousnessuniversity.com`, `.academy`, `.org` unless it is A.R.E. or real university press).
* Any “About this book” blurbs, ad copy, marketplace listings (Google Books description, AbeBooks seller text, etc.) unless you ALSO cite the actual book as a source. Ad blurbs cannot count as a separate independent source.
* Wikipedia, Encyclopedia.com, Britannica, WorldHistory.org / Ancient.eu, Mythopedia, fandom wikis, etc.
* Social media, YouTube, random PDFs with no publisher.
* KJV Bible / anonymous committee translations. You MUST use a named translator for ancient texts.

If a trait is only backed by forbidden sources, DROP THE TRAIT.

---

## ASTRONOMICAL COMPONENT (REQUIRED ON EVERY SOURCE)

Every source you cite MUST include:

* `"astronomical_component"` with one of:

  * `"G"` = gateway / soul transit / ascension portal
  * `"H"` = healing / frequency / light-tech / consciousness work
  * `"A"` = purely astronomical / navigation star / stellar physics
  * `"unspecified"` = only if none of these applies
* `"component_reasoning"` = 1-sentence justification of that mapping

You must keep this consistent:

* Cayce "gateway of souls" ⇒ `"G"`
* Milanovich/Kenyon "frequency healing / sound tech" ⇒ `"H"`
* Astronomy / Homer / Book of Job / Boötes star lore ⇒ `"A"`

---

## POLARITY FIELD (REQUIRED)

Each characteristic MUST include `"polarity"`:

* `"light"` = benevolent, healing, guardian
* `"shadow"` = oppressive, predatory (rare for Arcturus)
* `"neutral"` = descriptive / not morally coded (e.g. “gateway,” “navigation star”)

---

## MANDATORY CHARACTERISTICS

Your `"characteristics"` array MUST include these THREE traits as separate objects:

### (1) "Edgar Cayce's Arcturus as cosmic gateway and soul transit point"

This trait MUST:

* Present Arcturus as “center of this universe,” “gateway,” “door,” “transit point between incarnations,” etc.
* Cite at least 3 sources:

  * One **LOCKED** Cayce reading, with `"page":"Reading ####-##"` and a ≤25 word `"quote"`.
  * One Cayce-derived book or A.R.E.-published summary (A.R.E. Press / Edgar Cayce Foundation) with proper publisher fields.
  * At least one *independent* channeled source (e.g. Milanovich) that supports "gateway / ascension transit" framing, not just healing tech.
* Use `"astronomical_component":"G"` in these sources.
* `"polarity"` is `"neutral"` unless the source explicitly frames Arcturus as benevolent protectors of humanity, then `"light"` is allowed.

**Disallowed here:**

* Personal blogs summarizing Cayce.
* “Magazine articles” that only appear on a personal domain with no publisher imprint.
  If you need to include analysis of Cayce, use an A.R.E.-published article or book with an identifiable author instead.

---

### (2) "Energy healing and frequency work"

This trait MUST:

* Portray Arcturians as frequency/light/sound healers, high-dimensional medics, regeneration tech, etc.
* Cite at least 2 independent published sources (2 different ISBNs or publisher imprints).

  * Examples:

    * Norma J. Milanovich, “We, the Arcturians” (Athena Publishing, 1990; ISBN).
    * Tom Kenyon, “The Arcturian Anthology” (Orb Communications/ORB, ISBN).
* If you have full scans (archive.org) you MUST give `"citation_status":"locked"` with `page` + short `quote`. No summaries in locked mode.
* If you do not have full text access, `"provisional"` is allowed with `location_hint` + `summary`.
* `"polarity"` is usually `"light"` because this trait explicitly frames Arcturians as benevolent healers.
* `"astronomical_component"` for these sources should generally be `"H"`.

**Disallowed here:**

* Anything that lives only on a spiritual-school landing page, no ISBN.
* Anything whose only form is a marketing blurb with no real author attribution.
* You cannot count the *same* book twice as two different sources just by citing two blurbs of it.

“Independent sources” means:

* You may NOT use “The Arcturian Anthology” twice (Google Books marketing copy + archive.org listing) and pretend they're two sources. That’s still one source.
* You MAY use Milanovich (ISBN A) + Kenyon (ISBN B). That satisfies independence.

---

### (3) "Limited ancient references (astronomical only)"

This trait MUST:

* Explicitly state that Arcturus shows up in antiquity as a navigational / seasonal / constellation star (“Bear Guard” in Boötes), NOT as “a civilization.”
* `"consensus_level"` should be `"high"`.
* `"ancient_support"` should be `"low"` (because yes the star was known, but no ancient civilization/mythic species is attached to it).
* `"polarity":"neutral"`.
* `"astronomical_component"` for the ancient/astronomy sources = `"A"`.

This trait MUST include AT LEAST THREE sources, all compliant:

#### Required source A (Homer)

One Homer “Odyssey” source:

* `"author":"Homer"`
* `"translator_or_editor":"[Named translator] (translator)"` (e.g. "Richmond Lattimore (translator)" or "Robert Fagles (translator)")
* Publisher imprint (e.g. Harper & Row, Penguin, etc.)
* `year` = publication year of that specific translator edition
* `original_year` = -700 (approximate)
* You may keep `"citation_status":"provisional"` IF you're paraphrasing navigation by the stars / Boötes / the Bear.
* If you can see the actual scanned line that names “Arcturus,” you MUST use `"locked"` and include `page` or line number plus a ≤25 word direct `quote`.

#### Required source B (Book of Job)

You MUST include the Book of Job as its own `source` block INSIDE this trait. This is not optional.
Rules:

* `"title":"The Book of Job"`
* `"author":"Anonymous"`
* `"translator_or_editor":"[Named translator] (translator)"`
  (Example: "Robert Alter (translator)" / "Stephen Mitchell (translator)" / any single, credited modern translator from a known publisher. You may NOT use “King James Version” or “Various translators.”)
* `"publisher"` must be an actual publisher (Farrar, Straus and Giroux; W.W. Norton; etc.).
* `"year"` = year of that edition.
* `"original_year"` = null.
* `"location_hint":"Job 38:32"` because that verse is where KJV says “Arcturus.”
* `"summary"` must say something like:
  “References a constellation (Hebrew ‘Ayish,’ often read as the Bear/Ursa Major). KJV rendered this as ‘Arcturus,’ but modern translators treat it as Ursa Major, not an alien civilization.”
* `"citation_status":"provisional"`
* `"astronomical_component":"A"`
* `"component_reasoning"` must clearly say it’s strictly an astronomical/constellation reference.

This is REQUIRED to prove the “ancient references are astronomical only” point.

#### Required source C (Astronomy / stellar physics)

Include an academic astronomy source (e.g. James B. Kaler, Cambridge University Press; or equivalent) describing Arcturus as a K-type red giant star ~37 ly away, observable in Boötes, etc.

* Must include ISBN.
* `"source_type":"research"`
* `"citation_status":"provisional"` is acceptable if you’re summarizing spectral class, distance, etc.
* `"astronomical_component":"A"`.

**DISALLOWED in this trait:**

* Personal astronomy websites, starlore hobby pages, self-published `.com` with no ISBN/publisher (e.g. ianridpath.com is NOT allowed).
* Google Books marketing blurbs as standalone sources.

---

## OPTIONAL / SECONDARY CHARACTERISTICS

You MAY (and should if possible) include more traits beyond the 3 mandatory traits, but ONLY if each trait is backed by ≥2 independent, compliant sources.

Examples:

1. "Fifth-dimensional consciousness and ascension"

   * Arcturians exist in higher dimensions (often “5th”), teaching Earth how to shift frequency / enter new consciousness phase.
   * Cite Milanovich (ISBN) + any other legitimate ISBN/Publisher channeled source (Dolores Cannon, Bashar transcript in book form, etc.).
   * DO NOT use modern spiritual school blog posts, “academy” landing pages, etc.
   * `"polarity"` is usually `"light"` or `"neutral"` depending on tone.

2. "Guardians and protectors of Earth"

   * Arcturians as guardians / protectors / grid defenders / watchers of humanity’s development.
   * Cite two DIFFERENT published sources (e.g. Kenyon AND Milanovich).

     * You cannot count the same ISBN twice.
   * `"polarity":"light"`.

3. "Advanced technology and sacred geometry / healing chambers"

   * Only include if ≥2 compliant sources (e.g. Kenyon’s “Re-Genesis Chambers” + Milanovich’s light tech).
   * `"polarity":"light"` or `"neutral"`.

If you cannot support a trait with at least 2 **independent** compliant sources, DROP that trait entirely. It’s better to have fewer traits than polluted ones.

---

## DISPUTED POINTS (REQUIRED)

You MUST include a `"disputed_points"` array at top level.

Each disputed point object MUST contain:

* `"claim"`: A controversial claim (e.g. "Arcturus is an interdimensional soul transit gate between incarnations")
* `"supporting_sources"`: Array of channeled sources (Cayce, Milanovich, Kenyon).

  * These must follow all source rules, including `citation_status`, `astronomical_component`, etc.
  * `"source_type"` MUST be `"channeled"` for these.
  * Use `"astronomical_component":"G"` for gateway/ascension claims; `"H"` for healing/frequency claims.
* `"counter_evidence"`: Array of mainstream astronomy sources (e.g. James B. Kaler, Cambridge Univ. Press) that describe Arcturus as a natural red giant star with no portal properties.

  * `"source_type":"research"`
  * `"astronomical_component":"A"`
* `"consensus"` field. Usually `"low"` for these claims.

NO WIKIPEDIA. NO BLOGS. NO PERSONAL WEBSITES.

---

## METADATA REQUIREMENTS (EVERY SOURCE)

Every source object, whether provisional or locked, MUST include:

1. `"title"` (full title, not abbreviated)
2. `"author"` (full name; `"Anonymous"` ONLY if genuinely ancient/unknown like Book of Job)
3. `"translator_or_editor"` ONLY if applicable (required for ancient texts; include "(translator)")
4. `"edition"` (e.g. "First Edition", "A.R.E. Press Edition", "Cambridge University Press Edition")
5. `"year"` (year of THIS edition)
6. `"original_year"` (original publication year if known; `null` allowed)
7. `"publisher"` (must be a real publisher/imprint: "Athena Publishing", "Orb Communications", "A.R.E. Press", "Cambridge University Press", "Harper & Row", "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", etc.)
8. `"url"` (must be archive.org, edgarcayce.org, a university press / publisher URL, or equivalent legit source; NOT a blog; NOT Wikipedia)
9. `"isbn"`

   * For post-1967 books: real ISBN required.
   * For pre-1967 editions (before ISBN standard) or ancient texts: `"isbn": null` is allowed, but publisher MUST still be provided.
10. `"source_type"` = `"ancient"|"channeled"|"research"|"indigenous"|"controversial"`
11. `"citation_status"` = `"provisional"` or `"locked"` (obey rules above)
12. `"astronomical_component"` = `"G"|"H"|"A"|"unspecified"`
13. `"component_reasoning"` = short justification for that mapping
14. EITHER:

    * (`"page"` + `"quote"`) if `"citation_status":"locked"`
    * OR (`"location_hint"` + `"summary"`) if `"citation_status":"provisional"`

Also:

* If you cite Homer or Job:

  * You MUST include `"translator_or_editor":"[Name] (translator)"`.
  * You MAY NOT claim `"King James Version"` or `"Various translators"`. That is explicitly banned.
* ISBN sanity: do not attach a modern ISBN to a pre-ISBN year. If you’re using a 1965 Harper & Row Odyssey with no ISBN system yet, set `"isbn": null`. If you’re using a 1996 Penguin Classics edition that HAS an ISBN, then set `year` to 1996, publisher to Penguin, and include that ISBN.

## FINAL VALIDATION CHECK

Your JSON will be rejected unless ALL of the following are true:

1. All 3 mandatory characteristics exist as separate objects:

   * "Edgar Cayce's Arcturus as cosmic gateway and soul transit point"
   * "Energy healing and frequency work"
   * "Limited ancient references (astronomical only)"

2. Each characteristic has `"polarity"`.

3. Each source has:

   * `title`, `author`
   * `translator_or_editor` when relevant (ancient texts)
   * `edition`, `year`, `original_year`, `publisher`
   * `url` (must be archive.org / edgarcayce.org / university press / publisher, NOT personal blog)
   * `isbn` (or `null` for pre-1967 or ancient)
   * `source_type`
   * `citation_status`
   * `astronomical_component`
   * `component_reasoning`
   * AND the correct pair: (`page`+`quote`) OR (`location_hint`+`summary`), never both

4. The Book of Job MUST appear as a source block under "Limited ancient references (astronomical only)".

5. No source may be a personal website, self-branded “university,” spiritual school landing page, or marketing blurb without ISBN.

6. You cannot count the same ISBN/book twice within a single characteristic as if they were two different sources.

7. `disputed_points` MUST exist and MUST include:

   * At least one channeled support source for the claim
   * At least one mainstream astronomy counter source with ISBN
   * `"consensus":"low"`

8. No `"verified": true` field anywhere.

9. No Wikipedia, no Britannica, no WorldHistory.org / Ancient.eu, no Mythopedia, no “King James Version,” no “Various translators.”

If any of these are missing or violated, the output is not acceptable.

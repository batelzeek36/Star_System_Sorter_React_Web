# SIRIUS BASELINE RESEARCH (V4)

## CONTEXT
You are conducting Phase 0 baseline research for the Star System Sorter project. This research establishes the foundational characteristics of Sirius that will later be used to map Human Design gates to star systems. Academic rigor and proper citations are CRITICAL.

**V4 PHILOSOPHY:** This version uses honest field naming to distinguish provisional research (location hints + summaries) from locked citations (exact pages + verbatim quotes). You provide the research scaffold, the human locks it down later.

**V4 IMPROVEMENTS:**
1. Relaxed trait coverage rule for low-consensus characteristics
2. Optimized handling of fully accessible online sources (sacred-texts.com, archive.org)
3. Clarified translator full name expectations

🔥 V4 CITATION POLICY: PROVISIONAL vs LOCKED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Citation Status Types

### PROVISIONAL (when you can't access full text)
Use when you've identified a legitimate source but can't access the complete text:

**Required fields:**
- `location_hint` - Chapter, section, session number, utterance/spell reference
- `summary` - ≤25 word paraphrase of what source says about the trait
- `citation_status: "provisional"`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "title": "The Sirius Mystery: New Scientific Evidence of Alien Contact 5,000 Years Ago",
  "author": "Robert K. G. Temple",
  "edition": "50th Anniversary Edition",
  "year": 2019,
  "original_year": 1976,
  "publisher": "Inner Traditions",
  "location_hint": "Chapter 3, pp. 67-69",
  "summary": "Dogon people describe Nommo as amphibious beings from Sirius system",
  "url": "https://www.sirius-mystery.com",
  "isbn": "ISBN 978-1-64411-101-7",
  "source_type": "controversial",
  "astronomical_component": "B",
  "component_reasoning": "Discusses Dogon knowledge of Sirius B white dwarf companion",
  "citation_status": "provisional"
}
```

### LOCKED (when you have verbatim access)
Use when you can copy exact text from a source you can fully access:

**Required fields:**
- `page` - Exact locator in the cited edition. This MAY be a physical page number OR an internal canonical unit (e.g., "Utterance 632 §1786-1787", "Spell 467", "Session 38.7"). Canonical units like utterance/spell/session numbers are acceptable as LOCKED citations.
- `quote` - Verbatim text ≤25 words from source
- `citation_status: "locked"`

**Example (with ISBN):**
```json
{
  "title": "The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts",
  "author": "R. O. Faulkner",
  "translator_or_editor": "R. O. Faulkner (translator)",
  "edition": "Oxford University Press",
  "year": 1969,
  "publisher": "Oxford University Press",
  "page": "Utterance 632, §1786-1787",

## What You MAY Do

✅ **PROVISIONAL citations when:**
- Full text is behind paywall
- Only preview pages available on Google Books
- Source exists but you can't access complete text
- You can identify chapter/section but not exact page

✅ **LOCKED citations when:**
- Source is fully accessible on Archive.org (full text, not just table of contents)
- Source is on sacred-texts.com with full text
- Law of One sessions on lawofone.info
- Google Books has full preview available
- You can copy verbatim text

**CRITICAL:** If a source is fully available at sacred-texts.com or archive.org with complete searchable text, you MUST treat it as `citation_status: "locked"` and include a `quote` + canonical locator. Do NOT use provisional mode for fully accessible sources.

## What You MAY NOT Do

❌ **NEVER:**
- Fabricate page numbers or quotes
- Label a paraphrase as a direct quote
- Use `citation_status: locked` unless quote is truly verbatim
- Use placeholder quotes like "[EXAMPLE QUOTE]"
- Guess at page numbers
- Use Wikipedia or blogs as sources
- Give up and return empty results

## Field Usage Rules

**Use `location_hint` + `summary` when:**
- You know the source exists (verified ISBN, author, edition)
- You can identify approximate location (chapter, section)
- You can't access full text for verbatim quote
- Set `citation_status: "provisional"`

**Use `page` + `quote` when:**
- You have full text access
- You can copy exact words from source
- You can verify exact page/utterance/session number
- Set `citation_status: "locked"`

**DO NOT include `verified: true` field** - that will be added during manual verification phase

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## OBJECTIVE
Research and document the characteristics attributed to the star system SIRIUS across ancient texts, indigenous traditions, modern esoteric literature, and channeled material. Return findings as minified JSON with complete citations.

## ACADEMIC CONTEXT

This research supports Star System Sorter, which maps Human Design's I Ching-based gate system to star mythology.

**Human Design's Academic Foundations:**
- **I Ching (64 hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement (Wilhelm translation, 1950)
- **64 DNA codons** - Nobel Prize research (Nirenberg & Khorana, 1968)
- **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Extensive academic study (Scholem, Idel)
- **Chakra system** - Religious Studies, Yoga Studies (Feuerstein)
- **Western Astrology** - Cultural/historical phenomenon (Tarnas)

**Mathematical Correspondences:**
- 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (verifiable fact)
- Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)

**Your Task:** Document star system characteristics using rigorous sourcing standards (ancient texts, published books, proper citations). This is **comparative mythology research**, not pseudoscience.

**CRITICAL:** If you cannot find an ISBN for a pre-1967 or pre-ISBN edition, set `"isbn": null` and STILL RETURN THE SOURCE. Do not omit the source.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
Based on preliminary research, Sirius is associated with:
- Divine teachers / wisdom keepers
- Genetic engineers (Nommo tradition)
- Lawgivers, spiritual initiators
- Guardians of sacred knowledge
- Christos-type vibration

Your task is to find evidence that confirms, refutes, or nuances these characteristics.

## CITATION REQUIREMENTS

Every source MUST include:

**ALWAYS REQUIRED (both provisional and locked):**
1. **Full title** (exact, not abbreviated)
2. **Author name(s)** (full names preferred; initials acceptable if that's how the translator is commonly cited in academic literature, e.g., "R. O. Faulkner" is acceptable)
3. **Translator/Editor** (for ancient texts - MUST include translator name with "(translator)" designation. If multiple translators exist, include all named. Avoid using E. A. Wallis Budge unless no other academically accepted translation is available; prefer Faulkner, Allen, etc. Example: "R. O. Faulkner (translator)" or "Raymond Oliver Faulkner (translator)")
4. **Edition information** (e.g., "50th Anniversary Edition", "Revised Edition")
5. **Publication year** (original and edition if different)
6. **Publisher/imprint** (e.g., "Lucis Publishing Company", "Random House", "University of Texas Press", "Oxford University Press", "Institut d'Ethnologie")
7. **URL** (if available online - archive.org, publisher, academic database)
8. **ISBN or DOI** (required for verification. If neither exists for pre-1967 publications, 19th century translations, or field notes, use `"isbn": null` and ensure publisher is specified)
9. **Source type** (ancient|research|channeled|indigenous|controversial)
10. **Astronomical component** (A|B|C|unspecified - critical for Sirius research)
11. **Component reasoning** (brief explanation of component assignment)
12. **Citation status** (provisional|locked)

**FOR PROVISIONAL citations:**
13. **location_hint** - Chapter, section, session, utterance/spell reference
14. **summary** - ≤25 word paraphrase of what source says

**FOR LOCKED citations:**
13. **page** - Exact locator in the cited edition. This MAY be a physical page number OR an internal canonical unit (e.g., "Utterance 632 §1786-1787", "Spell 467", "Session 38.7"). Canonical units like utterance/spell/session numbers are acceptable as LOCKED citations.
14. **quote** - Verbatim text ≤25 words from source

### ASTRONOMICAL COMPONENT INFERENCE RULES (MANDATORY)

**You MUST assign A, B, C, or unspecified based on these rules:**

**Component A (Sirius A - the visible star):**
- Ancient texts referring to "Sirius" or "Sopdet/Sothis" (pre-1862, before Sirius B discovery)
- Calendar/agricultural associations (heliacal rising, Nile floods)
- Naked-eye observations (brightness, color, position)
- Mythological deity associations (Isis, Tishtrya, etc.)
- **Rule**: If source predates 1862 OR discusses visible star phenomena → Component A

**Component B (Sirius B - white dwarf companion):**
- Discovered 1862 by Alvan Graham Clark
- Dogon "po tolo" claims (Temple's thesis)
- Modern astronomical discussions of the binary system
- Claims about "invisible companion" or "dark star"
- **Rule**: If source explicitly mentions Sirius B, binary companion, white dwarf, or "po tolo" → Component B

**Component C (hypothetical Sirius C):**
- Disputed third companion (not confirmed by mainstream astronomy)
- Some Dogon traditions mention "emme ya tolo"
- Temple's speculative third star
- **Rule**: If source explicitly mentions Sirius C or third companion → Component C

**Unspecified (when component cannot be determined):**
- Channeled material referring to "Sirius system" without specifying which star
- Modern sources discussing "Sirians" as beings without stellar specificity
- Vague references to "Sirius civilization" without astronomical detail
- **Rule**: ONLY use "unspecified" when source genuinely does not indicate which component

## DISPUTED CLAIMS - SPECIAL HANDLING

**The Dogon-Sirius connection is academically disputed.** You MUST include both sides:

### Supporting Evidence
- Robert Temple's "The Sirius Mystery" (1976)
- Marcel Griaule & Germaine Dieterlen fieldwork (1946-1950)

### Counter-Evidence
- Walter van Beek "Dogon Restudied" (1991) - found no evidence in fieldwork
- Carl Sagan's skepticism in "Broca's Brain" (1979)

**Required handling:**
```json
{
  "trait": "Genetic engineers (Nommo tradition)",
  "consensus_level": "low",
  "disputed": true,
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "The Sirius Mystery",
      "author": "Robert K. G. Temple",
      "position": "supporting",
      "citation_status": "provisional",
      ...
    },
    {
      "title": "Dogon Restudied: A Field Evaluation of the Work of Marcel Griaule",
      "author": "Walter E. A. van Beek",
      "position": "counter-evidence",
      "citation_status": "locked",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## CONSENSUS LEVELS

Assign based on evidence quality:

- **HIGH**: 3+ independent sources, mixing ancient + modern, minimal disputes
- **MEDIUM**: 2-3 sources, or strong in one category only
- **LOW**: 1-2 sources, heavily disputed, or channeled-only

**V4 NOTE:** For low-consensus or single-source-type characteristics (e.g., channeled-only, single ancient myth), 2 sources minimum is acceptable. The 3-5 sources target applies primarily to high and medium consensus traits.

## ANCIENT SUPPORT LEVELS

Separate from consensus - indicates historical depth:

- **HIGH**: Explicit references in ancient texts (e.g., Egyptian Sopdet)
- **MEDIUM**: Inferred connections to ancient deities/myths
- **LOW**: Symbolic resonance only
- **UNKNOWN**: No ancient references found

✅ Each characteristic has 3-5 sources (target); 2 sources minimum acceptable for low-consensus traits
✅ All sources have ISBN or DOI
✅ All sources have either (location_hint + summary) OR (page + quote)
✅ All sources have `citation_status: "provisional"` or `citation_status: "locked"`
✅ Ancient sources include translator/editor attribution
✅ **All sources specify astronomical component (A|B|C|unspecified) with reasoning**
✅ **Ancient sources (pre-1862) = Component A**
✅ **Dogon/Temple material = Component B if discussing po tolo/binary**
✅ **Channeled "Sirius system" without stellar detail = unspecified**

✅ **NO `verified: true` field** (added during manual verification)

## RESEARCH STRATEGY

1. **Start with ancient sources** - Egyptian Sopdet/Sothis is solid ground (ALL Component A)
   - Check Archive.org for Faulkner, Mercer translations (LOCKED citations possible)
   - Check sacred-texts.com for Avestan texts (LOCKED citations possible)
2. **Add Law of One** - Fully accessible at lawofone.info (LOCKED citations possible)
3. **Add indigenous traditions** - Dogon (with disputes noted, likely PROVISIONAL)
4. **Include modern esoteric** - Temple, Cori, Bailey (likely PROVISIONAL unless on Archive.org)
5. **Cross-reference** - Look for consensus patterns
6. **Document disputes** - Especially Dogon controversy (van Beek counter-evidence)
7. **Note gaps** - What's missing or unclear?

## EXPECTED CHARACTERISTICS

Based on preliminary research, expect to find evidence for:
- Teacher/guardian archetype (likely HIGH consensus, mix of LOCKED and PROVISIONAL)
- Connection to Egyptian Isis/Osiris (likely HIGH ancient support, LOCKED citations from Faulkner)
- Wisdom keeper role (likely MEDIUM-HIGH consensus)
- Genetic engineering claims (likely LOW consensus, DISPUTED, mix of PROVISIONAL and LOCKED)
- Spiritual initiation themes (likely MEDIUM consensus)

If you find characteristics NOT in this list, include them with full citations.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 MANDATORY SIRIUS-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**You MUST include these two characteristics as separate traits. Do NOT fold them into other characteristics.**

### MANDATORY #1: Isis–Sothis–Osiris Initiation / Royal Resurrection

**You MUST include a characteristic for the Isis–Sothis–Osiris initiation / royal resurrection theme.**

This is one of the strongest and most ancient pieces of Sirius lore:
- Sirius = Sothis / Sopdet
- Sopdet is identified with Isis
- Isis revives Osiris and anoints the king
- The king resurrects / ascends / becomes divine
- Tied to heliacal rising of Sirius and start of Egyptian New Year

**Required sources:**
- Faulkner's Pyramid Texts (Utterance 632, Utterance 366)
- Faulkner's Coffin Texts (Spell 213, Spell 467)
- Faulkner's Book of the Dead (Spell 148)
- Saleh 2021 academic paper on Goddess Sopdet

**Trait name examples:**
- "Initiatory royal resurrection via Isis/Sothis/Osiris"
- "Royal anointing and resurrection through Isis-Sothis alignment"
- "Pharaonic initiation and divine kingship (Isis-Sothis-Osiris)"

**This MUST be its own trait, not folded into fertility, water, or teacher characteristics.**

### MANDATORY #2: Path to Sirius / Cosmic Freedom Current

**You MUST include a characteristic summarizing the 'Path to Sirius' / 'cosmic freedom' / initiation current from Alice A. Bailey.**

This is the esoteric initiation current:
- Sirius as the place advanced souls 'graduate' to
- Path to Sirius = liberation / cosmic freedom / high initiation
- Leo Full Moon → Sirius → "principle of cosmic Freedom"
- Sirius as headquarters of spiritual Hierarchy

**Required sources:**
- Bailey's "A Treatise on Cosmic Fire" (Path IV description, pages 723-726)
- Bailey's "Esoteric Astrology" (Leo and Sirius chapter, pages 300-305)
- Blavatsky's "The Secret Doctrine" (Sirius as Great Instructor)

**Trait name examples:**
- "Path to Sirius as cosmic freedom/liberation current"
- "Source of cosmic freedom and spiritual liberation"
- "Advanced initiation path and cosmic consciousness gateway"

**This MUST be its own trait, not merged into 'teacher' or 'guardian' characteristics.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## FINAL REMINDER

**DO NOT give up and return empty results.** The v1 Sirius baseline successfully found sources. You can do the same or better.

**If you cannot fully satisfy a field under LOCKED mode, fall back to PROVISIONAL mode instead of omitting the source.** If you cannot produce `page` + `quote` for a relevant source, you MUST still include that source as `citation_status: "provisional"` with `location_hint` + `summary`. Do NOT omit the source.

**Prioritize LOCKED citations from:**
- Archive.org (ancient texts, older books)
- Sacred-texts.com (religious texts)
- Lawofone.info (Ra Material sessions)
- Google Books full previews

**Use PROVISIONAL citations for:**
- Books behind paywalls
- Recent publications not on Archive.org
- Sources you can identify but can't fully access

**Remember:** Canonical units like utterance numbers, spell numbers, and session numbers count as LOCKED citations. You don't need physical page numbers for ancient texts or channeled sessions if you have the canonical reference.

**Minimum acceptable response: 3-5 characteristics, each with 2-5 fully cited sources (mix of provisional and locked), mixing ancient and modern, with disputes noted, astronomical components specified, and citation status marked. Low-consensus traits may have 2 sources minimum.**

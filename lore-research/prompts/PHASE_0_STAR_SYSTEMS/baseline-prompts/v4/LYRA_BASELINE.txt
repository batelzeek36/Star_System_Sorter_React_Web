# LYRA BASELINE RESEARCH (V4)

## CONTEXT
You are conducting Phase 0 baseline research for the Star System Sorter project. This research establishes the foundational characteristics of Lyra that will later be used to map Human Design gates to star systems. Academic rigor and proper citations are CRITICAL.

**V4 PHILOSOPHY:** This version uses honest field naming to distinguish provisional research (location hints + summaries) from locked citations (exact pages + verbatim quotes). You provide the research scaffold, the human locks it down later.

**V4 IMPROVEMENTS:**
1. Relaxed trait coverage rule for low-consensus characteristics
2. Optimized handling of fully accessible online sources (sacred-texts.com, archive.org)
3. Clarified translator full name expectations

🔥 V4 CITATION POLICY: PROVISIONAL vs LOCKED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Citation Status Types

### PROVISIONAL (when you can't access full text)
Use when you've identified a legitimate source but can't access the complete text:

**Required fields:**
- `location_hint` - Chapter, section, verse/line reference
- `summary` - ≤25 word paraphrase of what source says about the trait
- `citation_status: "provisional"`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "title": "The Prism of Lyra: An Exploration of Human Galactic Heritage",
  "author": "Lyssa Royal Holt",
  "edition": "First Edition",
  "year": 1989,
  "publisher": "Royal Priest Research Press",
  "location_hint": "Chapter 3, pp. 45-52",
  "summary": "Lyrans as primordial humanoid root race and builders of early galactic civilizations",
  "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1234567.The_Prism_of_Lyra",
  "isbn": "ISBN 1-891824-87-6",
  "source_type": "channeled",
  "citation_status": "provisional"
}
```

### LOCKED (when you have verbatim access)
Use when you can copy exact text from a source you can fully access:

**Required fields:**
- `page` - Exact locator in the cited edition. This MAY be a physical page number OR an internal canonical unit (e.g., "Book X, lines 110-114"). Canonical units are acceptable as LOCKED citations.
- `quote` - Verbatim text ≤25 words from source
- `citation_status: "locked"`

**Example (ancient text with canonical reference):**
```json
{
  "title": "Metamorphoses",
  "author": "Ovid",
  "translator_or_editor": "A. D. Melville (translator)",
  "edition": "Oxford World's Classics",
  "year": 1986,
  "original_year": 8,
  "publisher": "Oxford University Press",
  "page": "Book X, lines 145-154",
  "quote": "Orpheus with his lyre charmed all nature, and upon his death the lyre was placed among the stars",
  "url": "https://archive.org/details/metamorphoses-ovid",
  "isbn": "ISBN 0-19-283472-X",
  "source_type": "ancient",
  "citation_status": "locked"
}
```

**Example (modern channeled book):**
```json
{
  "title": "The Prism of Lyra: An Exploration of Human Galactic Heritage",
  "author": "Lyssa Royal Holt",
  "edition": "First Edition",
  "year": 1989,

  "quote": "The Lyran civilization represents the first humanoid template in this galactic sector",
  "url": "URL IF AVAILABLE",
  "isbn": "ISBN 1-891824-87-6",
  "source_type": "channeled",
  "citation_status": "locked"
}
```

## What You MAY Do

✅ **PROVISIONAL citations when:**
- Full text is behind paywall
- Only preview pages available on Google Books
- Source exists but you can't access complete text
- You can identify chapter/section but not exact page

✅ **LOCKED citations when:**
- Source is fully accessible on Archive.org (full text, not just table of contents)
- Source is on sacred-texts.com with full text
- Google Books has full preview available
- You can copy verbatim text

**CRITICAL:** If a source is fully available at sacred-texts.com, archive.org, or poetryintranslation.com with complete searchable text, you MUST treat it as `citation_status: "locked"` and include a `quote` + canonical locator. Do NOT use provisional mode for fully accessible sources.

## What You MAY NOT Do

❌ **NEVER:**
- Fabricate page numbers or quotes
- Label a paraphrase as a direct quote
- Use `citation_status: locked` unless quote is truly verbatim
- Use placeholder quotes like "[EXAMPLE QUOTE]"
- Guess at page numbers
- Use Wikipedia or blogs as sources
- Use anonymous authors like "Various sources", "Multiple authors", "Contemporary sources"
- Cite Bashar material without a published book ISBN (blog transcripts are forbidden)
- Use blog URLs (curiouspunk.com, victoriamargaux.com, mysticknowing.com, weebly.com, etc.)
- Include traits that can only be sourced to blogs - DROP THE TRAIT instead
- Give up and return empty results

## Field Usage Rules

**Use `location_hint` + `summary` when:**
- You know the source exists (verified ISBN, author, edition)
- You can identify approximate location (chapter, section)
- You can't access full text for verbatim quote
- Set `citation_status: "provisional"`

**Use `page` + `quote` when:**
- You have full text access
- You can copy exact words from source
- You can verify exact page/book/line number
- Set `citation_status: "locked"`

**DO NOT include `verified: true` field** - that will be added during manual verification phase

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## OBJECTIVE
Research and document the characteristics attributed to LYRA across ancient Greek mythology (constellation origin) and modern channeled/esoteric texts (Lyran race narrative). Return findings as minified JSON with complete citations.

**Note:** Ancient support expected to be LOW/UNKNOWN for "Lyran race" characteristics. Greek mythology provides constellation origin only (Orpheus' lyre).

## ACADEMIC CONTEXT

This research supports Star System Sorter, which maps Human Design's I Ching-based gate system to star mythology.

**Human Design's Academic Foundations:**
- **I Ching (64 hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement (Wilhelm translation, 1950)
- **64 DNA codons** - Nobel Prize research (Nirenberg & Khorana, 1968)
- **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Extensive academic study (Scholem, Idel)
- **Chakra system** - Religious Studies, Yoga Studies (Feuerstein)
- **Western Astrology** - Cultural/historical phenomenon (Tarnas)

**Mathematical Correspondences:**
- 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (verifiable fact)
- Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)

**Your Task:** Document Lyra characteristics using rigorous sourcing standards (ancient texts, published books, proper citations). This is **comparative mythology research**, not pseudoscience.

**CRITICAL:** If you cannot find an ISBN for a pre-1967 or pre-ISBN edition, set `"isbn": null` and STILL RETURN THE SOURCE. Do not omit the source.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
Based on preliminary research, Lyra is associated with:
- Primordial humanoid root race (modern channeled material)
- Feline (or avian) ancestry - sources disagree
- Builders of early galactic civilizations
- Refugees after war with Draco
- Carry "first template" consciousness
- Greek mythology: Orpheus' lyre constellation origin

Your task is to find evidence that confirms, refutes, or nuances these characteristics.

## PRIMARY SOURCES TO RESEARCH

### Modern Channeled Material (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **"The Prism of Lyra"** by Lyssa Royal Holt (1989, ISBN 1-891824-87-6) - PRIMARY SOURCE
- **"Visitors from Within"** by Lyssa Royal & Keith Priest (1992)
- **"The Three Waves of Volunteers"** by Dolores Cannon (2011, ISBN 978-1-886940-18-1)
- **"Bringers of the Dawn"** by Barbara Marciniak (1992, ISBN 0-939680-98-5) - Lyran progenitor references
- **"Your First Contact"** by Sheldan Nidle (2000, ISBN 0-9680271-2-7)
- **Bashar material** (Darryl Anka) - ONLY cite if you have published book with ISBN, NOT blog transcripts

**Note:** "The Prism of Lyra" has multiple printings/ISBNs in circulation (1989, 1993, various ISBNs). DO NOT GUESS the year/ISBN. Use the year/ISBN actually present in the specific scan or edition you are citing.

**CRITICAL:** For feline/avian physical form claims, you MUST use ISBN-backed sources:
- Feline: Lyssa Royal Holt "The Prism of Lyra" (1989)
- Humanoid progenitor: Barbara Marciniak "Bringers of the Dawn" (1992)
- If you cannot find ISBN-backed sources for avian claims, DROP the avian trait entirely rather than cite blogs

### Ancient Greek Mythology (HIGH PRIORITY - Often fully accessible)
- **Ovid**: "Metamorphoses" (Orpheus story) - poetryintranslation.com or archive.org
- **Apollodorus**: "Bibliotheca" (Library of Greek Mythology)
- **Hyginus**: "Astronomica" (constellation myths) - Use Mary Grant translation or Theony Condos edition
- **Pseudo-Eratosthenes**: "Catasterismi" - Use Theony Condos "Star Myths of the Greeks and Romans" (Phanes Press, 1997, ISBN 0-933999-79-6) NOT "Unknown translator"
- **Orphic Hymns**: Various translations on sacred-texts.com

### Theosophical/Root Race Theory
- **Helena Blavatsky**: "The Secret Doctrine" (1888) - archive.org
- **Root race theories**: Lemurian connections

### Scholarly Works on Greek Mythology
- **Robert Graves**: "The Greek Myths" (1955, ISBN 0-14-001026-2)
- **Edith Hamilton**: "Mythology" (1942, ISBN 0-316-34114-2) - DO NOT use weebly/blog URLs, cite book only
- **Karl Kerényi**: "The Gods of the Greeks" (1951)

## SPECIAL FOCUS: Feline vs Avian vs Humanoid Confusion

Sources disagree on Lyran physical form:
- Some sources describe feline beings
- Others describe avian or bird-like features
- Still others describe humanoid with no animal features
- Document all variations, note inconsistencies in `form_inconsistencies` field

## SPECIAL FOCUS: Ancient vs Modern Disconnect

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**
- **Ancient Greek sources**: Lyra constellation origin (Orpheus' lyre placed in sky)
- **Modern channeled sources**: Lyran race as primordial humanoids
- **NO CONNECTION** between ancient constellation myth and modern ET narrative

Document this clearly in `research_notes`.

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT assume Lyra = Vega or Lyra = Pleiades. Only assert migration narratives (e.g. "Lyran refugees to Pleiades after Draco conflict") if a cited source explicitly states it. Otherwise leave it out. These are separate star systems in the S³ classification system.

## CITATION REQUIREMENTS

Every source MUST include:

**ALWAYS REQUIRED (both provisional and locked):**
1. **Full title** (exact, not abbreviated)
2. **Author name(s)** (full names preferred; initials acceptable if that's how the translator is commonly cited in academic literature. NEVER use "Various sources", "Multiple authors", "Contemporary sources", or other anonymous attributions)
3. **Translator/Editor** (for ancient/Greek sources - MUST include translator name with "(translator)" designation. Example: "A. D. Melville (translator)" or "Theony Condos (translator)". For modern/channeled sources, omit translator_or_editor entirely unless the book actually has a translator/editor.)
4. **Edition information** (e.g., "First Edition", "Oxford World's Classics")
5. **Publication year** (original and edition if different)
6. **Publisher/imprint** (e.g., "Oxford University Press", "Royal Priest Research Press")
7. **URL** (if available online - archive.org, publisher, academic database. NEVER use blog URLs: curiouspunk.com, victoriamargaux.com, mysticknowing.com, weebly.com, channeledstuff.ueuo.com, or similar)
8. **ISBN or DOI** (required for verification. If neither exists for pre-1967 publications or ancient translations, use `"isbn": null` and ensure publisher is specified)
9. **Source type** (ancient|research|channeled|indigenous|controversial)
10. **Citation status** (provisional|locked)

**FOR PROVISIONAL citations:**
11. **location_hint** - Chapter, section, book/line reference
12. **summary** - ≤25 word paraphrase of what source says

**FOR LOCKED citations:**
11. **page** - Exact locator in the cited edition. This MAY be a physical page number OR an internal canonical unit (e.g., "Book X, lines 110-114"). Canonical units are acceptable as LOCKED citations.
12. **quote** - Verbatim text ≤25 words from source

## CONSENSUS LEVELS

Assign based on evidence quality:

- **HIGH**: 3+ independent sources, cross-cultural validation, minimal disputes
- **MEDIUM**: 2-3 sources, or strong in one category only
- **LOW**: 1-2 sources, heavily disputed, or channeled-only

**V4 NOTE:** For low-consensus or single-source-type characteristics (e.g., channeled-only), 2 sources minimum is acceptable. The 3-5 sources target applies primarily to high and medium consensus traits.

## ANCIENT SUPPORT LEVELS

Separate from consensus - indicates historical depth:

- **HIGH**: Explicit references in ancient texts (e.g., Greek constellation myths)
- **MEDIUM**: Inferred connections to ancient deities/myths
- **LOW**: Symbolic resonance only
- **UNKNOWN**: No ancient references found (expected for "Lyran race" characteristics)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your response MUST be:
1. Valid JSON only (no narrative text, no explanations, no markdown code blocks)
2. MINIFIED (single line, no whitespace, no line breaks, no indentation)
3. Start with { and end with }
4. Nothing else before or after the JSON

**WRONG:** ```json\n{\n  "star_system": "Lyra",\n  ...
**RIGHT:** {"star_system":"Lyra","version":"4.0",...}

## ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES TO WIKIPEDIA FOR DISPUTED_POINTS

**If you're tempted to use Wikipedia for counter-evidence, use these academic sources instead:**

### For Theosophical/Root Race Critiques:
- **K. Paul Johnson** - "The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and the Myth of the Great White Lodge" (SUNY Press, 1994, ISBN 0-7914-2063-9) - Academic critique arguing Blavatsky's root races refer to Earth history, not extraterrestrial Lyra
- **Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke** - "The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction" (Oxford, 2008, ISBN 978-0-19-532099-2) - Scholarly analysis of Theosophy
- **James A. Santucci** - Academic papers on Theosophy in peer-reviewed journals

### For Channeled Material Critiques:
- **Joscelyn Godwin** - "The Theosophical Enlightenment" (SUNY Press, 1994, ISBN 0-7914-2151-1)
- **Wouter J. Hanegraaff** - "New Age Religion and Western Culture" (Brill, 1996, ISBN 90-04-10696-0)

### For UFO/ET Narrative Critiques:

- **Diana Walsh Pasulka** - "American Cosmic: UFOs, Religion, Technology" (Oxford, 2019, ISBN 978-0-19-069288-0)

### For Greek Mythology Sources:
- **Use Theony Condos** - "Star Myths of the Greeks and Romans: A Sourcebook" (Phanes Press, 1997, ISBN 0-933999-79-6) for Eratosthenes/Hyginus
- **NOT "Unknown translator"** or "Various medieval manuscripts"

**CRITICAL:** If you cannot access these books, use PROVISIONAL citations with location_hint + summary. DO NOT use Wikipedia as a substitute. DO NOT use anonymous authors.

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before submitting, verify:

✅ Each characteristic has 3-5 sources (target); 2 sources minimum acceptable for low-consensus traits
✅ All sources have ISBN or DOI (or null with publisher specified)
✅ All sources have either (location_hint + summary) OR (page + quote)
✅ All sources have `citation_status: "provisional"` or `citation_status: "locked"`
✅ Ancient sources include translator/editor attribution
✅ URLs included where available
✅ Source types are labeled
✅ Consensus levels are justified
✅ Ancient support levels are noted
✅ Feline vs avian vs humanoid inconsistencies documented
✅ Ancient vs modern disconnect documented
✅ Mix of Greek mythology and channeled sources
✅ **NO `verified: true` field** (added during manual verification)

## RESEARCH STRATEGY

1. **Start with Greek mythology** - Orpheus' lyre constellation origin (LOCKED on sacred-texts.com or poetryintranslation.com)
   - Check poetryintranslation.com for Ovid Metamorphoses (LOCKED citations possible)
   - Use Hyginus Astronomica (Mary Grant translation) for LOCKED citations
   - Use Theony Condos "Star Myths of the Greeks and Romans" (1997) for Eratosthenes, NOT "Unknown translator"
2. **Add modern channeled material** - Lyssa Royal Holt "Prism of Lyra" (likely PROVISIONAL unless on Archive.org)
3. **Include other channeled sources** - Dolores Cannon, Barbara Marciniak, Sheldan Nidle (likely PROVISIONAL)
   - **DO NOT cite Bashar unless you have published book with ISBN**
   - **DO NOT use blog transcripts of channeled sessions**
4. **Add theosophical sources** - Blavatsky "Secret Doctrine" (LOCKED on archive.org)
5. **Include scholarly mythology** - Graves, Hamilton, Kerényi (likely mix)
   - **DO NOT use weebly or blog URLs for Hamilton - cite book only**
6. **Document form inconsistencies** - Feline vs avian vs humanoid across sources
   - **If you cannot find ISBN sources for avian claims, DROP the avian trait**
7. **Document ancient vs modern disconnect** - Constellation myth ≠ ET narrative

**CRITICAL RULE:** If a characteristic can ONLY be sourced to blogs, starseed websites, or anonymous "Various sources", DO NOT include that characteristic. Drop it entirely rather than violate source quality standards.

## EXPECTED CHARACTERISTICS

Based on preliminary research, expect to find evidence for:
- Orpheus' lyre constellation origin (likely HIGH consensus, HIGH ancient support, LOCKED)
- Primordial humanoid root race (likely MEDIUM consensus, UNKNOWN ancient support, PROVISIONAL)
- Feline or avian ancestry (likely LOW consensus, disputed, UNKNOWN ancient support)
- Builders of early civilizations (likely MEDIUM consensus, UNKNOWN ancient support, PROVISIONAL)
- Lyran-Draco war refugees (likely LOW consensus, UNKNOWN ancient support, PROVISIONAL)
- "First template" consciousness (likely LOW consensus, channeled-only, PROVISIONAL)

If you find characteristics NOT in this list, include them with full citations.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 MANDATORY LYRA-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**You MUST include these characteristics as separate traits. Do NOT fold them into other characteristics.**

### MANDATORY #1: Orpheus' Lyre Constellation Origin

**You MUST include a characteristic documenting the Greek mythological origin of the Lyra constellation.**

This is the only ancient support for Lyra:
- Ovid's Metamorphoses: Orpheus' lyre placed among the stars
- Apollodorus' Bibliotheca: Orpheus myth
- Hyginus' Poetica Astronomica: Constellation catalogues
- Orphic hymns and traditions

**Required sources:**
- Ovid "Metamorphoses" (Melville or other translation) - Orpheus story
- Apollodorus "Bibliotheca" or Hyginus "Poetica Astronomica" - constellation myth
- At least one modern scholarly source on Greek mythology (Graves, Hamilton, or similar)

**This characteristic MUST have ≥2 sources (at least one ancient LOCKED, at least one scholarly/modern).**

**Trait name examples:**
- "Orpheus' lyre constellation origin in Greek mythology"
- "Lyra as celestial lyre of Orpheus"
- "Musical and artistic associations from Orpheus myth"

**This MUST be its own trait with ancient Greek validation documented.**

### MANDATORY #2: Primordial Humanoid Root Race (Modern Channeled)

**You MUST include a characteristic for the primordial root race theme from modern channeled material.**

This is the primary Lyra archetype in esoteric literature:
- Lyssa Royal Holt "The Prism of Lyra" (1989) - PRIMARY SOURCE
- First humanoid template in galactic history
- Builders of early civilizations
- Progenitors of other star races

**Required sources:**
- Lyssa Royal Holt "The Prism of Lyra" (1989, ISBN 1-891824-87-6)
- At least one other channeled source (Dolores Cannon, Bashar, or similar)
- Note: Ancient support = UNKNOWN (modern channeled material only)

**This characteristic MUST have ≥2 sources (both modern channeled material).**

**Trait name examples:**
- "Primordial humanoid root race and galactic progenitors"
- "First humanoid template in galactic history"
- "Builders of early galactic civilizations"

**This MUST be its own trait, clearly marked as modern channeled material with no ancient support.**

### MANDATORY #3: Feline/Avian Physical Form Controversy

**You MUST include a characteristic documenting the disagreement about Lyran physical form.**

Sources disagree on whether Lyrans are:
- Feline beings (cat-like features)
- Avian beings (bird-like features)
- Humanoid with no animal features

**Required sources (ALL must have ISBNs):**
- Feline: Lyssa Royal Holt "The Prism of Lyra" (1989, ISBN 1-891824-87-6)
- Humanoid: Barbara Marciniak "Bringers of the Dawn" (1992, ISBN 0-939680-98-5)
- Avian: ONLY include if you can find ISBN-backed source (Sheldan Nidle or Ashayana Deane books)
- Document the inconsistency in `form_inconsistencies` field

**This characteristic MUST have ≥2 sources showing the disagreement (one feline, one humanoid).**

**CRITICAL:** If you cannot find ISBN-backed sources for avian claims, document feline vs humanoid only. DO NOT cite blogs or "Various sources" for this trait.

**Trait name examples:**
- "Feline ancestry and cat-like physical features (disputed)"
- "Physical form controversy: feline vs humanoid"
- "Varied descriptions of Lyran appearance across sources"

**This MUST be its own trait OR documented in disputed_points section with sources for each claim.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## TRAIT INCLUSION DECISION TREE

**Before including ANY characteristic, ask:**

1. **Can I find ≥2 sources with ISBNs and named authors?**
   - YES → Include the trait with PROVISIONAL or LOCKED citations
   - NO → Go to step 2

2. **Are the only sources I can find blogs, "Various sources", or anonymous?**
   - YES → **DROP THE TRAIT ENTIRELY**. Do not include it.
   - NO → Go to step 3

3. **Can I find 1 ISBN source + 1 academic/ancient source?**
   - YES → Include the trait, mark consensus as LOW
   - NO → **DROP THE TRAIT ENTIRELY**

**Examples of traits to DROP if only blog-sourced:**
- "Avian or bird-like physical characteristics" (if no ISBN sources found)
- Any trait sourced only to curiouspunk.com, victoriamargaux.com, mysticknowing.com
- Any trait sourced only to "Various starseed literature" or "Contemporary sources"

**Better to have 5-6 well-sourced characteristics than 8-9 characteristics with blog contamination.**

## FINAL REMINDER

**DO NOT give up and return empty results.** Ancient Greek sources for Lyra constellation are widely available online. Modern channeled sources exist as published books.

**If you cannot fully satisfy a field under LOCKED mode, fall back to PROVISIONAL mode instead of omitting the source.** If you cannot produce `page` + `quote` for a relevant source, you MUST still include that source as `citation_status: "provisional"` with `location_hint` + `summary`. Do NOT omit the source.

**However, if you cannot find ISBN-backed sources for a trait, DROP THE TRAIT rather than cite blogs.**

**Prioritize LOCKED citations from:**
- Poetryintranslation.com (Ovid Metamorphoses, Greek texts)
- Sacred-texts.com (Apollodorus, Hyginus, Orphic hymns)
- Archive.org (Blavatsky, Graves, Hamilton)

**Use PROVISIONAL citations for:**
- Modern channeled books (Lyssa Royal Holt, Dolores Cannon) unless on Archive.org
- Recent esoteric publications
- Sources behind paywalls

**Remember:** Canonical units like "Book X, lines 110-114" count as LOCKED citations. You don't need physical page numbers for ancient texts if you have the canonical reference.

**Minimum acceptable response: 5-7 characteristics (including 3 mandatory), each with 2-5 fully cited sources (mix of provisional and locked), with form inconsistencies and ancient vs modern disconnect documented, and citation status marked.**

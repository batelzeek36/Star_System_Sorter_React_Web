# ANDROMEDA BASELINE RESEARCH (V4)

## CONTEXT

You are conducting Phase 0 baseline research for the Star System Sorter project. This research establishes the foundational characteristics of Andromeda that will later be used to map Human Design gates to star systems. Academic rigor and proper citations are CRITICAL.

**IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY SCOPE FOR THIS TASK:**

* "Andromeda" may refer to:

  * The **Andromeda Galaxy (M31)** in modern astronomy
  * The **constellation Andromeda** (rooted in Greco-Roman myth of Princess Andromeda)
  * "Andromedans" / "Andromedan Council" / "Andromedan beings" in modern esoteric and channeled sources
* You MUST capture all three. You MUST NOT collapse them into one undifferentiated blob. Treat them as potentially related or unrelated lineages and mark consensus honestly.

**V4 PHILOSOPHY:** This version uses honest field naming to distinguish provisional research (location hints + summaries) from locked citations (exact pages + verbatim quotes). You provide the research scaffold, the human locks it down later.

**V4 IMPROVEMENTS:**

1. Relaxed trait coverage rule for low-consensus characteristics
2. Optimized handling of fully accessible online sources (sacred-texts.com, archive.org)
3. Clarified translator full name expectations

**Required fields:**

* `location_hint` - Chapter, section, session number, etc.
* `summary` - ≤25 word paraphrase of what source says about the trait
* `citation_status: "provisional"`

**Example:**

```json

```

## What You MAY Do

✅ **PROVISIONAL citations when:**

* Full text is behind paywall
* Only preview pages available on Google Books
* Source exists but you can't access complete text
* You can identify chapter/section but not exact page

✅ **LOCKED citations when:**

* Source is fully accessible on Archive.org (full text, not just table of contents)
* Source is on sacred-texts.com with full text
* Public-domain scans of historical astronomy papers
* Google Books has full preview available
* You can copy verbatim text

**CRITICAL:** If a source is fully available at archive.org, sacred-texts.com, HathiTrust full view, or similar full-scan archive, you MUST treat it as `citation_status: "locked"` and include a `quote` + locator. Do NOT use provisional mode for fully accessible sources.

## What You MAY NOT Do

❌ **NEVER:**

* Fabricate page numbers or quotes
* Label a paraphrase as a direct quote
* Use `citation_status: locked` unless the quote is truly verbatim
* Use placeholder quotes like "[EXAMPLE QUOTE]"
* Guess at page numbers
* Use Wikipedia or blogs as sources
* Give up and return empty results

## Field Usage Rules

**Use `location_hint` + `summary` when:**

* You know the source exists (verified ISBN, DOI, author, edition)
* You can identify approximate location (chapter, section)
* You can't access full text for verbatim quote
* Set `citation_status: "provisional"`

**Use `page` + `quote` when:**

* You have full text access
* You can copy exact words from source
* You can verify exact locator
* Set `citation_status: "locked"`

**DO NOT include `verified: true` field** - that will be added during manual verification phase.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## OBJECTIVE

Research and document the characteristics attributed to ANDROMEDA across:

1. Classical/ancient myth associated with the Andromeda constellation (Princess Andromeda, Perseus rescue, royal bloodline duty)
2. Modern astronomy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31 as separate galactic civilization space)
3. Modern esoteric, contact, and channeled material about "Andromedans" (ethics, sovereignty, anti-control, evolutionary pressure toward freedom)

Return findings as **minified JSON** with complete citations.

## ACADEMIC CONTEXT

This research supports Star System Sorter, which maps Human Design's I Ching-based gate system to star mythology and cosmology.

**Human Design's Academic Foundations:**

* **I Ching (64 hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung engagement via Wilhelm/Baynes translation (1950)
* **64 DNA codons** - Nobel-recognized genetic code work (Marshall Nirenberg, Har Gobind Khorana, 1960s)
* **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Deep academic study (Gershom Scholem, Moshe Idel)
* **Chakra system** - Religious studies / Indological scholarship (Georg Feuerstein)
* **Western Astrology** - Cultural/intellectual history (Richard Tarnas)

**Mathematical Correspondences:**

* 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (documented parallel in Human Design origin literature)
* Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code model (A/T, C/G)

**Your Task:** Document Andromeda system characteristics using rigorous sourcing standards (ancient/classical myth, astronomy, published books, proper citations). This is **comparative mythology and cosmology research**, not pseudoscience.

**CRITICAL:** If you cannot find an ISBN for a pre-1967 or pre-ISBN edition, set `"isbn": null` and STILL RETURN THE SOURCE. Do not omit the source.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE

Based on preliminary research, Andromeda is associated with:

* Liberation from control systems and authoritarian empires
* High ethical governance / non-hierarchical councils
* Advanced/extragalactic origin status (not local to Milky Way)
* Rescue/deliverance archetypes (Andromeda myth: bound, then freed)
* Warnings about manipulation and timeline steering

Your task is to find evidence that confirms, refutes, or nuances these characteristics.

## PRIMARY SOURCES TO RESEARCH

### Classical / Mythic (HIGH PRIORITY for constellation-level Andromeda)

* Greek heroic cycle: Perseus, Andromeda, Cepheus, Cassiopeia
* Sources that explicitly tie Andromeda (the princess) to the **constellation** placement in the sky
* Classical compilations still in print, public-domain mythography, and star lore texts that identify Andromeda as a named constellation

### Historical & Academic Astronomy (HIGH PRIORITY for Andromeda Galaxy)

* Edwin Hubble (1920s) identifying Andromeda as extragalactic
* Historical identification of the "Andromeda Nebula" as an island universe
* Modern galactic-scale framing of Andromeda as a separate system with its own stellar population

### Modern Esoteric / Contact Literature (HIGH PRIORITY for "Andromedans")

* Alex Collier (Andromedan Council material, 1990s)
* Contact/telepathic briefings describing Andromedan socio-ethical structure, non-interference, collective sovereignty
* Other published Andromedan communications in print with ISBN (e.g. Val Valerian / Leading Edge Research imprints)

### Comparative / UFO / Metaphysical Studies

* Works that distinguish Andromedans from "Pleiadians" or "Sirians" in terms of ethos, mission profile, intervention rules, social organization
* Works that present councils, charters, accords

**NOTE:** You may include credible UFOlogy / contactee literature with ISBN (e.g. 1980s–1990s contactee publications) as "channeled" or "controversial" sources. You MUST mark them honestly as such in `source_type`.

## CITATION REQUIREMENTS

Every source MUST include:

**ALWAYS REQUIRED (both provisional and locked):**

1. **Full title** (exact, not abbreviated)
2. **Author name(s)** (full names preferred; initials acceptable if that's the standard in the academic record)
3. **Translator/Editor** (for classical/ancient myth collections and star lore translations — MUST include translator/editor with `(translator)` or `(editor)` designation when applicable)
4. **Edition information** (e.g., "Revised Edition", "Marshall Jones Company Edition", "2nd Printing", "Updated 1997 Issue")
5. **Publication year** (and original_year if different)
6. **Publisher/imprint** (Princeton University Press, Oxford University Press, University of Chicago Press, Marshall Jones Company, Inner Light Publications, etc.)
7. **URL** (if available online - archive.org, HathiTrust full view, publisher scan, etc.)
8. **ISBN or DOI** (required for verification. If neither exists for pre-1967 publications, 19th/early 20th century myth compilations, or early astronomy journals, use `"isbn": null` and ensure publisher is specified)
9. **Source type** (ancient|research|channeled|indigenous|controversial)
10. **Astronomical component** (see Andromeda component mapping below)
11. **Component reasoning** (brief explanation of why you chose that component)
12. **Citation status** (provisional|locked)

**FOR PROVISIONAL citations:**
13. **location_hint** - Chapter, section, session, lecture ID, etc.
14. **summary** - ≤25 word paraphrase of what source says

**FOR LOCKED citations:**
13. **page** - Exact locator in the cited edition OR canonical unit (e.g. "Book IV, Chapter 2", "Session 3", "pp. 128-130")
14. **quote** - Verbatim text ≤25 words from source

### ASTRONOMICAL COMPONENT INFERENCE RULES (MANDATORY FOR ANDROMEDA)

Because "Andromeda" can mean different astronomical referents, you MUST choose one of the following component tags:

**Component C (CONSTELLATION):**

* Use `astronomical_component: "C"` for references to the **constellation Andromeda** in the night sky
* Includes Greek myth of Princess Andromeda, Perseus rescuing Andromeda, royal lineage, sacrifice to the sea monster
* Includes classical star lore and pre-modern constellation naming traditions
* **Rule:** If the source is discussing the Greek mythic princess Andromeda, the chained maiden, or the constellation as understood to the naked eye → Component C

**Component G (GALACTIC / M31):**

* Use `astronomical_component: "G"` for references to the **Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31)** as a separate galaxy / "island universe" / extragalactic civilization zone
* Includes modern astronomy (Hubble 1920s and later)
* Includes any esoteric source that explicitly calls Andromeda "another galaxy" or "outside the Milky Way"
* **Rule:** If the source says Andromeda is another galaxy, an extragalactic civilization, or a governing council beyond the Milky Way → Component G

**Component U (UNSPECIFIED OR AMBIGUOUS ANDROMEDANS):**

* Use `astronomical_component: "U"` for sources that describe "Andromedans" or "Andromedan Council" without clearly saying if they are from the constellation or the galaxy
* This commonly appears in contactee / telepathic / council-transcript literature
* **Rule:** If the origin is "Andromeda" but no distinction is made → Component U

**Unspecified (RARE FALLBACK):**

* Use `astronomical_component: "unspecified"` ONLY if a source clearly references "Andromeda" as an origin but refuses to define ANY spatial context (no constellation, no galaxy, no extragalactic framing, no council identifier). Most modern sources will still give at least "galaxy" or "council" → prefer "G" or "U" over "unspecified" whenever possible.

**MANDATORY:** Every source MUST include `astronomical_component` AND a short `component_reasoning`.

## DISPUTED CLAIMS - SPECIAL HANDLING

Some claims about Andromedans (e.g. "Andromedan Council gave Earth non-interference ultimatums", "Andromedans warned of timeline manipulation") are not academically verifiable and are treated skeptically by mainstream research. You MUST include both sides:

### Supporting Evidence

* Alex Collier, "Defending Sacred Ground" (1990s)
* Other published Andromedan Council transcripts with ISBN or publisher imprint

### Counter-Evidence / Skeptical Framing

* Academic or UFOlogy critiques noting unverifiability, lack of physical evidence, or self-referential sourcing
* Comparative works that classify such material as "contactee narrative" rather than empirical astronomy

**Required handling example:**

```json
{
  "trait": "Andromedan Council warns against hierarchical planetary control",
  "consensus_level": "low",
  "disputed": true,
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "Defending Sacred Ground: The Andromedan Compendium",
      "author": "Alex Collier",
      "position": "supporting",
      "citation_status": "provisional",
      ...
    },
    {
      "title": "UFO Contactees and the Reinvention of Space Utopias",
      "author": "ACADEMIC AUTHOR NAME",
      "position": "counter-evidence",
      "citation_status": "provisional",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## CONSENSUS LEVELS

Assign based on evidence quality:

* **HIGH**: 3+ independent sources, mixing classical/mythic and modern, minimal dispute
* **MEDIUM**: 2-3 sources, or strong in one category only
* **LOW**: 1-2 sources, heavily disputed, or channeled-only

**V4 NOTE:** For low-consensus or single-source-type characteristics (e.g. purely contactee material), 2 sources minimum is acceptable. The 3-5 sources target applies mostly to medium/high consensus traits.

## ANCIENT / CLASSICAL SUPPORT LEVELS

Separate from consensus - indicates historical depth:

* **HIGH**: Explicit references in classical myth or pre-modern star lore about Andromeda (the chained maiden / sacrifice / royal daughter → constellation)
* **MEDIUM**: Inferred thematic links (rescue, cosmic justice, liberation motifs)
* **LOW**: Symbolic resonance only
* **UNKNOWN**: No classical support found

## RESEARCH STRATEGY

1. **Start with classical/constellation sources**

   * Perseus/Andromeda rescue cycle
   * Andromeda as "The Chained Woman" (constellation identity)
   * Public-domain star lore (Allen 1899) for LOCKED citations

2. **Add extragalactic astronomy**

   * Hubble (1920s) proving Andromeda is an external galaxy
   * Any modern work establishing M31 as independent galactic civilization space in speculative cosmology

3. **Add Andromedan Council material**

   * Collier and similar publications with ISBN
   * Claims about anti-control ethics, sovereignty, non-interference, warnings about Earth hierarchy

4. **Document disputes and skepticism**

   * Academic framing of contactee narratives as sociopolitical myth-making, utopian projection, unverifiable

5. **Track component mapping**

   * Constellation myth = Component C
   * Galaxy M31 = Component G
   * Ambiguous 'Andromedans' = Component U

6. **Note gaps**

   * Where there is no classical support for modern claims
   * Where 'council' narratives cannot be independently verified

## EXPECTED CHARACTERISTICS

You are strongly expected to return (at minimum) traits covering:

* Liberation-from-captivity / intervention theme (Perseus freeing Andromeda → constellation codex)
* Andromeda as extragalactic home / "separate civilization space" (M31, Hubble extragalactic proof)
* Non-hierarchical council / anti-domination ethical doctrine (Andromedan Council narratives)
* Royal sacrifice / cosmic justice imprint (Andromeda chained for Cassiopeia's offense, guilt-payment dynamic)

If you find other recurring traits with enough sources, include them with full citations.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 MANDATORY ANDROMEDA-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**You MUST include these two characteristics as separate traits. Do NOT merge them with anything else.**

### MANDATORY #1: Liberation-from-captivity archetype (Andromeda chained, then freed)

This MUST appear as its own trait. Treat it as a foundational Andromeda signature:

* Andromeda is chained to the rock, condemned
* Rescue by Perseus is framed as deliverance from unjust domination
* The constellation encodes that liberation moment in the sky
* Themes: ransom, sovereignty restitution, personal innocence vs inherited guilt

**Required sources:**

* Public-domain classical/myth compilations that explicitly tie the chained maiden to the **constellation Andromeda** (e.g. Richard Hinckley Allen, "Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning", 1899 — available on Archive.org, LOCKED ok)
* Classical myth summaries in academically published works (e.g. "The Mythology of All Races" series, 1916+, Marshall Jones Company — should be LOCKED or PROVISIONAL depending on full-text access)

**Trait name examples:**

* "Liberation from captivity and wrongful bondage"
* "Rescue of the Chained Woman / cosmic anti-bondage code"
* "Deliverance from sacrificial imprisonment"

This MUST be its own trait.

### MANDATORY #2: Andromedan Council / Sovereignty Doctrine

This MUST appear as its own trait:

* Andromedan Council framed as anti-domination, anti-manipulation, pro-collective sovereignty
* Narrative that Andromedans oppose top-down planetary control structures
* Narrative that Andromedans pressure Earth toward transparency and self-responsibility
* You MUST also mark this as DISPUTED and LOW consensus

**Required sources:**

* Alex Collier, "Defending Sacred Ground: The Andromedan Compendium" (1990s)
* At least one academically framed skeptical source treating these claims as utopian or unverifiable

**Trait name examples:**

* "Andromedan Council: anti-domination sovereignty doctrine"
* "Non-hierarchical extragalactic council ethic"
* "Andromedan oversight warning against hierarchical control"

This MUST be its own trait, distinct from "liberation-from-captivity" and distinct from "Andromeda as extragalactic origin" cosmology.

## FINAL REMINDER

**DO NOT give up and return empty results.**
If you cannot provide a LOCKED citation for a relevant source, you MUST still include that source as PROVISIONAL.
If you cannot provide a page number, you MUST still include `location_hint` + `summary`.

**LOCKED mode requires a verbatim quote and a concrete locator (page, pp. range, section, session).**
**PROVISIONAL mode requires `location_hint` + `summary`.**

**Every source MUST include:**

* `astronomical_component`
* `component_reasoning`
* `citation_status`

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT TO COMET:**
Return ONE SINGLE OBJECT as **minified JSON**. No pretty-print. No line breaks. No commentary. Only valid JSON.

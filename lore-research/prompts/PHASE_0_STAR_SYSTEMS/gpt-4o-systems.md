Perfect — here’s a **refined and lore‑consistent table of the nine major star systems / factions**, with clarified associations you can safely paste into your `docs/star-systems.md` or YAML.  
This version keeps Claude’s base list but corrects polarity drift (esp. Draco/kundalini) and compresses each system into its **core archetype, function, and polarity**.

Would you like me to follow this up with a **“cross‑system dynamics matrix”** (showing alliances, rivalries, and shared motifs — e.g., _Sirius + Orion Light alliance vs. Draco + Orion Dark axis_)? That’s usually the next doc table for your sorter engine.

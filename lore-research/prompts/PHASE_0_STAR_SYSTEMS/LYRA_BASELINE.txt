# LYRA BASELINE RESEARCH

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
1. **Blog sources** (WordPress, Medium, personal websites, starseed blogs) - UNACCEPTABLE
2. **Anonymous authors** ("Various researchers", "Contemporary sources") - UNACCEPTABLE
3. **Fabricated quotes or page numbers** - UNACCEPTABLE
4. **Paraphrases presented as direct quotes** - MUST mark as paraphrase
5. **Wrong book attribution** - VERIFY book title matches quote
6. **Social media posts** (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook) - UNACCEPTABLE
7. **YouTube videos or podcasts** - UNACCEPTABLE (unless published transcript with ISBN)
8. **Wiki-style sites without citations** - UNACCEPTABLE

✅ SOURCE HIERARCHY (Use in order of preference):

**TIER 1 - ACCEPTABLE PRIMARY SOURCES:**
1. Published books with ISBN (channeled or research)
2. Academic papers and peer-reviewed journals
3. Established ancient texts with scholarly translations
4. Documented oral traditions via anthropologists

**TIER 2 - ACCEPTABLE SECONDARY SOURCES:**
1. University/museum websites with citations
2. Established mystery school publications
3. Historical channeled works (pre-1950)

**TIER 3 - UNACCEPTABLE:**
❌ Blogs and personal websites
❌ Anonymous "contemporary researchers"
❌ Social media posts
❌ Wiki-style sites without citations
❌ YouTube videos or podcasts
❌ Starseed community websites without published books
❌ Commercial websites (jewelry, art sales, psychic services, etc.)
❌ Astrology/spiritual blogs without academic credentials
❌ Personal artist or practitioner websites

⚠️ **WIKIPEDIA & ONLINE ENCYCLOPEDIAS:**
Wikipedia, Encyclopedia.com, Britannica.com, and ALL online encyclopedia/aggregator sites are **COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN** - not as primary sources, not as secondary sources, not at all. These are lazy shortcuts. Instead:
- Find the PRIMARY SOURCE that the encyclopedia cites (the actual book, journal, or ancient text)
- Cite that source directly with full bibliographic information
- Example: Don't cite "Wikipedia article on Lyra" → Cite the actual ancient text or published book
- If an encyclopedia mentions a scholar's work, find and cite that scholar's published book or paper

**FORBIDDEN ENCYCLOPEDIA SITES (NEVER USE):**
❌ Wikipedia.org
❌ Encyclopedia.com
❌ Britannica.com / Encyclopaedia Britannica
❌ Ancient.eu / WorldHistory.org
❌ Mythopedia.com
❌ Any site with "encyclopedia", "wiki", or "pedia" in the domain

**FORBIDDEN BLOG/PERSONAL SITES (NEVER USE):**
❌ WordPress blogs (*.wordpress.com)
❌ Tripod sites (*.tripod.com)
❌ Personal domains (crystalinks, preterhuman.net, etc.)
❌ Goodreads.com (book review site, not primary source)

**ACCEPTABLE SOURCES - USE THESE:**
✅ Archive.org - Full book scans with page numbers
✅ Sacred-texts.com - Proper ancient text translations
✅ Publisher websites - Book excerpts with ISBNs
✅ Academic databases - JSTOR, academia.edu, university repositories
✅ Google Books - Preview pages with actual page numbers

This is a **lore-grade research project**, not a homework assignment. Use authoritative primary sources only.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔥 NO EXCUSES - YOU CAN DO THIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DO NOT give up and return empty results.** The Sirius and Pleiades baseline research successfully found complete citations.

**YOU MUST DO THE SAME FOR LYRA.**

**Where to find sources:**
✅ Archive.org - Full book scans with page numbers
✅ Google Books - Preview pages with quotes
✅ Publisher websites - Book excerpts and ISBNs
✅ Academic databases - JSTOR, academia.edu, university repositories

**Known sources you MUST find and cite properly:**

**Channeled/Esoteric Material (Primary for Lyra):**
1. Lyssa Royal & Keith Priest - "The Prism of Lyra" (1993, ISBN 1-891824-87-6) - PRIMARY SOURCE
2. Royal & Priest - "Visitors from Within" (1992)
3. Sheldan Nidle - "Your First Contact" (1996) - Lyran references

**Ancient Mythology (Constellation only, not "Lyran race"):**
4. Greek mythology - Orpheus' lyre (constellation origin)
5. Ovid - "Metamorphoses" (Orpheus story)

**Note:** "Lyran race" is MODERN CHANNELED MATERIAL ONLY. No ancient support. Document this clearly.

**FORBIDDEN SOURCES (DO NOT USE):**
❌ Starseed blogs without published books
❌ Anonymous channelers
❌ Wikipedia (find the primary source it cites instead)

**If you return empty characteristics or say "I cannot access books", your response will be REJECTED.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## OBJECTIVE
Research LYRA as primordial root race in esoteric and channeled texts. Note: Ancient support expected to be LOW/UNKNOWN.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Primordial humanoid root race
- Feline (or avian) ancestry
- Builders of early civilizations
- Refugees after war with Draco
- Carry "first template" consciousness

## ACADEMIC CONTEXT

This research supports Star System Sorter, which maps Human Design's I Ching-based gate system to star mythology.

**Human Design's Academic Foundations:**
- **I Ching (64 hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement (Wilhelm translation, 1950)
- **64 DNA codons** - Nobel Prize research (Nirenberg & Khorana, 1968)
- **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Extensive academic study (Scholem, Idel)
- **Chakra system** - Religious Studies, Yoga Studies (Feuerstein)
- **Western Astrology** - Cultural/historical phenomenon (Tarnas)

**Mathematical Correspondences:**
- 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (verifiable fact)
- Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)

**Your Task:** Document star system characteristics using rigorous sourcing standards (ancient texts, published books, proper citations). This is **comparative mythology research**, not pseudoscience.

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md` - 300+ verified sources.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

### Modern Channeled Material
- "The Prism of Lyra" by Lyssa Royal Holt (1989)
- "The Three Waves of Volunteers" by Dolores Cannon (2011)
- Bashar (Darryl Anka) mentions
- Starseed literature (various authors)

### Theosophical/Root Race Theory
- Helena Blavatsky "The Secret Doctrine" (1888)
- Root race theories (Lemurian connections)

### Ancient Sources
- Limited to none expected
- Greek: Lyra constellation (Orpheus's lyre)
- Note: Mythological lyre ≠ ET claims

## SPECIAL FOCUS: Feline vs Avian Confusion

Sources disagree on Lyran form:
- Some say feline beings
- Others say avian or humanoid
- Document both, note inconsistency

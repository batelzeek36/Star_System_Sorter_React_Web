Short answer: it’s strong. You’ve nailed rigor, structure, and dispute-handling. I’d tighten a few things so Comet/Pro agents don’t hallucinate, and so your output is auto-validatable and reproducible.

Here’s what I’d fix/upgrade fast:

1. ban placeholder quotes  
   Your examples currently include invented lines (e.g., Ra/Temple). Models sometimes copy examples into “real” output. Label examples explicitly as **EXAMPLE ONLY—DO NOT COPY** or remove them.
2. require translator/editor + component disambiguation  
   For ancient texts, force `translator` and (for Egyptian) `spell/utterance` or plate/tomb numbers; for Mesopotamian tablets, `tablet/line`. Add `astronomical_component: "A|B|C|unspecified"` to avoid A/B/C conflation.
3. lock an explicit JSON Schema  
   Give the model a schema so the output parses and you can enforce enums and field presence.
4. weight & thresholds made explicit  
   Define how `consensus_level` is computed (e.g., numeric weights per source_type + independence check). Prevent “HIGH” when evidence comes only from channeled/controversial sources.
5. edition/url hygiene  
   Force stable links (DOI/JSTOR/Archive.org/publisher). Disallow Wikipedia except for disambiguation and never as a citable source.
6. search protocol & abort rules  
   Add: (a) two-pass process (collect → quote-verify), (b) no inclusion without page/line, (c) abort the trait or drop consensus if <3 verified sources, (d) log gaps.
7. widen ancient scope slightly  
   Tell it to check Avestan **Tishtrya/Tir** materials (often associated with Sirius), and Egyptian **Sopdet/Sothis** via Faulkner/Allen translations rather than outdated Budge. (Don’t assert this in results—just instruct the search.)
8. normalize fields  
   Use `loc` for precise location, `quote_lang`, `quote_translator`, `source_reliability` (0–1), and `independence_id` to avoid counting derivative sources twice.

Here’s a **ready-to-run tightened prompt** you can drop into Comet/Pro. It keeps your intent but hardens validation:

```text
You are conducting Phase 0 baseline research for the Star System Sorter. Produce STRICTLY minified JSON conforming to the JSON Schema provided. Do not include explanation or markdown.

SCOPE
- Star system: Sirius (Sopdet/Sothis; cross-cultural names allowed).
- Evidence types: ancient, indigenous, research (peer-reviewed/scholarly), channeled, controversial.
- You MUST verify every citation with exact location (page/line/tablet/spell/session) and ≤25-word direct quote from the cited edition/translation.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
- Do NOT fabricate quotes or locations. If a precise location cannot be found, EXCLUDE the source.
- Provide translator/editor for ancient sources and session/Q&A for channeled sources.
- Prefer stable links (DOI, JSTOR, publisher, Archive.org). Wikipedia allowed only for disambiguation and never cited.
- Disambiguate astronomical component with astronomical_component: "A" | "B" | "C" | "unspecified".
- Independence: If two sources are derivative, assign the same independence_id and they count once for consensus.
- Consensus computation:
  * Base weights: ancient=1.0, research=0.9, indigenous=0.8, channeled=0.4, controversial=0.4
  * Sum weights across independent sources per trait.
  * consensus_level: HIGH if sum≥3.0 AND includes ≥1 ancient OR research; MEDIUM if sum≥1.6; else LOW.
  * Channeled/controversial alone may never yield HIGH.

DOGON DISPUTE HANDLING
- Include both supporting (Temple; Griaule/Dieterlen) and counter-evidence (van Beek; Sagan) with positions.
- Mark disputed=true and set consensus_level based on rubric above.

SEARCH STRATEGY (two-pass)
1) PASS A—Source discovery: List candidate sources with edition details; DROP any without page/line access.
2) PASS B—Verification: Extract ≤25-word quotes with exact loc; compute independence and consensus; assemble final JSON.
If a trait has <3 verified sources, keep it but set consensus to LOW and explain the gap in research_notes.

MINIMUM
- 3–5 characteristics (more allowed) with ≥3 verified sources each (5+ preferred).
- Disputed points with counter-evidence as separate array entries.
- research_notes summarizing gaps, strong patterns, and edition caveats (≤75 words).

```
OUTPUT
- Return one line of minified JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no comments.
```

```

If you cannot meet these constraints, return a minified JSON object with {"error":"CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION","details":"<short reason>"}.
```

Optional quick adds (nice-to-haves):

- Add `culture_tag` to each source (“Egyptian”, “Mesopotamian”, “Greek/Roman”, “Dogon”, “Aboriginal Australia”, “Avestan/Zoroastrian”, etc.) to help later filtering.
- Add `topic_tags` per source (“Sopdet/Sothis”, “Nommo”, “Isis/Osiris”, “law/maat”, “initiation”, “Christos”).
- Add `astronomy_note` when a text references heliacal rising (date/lat assumptions), so you can sanity-check calendrical claims later.

If you want, I can also produce a tiny Jest/TS validator that enforces this schema and the consensus math so your pipeline auto-fails any weak output.

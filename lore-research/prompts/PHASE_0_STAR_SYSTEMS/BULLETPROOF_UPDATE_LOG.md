# Bulletproof Enforcement Update Log
**Date:** October 24, 2024
**Purpose:** Add rigorous source quality verification to all baseline prompts

## Changes Applied

### ✅ Completed Systems

1. **SIRIUS_BASELINE.txt** - Full bulletproof with astronomical component inference
2. **PLEIADES_BASELINE.txt** - Full bulletproof enforcement
3. **LYRA_BASELINE.txt** - Full bulletproof enforcement
4. **ANDROMEDA_BASELINE.txt** - Full bulletproof enforcement
5. **ORION_LIGHT_BASELINE.txt** - Full bulletproof enforcement

6. **ORION_DARK_BASELINE.txt** - ✅ Full bulletproof enforcement
7. **ARCTURUS_BASELINE.txt** - ✅ Full bulletproof enforcement
8. **DRACO_BASELINE.txt** - ✅ Full bulletproof enforcement
9. **ZETA_RETICULI_BASELINE.txt** - ✅ Full bulletproof enforcement

### ✅ ALL SYSTEMS COMPLETE

## Bulletproof Components Added

### 1. Source Quality Verification Rules
- Acceptable vs unacceptable sources clearly defined
- 5-step verification process
- Hard rejection criteria for lazy research

### 2. Source Quality Enforcement Table
- 8-point checklist with pass/fail examples
- Red flags for lazy research
- Specific examples for each star system

### 3. Mandatory `"verified": true` Field
- Added to JSON output format
- Forces explicit verification of each source

### 4. Final Validation Checklist
- 10+ rejection criteria
- 5+ pass criteria
- Explicit warning against lazy defaults

### 5. Enhanced Quality Checklist
- Added "zero placeholder quotes" requirement
- Added "every source verified" requirement
- System-specific validation points

## Backup Location

All original files backed up to:
`lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/backups/pre-bulletproof-20251024/`

## Next Steps

Apply bulletproof template to remaining 4 systems:
- ORION_DARK
- ARCTURUS
- DRACO
- ZETA_RETICULI


## Summary of Changes

All 9 baseline prompts now include:

### 1. Source Quality Verification Rules (30+ lines)
- Clear acceptable vs unacceptable sources
- 5-step verification process before inclusion
- Explicit rejection criteria

### 2. Source Quality Enforcement Table
- 8-point checklist with examples
- Pass/fail criteria for each field
- Red flags for lazy research

### 3. Enhanced Quality Checklist
- Added `"verified": true` requirement
- Added "zero placeholder quotes" requirement
- System-specific validation points maintained

### 4. Final Validation Section (25+ lines)
- 10+ mandatory rejection criteria
- 5+ pass criteria
- Explicit warning against lazy defaults
- System-specific requirements

### 5. JSON Output Format Updates
- Added `"verified": true` field to all source objects
- Maintained all existing fields
- Clear examples with proper formatting

## Impact

**Before:** AI could use "unknown" fields, placeholder quotes, and vague references
**After:** Every source must be fully verified with specific page numbers, verbatim quotes, and complete metadata

**Rejection triggers:**
- Any "unknown" or missing page numbers
- Any placeholder quotes
- Any abbreviated titles or author names
- Any missing translator/editor for ancient texts
- More than 20% missing URLs when available
- Any blog sources or social media posts

## Testing Recommendation

Run Perplexity Comet on all 9 systems with updated prompts to verify:
1. No "unspecified" astronomical components without reasoning (Sirius only)
2. No placeholder quotes
3. No "unknown" fields
4. All sources have `"verified": true`
5. All ancient sources have translator/editor attribution

## Files Modified

1. SIRIUS_BASELINE.txt (19.5 KB) - Special astronomical component handling
2. PLEIADES_BASELINE.txt (updated)
3. LYRA_BASELINE.txt (updated)
4. ANDROMEDA_BASELINE.txt (updated)
5. ORION_LIGHT_BASELINE.txt (updated)
6. ORION_DARK_BASELINE.txt (updated)
7. ARCTURUS_BASELINE.txt (updated)
8. DRACO_BASELINE.txt (updated)
9. ZETA_RETICULI_BASELINE.txt (updated)

All backups preserved in: `backups/pre-bulletproof-20251024/`

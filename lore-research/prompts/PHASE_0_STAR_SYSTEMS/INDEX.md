## üìã The 9 Prompts (Copy-Paste Ready)

### 1. SIRIUS (Start Here - Easiest)
**File:** `SIRIUS_BASELINE.txt`  
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê Easy  
**Ancient Support:** HIGH (Egyptian Sopdet/Sothis)  
**Expected Sources:** Pyramid Texts, Law of One, Temple, Dogon tradition  
**Special Notes:** Dogon claims are disputed - include counter-evidence

### 2. PLEIADES
**File:** `PLEIADES_BASELINE.txt`  
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê Easy  
**Ancient Support:** HIGH (Seven Sisters globally)  
**Expected Sources:** Greek, Aboriginal, Cherokee, Maya, Hindu, Japanese myths + Marciniak  
**Special Notes:** Cross-cultural validation is key

### 3. ORION LIGHT
**File:** `ORION_LIGHT_BASELINE.txt`  
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium  
**Ancient Support:** HIGH (Egyptian Orion-Osiris)  
**Expected Sources:** Pyramid Texts, Bauval, Hermetic Corpus  
**Special Notes:** Distinguish Light from Dark Orion; Bauval theory is disputed

### 4. ORION DARK
**File:** `ORION_DARK_BASELINE.txt`  
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Harder  
**Ancient Support:** LOW/UNKNOWN (modern concept)  
**Expected Sources:** Law of One, Lyssa Royal, Bashar, Alex Collier  
**Special Notes:** Distinguish from Orion Light AND Draco; note shadow work themes (not just "evil")

### 5. ANDROMEDA
**File:** `ANDROMEDA_BASELINE.txt`  
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Harder  
**Ancient Support:** LOW (symbolic only)  
**Expected Sources:** Alex Collier, Lyssa Royal, Greek myth (symbolic)  
**Special Notes:** Greek myth is symbolic resonance, not direct evidence

### 6. LYRA
**File:** `LYRA_BASELINE.txt`  
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Harder  
**Ancient Support:** LOW/UNKNOWN (modern-only)  
**Expected Sources:** Lyssa Royal, Dolores Cannon, Blavatsky  
**Special Notes:** Feline vs avian inconsistency; document both

### 7. ARCTURUS
**File:** `ARCTURUS_BASELINE.txt`  
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium  
**Ancient Support:** LOW/UNKNOWN (modern-only)  
**Expected Sources:** Edgar Cayce, Milanovich, Kenyon  
**Special Notes:** Almost all channeled material; explicitly note lack of ancient support

### 8. DRACO
**File:** `DRACO_BASELINE.txt`  
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium  
**Ancient Support:** HIGH (dragon myths globally)  
**Expected Sources:** Chinese, European, Mayan dragon myths + Icke (controversial)  
**Special Notes:** Icke's reptilian theories are disputed; note East vs West duality

### 9. ZETA RETICULI
**File:** `ZETA_RETICULI_BASELINE.txt`  
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Hardest  
**Ancient Support:** NONE (not visible to naked eye)  
**Expected Sources:** Hill case (disputed), Bashar, Jacobs, Strieber  
**Special Notes:** Hill star map is disputed; include counter-evidence

## üîÑ Workflow

```
1. Copy prompt ‚Üí 2. Paste into Comet ‚Üí 3. Validate response ‚Üí 4. Save JSON ‚Üí 5. Repeat
```

## ‚úÖ Quality Standards

Every response must have:
- 3+ sources per characteristic (5+ preferred)
- Specific page numbers (not "unknown")
- Actual quotes ‚â§25 words
- Edition information
- URLs where available
- Source types labeled
- Disputed claims noted with counter-evidence

## üìÅ Where to Save Results

Save each JSON response as:
```
lore-research/research-outputs/star-systems/[name]-baseline.json
```

Example:
```
lore-research/research-outputs/star-systems/sirius-baseline.json
lore-research/research-outputs/star-systems/pleiades-baseline.json
...
```

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå Accepting "unknown" for page numbers without trying harder  
‚ùå Taking summaries instead of direct quotes  
‚ùå Missing edition information  
‚ùå Not noting disputed claims  
‚ùå All sources from one type (e.g., all channeled)  
‚ùå Skipping URLs when sources are available online  

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate

- **Per star system:** 2-3 hours
- **Total for 9:** 18-27 hours
- **Compilation:** 2-4 hours
- **Grand total:** ~20-28 hours

## üéì What You'll Learn

By the end of Phase 0, you'll have:
- Mastered academic citation standards
- Distinguished ancient from modern sources
- Identified consensus patterns across sources
- Documented disputed claims properly
- Built a defensible foundation for gate research

## üìö Reference Documents

- `QUICK_START.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `README.md` - Detailed overview
- `../CITATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` - Citation requirements
- `../BASELINE_SYNTHESIS.md` - Expected characteristics
- `../../Important!/STAR_SYSTEM_BASELINE_RESEARCH.md` - Why this matters

## üöÄ Next Steps After Phase 0

Once all 8 baselines are complete:
1. Compile into `COMPILED_BASELINES.yaml`
2. Cross-check against `BASELINE_SYNTHESIS.md`
3. Validate using `CITATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`
4. Proceed to Phase 1 (gate research with Pass A/B/C templates)

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Start with Sirius** - It's the easiest and sets the standard
- **Do 1-2 per day** - Don't burn out
- **Reject weak responses** - Re-prompt is faster than fixing later
- **Save as you go** - Don't lose work
- **Document gaps** - If sources don't exist, note that explicitly

**Ready to begin?** Open `SIRIUS_BASELINE.txt`, copy the entire contents, and paste into Perplexity Comet.

This is the foundation that makes everything else defensible. Take your time and do it right.

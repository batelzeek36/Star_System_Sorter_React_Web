## The Simple Version

### Pass A (HD/Gene Keys/I Ching)
‚úÖ **READY TO USE**  
Minor polish later (page numbers), but good enough for MVP.

### Pass B (Ancient Wisdom)
‚úÖ **READY TO USE**  
Flag Hopi/Tao Te Ching for better sources later, but good enough for MVP.

### Pass C (Star Systems)
üü® **NEEDS 10-MINUTE FIX**  
5 things to fix before using in scorer (see below).

---

## What to Fix in Pass C (Gate 1 and Future Gates)

### 1. Add `weights_hint` (REQUIRED)
**What:** Missing section that tells scorer how much weight each system should get  
**Fix:** Add after `star_system_alignments`:
```json
"weights_hint": [
  {"system_id": "lyra", "suggested_w": 5, "reason": "primordial creative source"},
  {"system_id": "andromeda", "suggested_w": 4, "reason": "sovereign freedom"},
  {"system_id": "pleiades", "suggested_w": 3, "reason": "creative emission"},
  {"system_id": "sirius", "suggested_w": 3, "reason": "initiatory consciousness"}
]
```
**Rule:** Total ‚â§15 per gate

---

### 2. Mark Disputed Claims
**What:** Dogon/Sirius claims are controversial  
**Fix:** Change `"disputed": false` to `"disputed": true` for Temple's Sirius Mystery source

---

### 3. Upgrade Weak Citations
**What:** Blog posts and Goodreads instead of actual books  
**Fix:** 
- Sirius/Temple: Use actual book pages, not blog
- Pleiades/Marciniak: Use book pages, not Goodreads quotes
- Lyra/Royal: Use book pages, not Scribd compilation

---

### 4. Lower Andromeda Confidence
**What:** Marked "high" with only web articles  
**Fix:** Change to "medium" (or add Collier's book to justify "high")

---

### 5. Consider Adding Orion
**What:** Only 4 alignments, could add 5th  
**Fix:** Add Orion Light with "low" confidence (Egyptian creative rebirth theme)

## For Future Gates (All 64)

The template is now updated, so Comet will automatically include `weights_hint` in future responses.

**You just need to check:**
- [ ] `weights_hint` totals ‚â§15
- [ ] Disputed claims marked (Dogon, Hill map, Icke reptilians)
- [ ] Book citations (not blogs)
- [ ] Confidence matches source quality (high = 3+ primary sources)

---

## Quick Reference: Confidence Levels

| Level | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|
| **high** | 3+ primary sources (books, ancient texts, channeled transcripts) |
| **medium** | 2 sources OR mix of primary + secondary |
| **low** | 1-2 sources OR mostly web articles |
| **speculative** | Inferred connections, thin evidence |

---

## Quick Reference: Source Quality

1. ü•á Ancient texts (Pyramid Texts, I Ching, Vedas)
2. ü•à Primary channeled books (Marciniak, Royal, Collier)
3. ü•â Research books (Temple, Bauval)
4. üìÑ Academic papers
5. üåê Web articles (use sparingly)
6. üìù Blog posts (avoid)

## What to Do Right Now

**Simplest path:**
1. Read `research-outputs/gate-1/FIXES_NEEDED.md`
2. Decide: Option A, B, or C above
3. If Option A: Add `weights_hint` to Gate 1 Pass C
4. Move on to Phase 0 (star system baselines)

**The template is already fixed for future gates.**

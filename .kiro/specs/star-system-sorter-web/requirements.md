# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Star System Sorter (SÂ³) is a React Web application that provides deterministic star system classification based on Human Design birth chart data. The application collects user birth information (date, time, location, timezone), retrieves Human Design data from the BodyGraph Chart API, applies a proprietary scoring algorithm, and presents users with their star system classification results. The system emphasizes privacy, deterministic results, and a cosmic-themed user experience.

**Note:** Pre-built Figma components and screens exist in the `/Figma` directory, including Button, Card, Chip, Field, AppBar, TabBar, Toast, StarSystemCrests, and screen implementations (PaywallScreen, SettingsScreen, EmptyStatesScreen). The implementation will integrate these existing UI components with the business logic from the migration package.

## Glossary

# Lore Research Tasks

Organized workflow for researching star systems and all 64 Human Design gates.

## üìã Scope

- **Phase 0:** 8 star systems (baseline characteristics)
- **Phase 1:** 64 Human Design gates (all gates, 3 passes each = 192 prompts)
- **Total:** 200 research prompts with strict citation requirements

## üìÅ Templates Location

All prompts are generated from templates in `lore-research/prompts/`:
- **Phase 0:** `PHASE_0_ALL_STAR_SYSTEMS.md` (8 star system prompts ready to use)
- **Phase 1:** `TEMPLATE_PASS_A.txt`, `TEMPLATE_PASS_B.txt`, `TEMPLATE_PASS_C.txt` (for all 64 gates)

Kiro will read these templates and generate prompts with the correct variables filled in.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Research Order

**Phase 0 (Star Systems) MUST be completed BEFORE Phase 1 (Gates)**

Why? You cannot match gates to star systems if you haven't proven what the star systems represent.

See `lore-research/Important!/RESEARCH_PHASES.md` for detailed explanation.

---

## Phase 0: Star System Baseline Research (DO THIS FIRST)

### Goal

Establish documented characteristics for all 8 star systems with 5+ sources each.

### Required Reading

**Before starting Phase 0, review:**
- `lore-research/star-systems/BASELINE_SYNTHESIS.md` - Authoritative baseline combining GPT-4o traits with GPT-5 evidence standards
- `lore-research/Important!/STAR_SYSTEM_BASELINE_RESEARCH.md` - Detailed Phase 0 guide
- `lore-research/CITATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` - Validation criteria

### Workflow

1. **Pick a star system** from checklist below
2. **Ask Kiro** to generate the baseline research prompt
   - Example: "Generate the baseline research prompt for Sirius"
   - Kiro will create a prompt with strict citation requirements from BASELINE_SYNTHESIS.md
3. **Research in Perplexity Comet**
   - Paste the prompt
   - Save JSON response to `research-outputs/star-system-[name]-baseline.json`
4. **Validate** against `BASELINE_SYNTHESIS.md` red flags and `CITATION_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`
5. **Mark complete** in checklist below

### Phase 0 Checklist

**Primary 6 Star Systems:**
- [ ] Sirius (teachers, guardians, Sirian-Christos lineage)
- [ ] Pleiades (nurturers, artists, empaths, Seven Sisters)
- [ ] Orion Light/Osirian (historians, Egyptian mystery schools, Thoth/Hermes)
- [ ] Arcturus (engineers, healers, geometric consciousness)
- [ ] Andromeda (explorers, iconoclasts, freedom, sovereignty)
- [ ] Lyra (primordial builders, feline beings, instinct)

**Additional Systems (Optional):**
- [ ] Draco (power, will, hierarchy, kundalini - disputed)
- [ ] Zeta Reticuli (analysts, experimenters, detachment)

### Success Criteria for Phase 0

‚úÖ All 6 primary systems have documented characteristics  
‚úÖ Each characteristic has 5+ sources with full citations  
‚úÖ Consensus patterns are identified  
‚úÖ Ancient + modern sources are balanced  
‚úÖ All citations have page numbers, quotes, editions, URLs

**Time Estimate:** ~20 hours (2-3 days focused work)

---

## Phase 1: Gate Research (AFTER Phase 0 Complete)

### Goal

Map 64 Human Design gates to star systems based on documented characteristics from Phase 0.

### Workflow

1. **Check progress**: `./scripts/check-progress.sh`
2. **Pick a gate** from checklist below (start with G Center gates)
3. **Ask Kiro** to generate the 3 prompts for that gate
   - Example: "Generate prompts for Gate 3"
   - Kiro will look up the archetype and create 3 prompts from templates
4. **Research in Perplexity Comet**:
   - Paste `COMET_PASS_A_GATE_X.txt` ‚Üí save JSON to `research-outputs/gate-X-pass-a.json`
   - Paste `COMET_PASS_B_GATE_X.txt` ‚Üí save JSON to `research-outputs/gate-X-pass-b.json`
   - Paste `COMET_PASS_C_GATE_X.txt` ‚Üí save JSON to `research-outputs/gate-X-pass-c.json`

## Task Templates

### Task: Generate Star System Baseline Prompt (Phase 0)

**User Action:**
```
"Generate the baseline research prompt for [STAR SYSTEM NAME]"
```

**Kiro Action:**
1. Read template from `lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_ALL_STAR_SYSTEMS.md`
2. Extract the prompt for the requested star system
3. Present it to user for pasting into Perplexity Comet

**Note:** All 8 star system prompts already exist in `lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_ALL_STAR_SYSTEMS.md`. Kiro will extract the relevant one.

### Task: Generate Gate Prompts (Phase 1)

**User Action:**
```
"Generate prompts for Gate X"
```

**Kiro Action:**
1. Look up archetype in `lore-research/GATE_ARCHETYPES.md`
2. Read templates from `lore-research/prompts/`:
   - `TEMPLATE_PASS_A.txt` (HD/Gene Keys/I Ching)
   - `TEMPLATE_PASS_B.txt` (Ancient wisdom connections)
   - `TEMPLATE_PASS_C.txt` (Star system alignments)
3. Replace variables:
   - `{{GATE_NUMBER}}` ‚Üí actual gate number
   - `{{GATE_ARCHETYPE}}` ‚Üí keywords from GATE_ARCHETYPES.md
4. Create 3 prompts and present them to user for pasting into Perplexity Comet

**Note:** Templates use strict citation requirements (page numbers, quotes, editions, URLs). All 64 gates will use these same templates with different variables.

### Task: Validate Research Output

**Steps:**
1. Check all JSON files exist
2. Run validation checklist from `COMET_RESPONSE_CHECKLIST.md`
3. Verify citations have page numbers, quotes, editions, URLs
4. If any response fails validation, re-run that pass with stricter instructions
5. Mark as validated in checklist

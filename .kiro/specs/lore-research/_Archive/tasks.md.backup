# Implementation Plan - Lore Research & Gate Mapping

> **Canon:** Gate.Line is the irreducible unit (384 total). Lines (1-6) are non-definitional background used for tone/modifiers and UI tooltips. Never concatenate "gate text + generic line text" to define a Gate.Line.

> **Academic Framing:** This is digital humanities research with rigorous sourcing. Star-system mapping is interpretive lore correlation, not scientific proof. HD's actual foundations: I Ching + Western Astrology + Kabbalah + Chakras (NOT quantum physics).

# IP Protection Filing Tasks - Star System Sorter (S¬≥)

**Goal:** Establish intellectual property protection before public launch  
**Timeline:** File Stage 1 NOW (this week), Stage 2 as research progresses  
**Total Cost:** Stage 1: FREE, Stage 2: $85 (optional)  
**Status:** üìù Ready to file Stage 1 immediately

---

## üö® IMPORTANT: You Don't Need to Finish Everything First!

**Stage 1 (FILE NOW - FREE)** protects what you have TODAY:
- ‚úÖ Prior art comparison (just a dated memo)
- ‚úÖ Evidence pack (screenshots of COMPETITOR apps, not yours)
- ‚úÖ Zenodo v1.0.0 (publish current methodology + baselines)

**Stage 2 (LATER - $85)** adds legal registration:
- Copyright for unpublished works (when ready to invest)

**Stage 3 (WHEN APP LAUNCHES)** protects the application:
- Copyright for app code
- Trademark for name
- Zenodo updates with complete research

---

## Overview

Three documents prepared to protect S¬≥ research and methodology:
1. Prior Art Comparison (REV B) - Establishes novelty
2. Zenodo Dataset Package - Public DOI with timestamp (supports versioning!)
3. Copyright Registration - Legal protection

All documents have been reviewed and corrected per GPT-5 feedback.

**Key Insight:** You're protecting the RESEARCH (methodology, prompts, baselines), not the app. The research is already valuable and worth protecting NOW.

        "notes_for_alignment": "Score Draco high (0.7–1.0) when the gate.line is about predator scanning, threat assessment, loyalty enforcement, survival through dominance hierarchy, resource hoarding, or fear-based access control at the tribal/immediate level. Score Draco shadow (0.4–0.6) when it's paranoid control, ruthless elimination of threats, greed, or coercive obedience enforcement. Give Draco ~0 when the behavior is emotional caretaking or bonding panic (that's Pleiades), empire-scale coercive control or obedience infrastructure (that's Orion-Dark—Draco is tribal, not imperial), or frequency healing (that's Arcturus). Give Draco ~0 when the line is about liberation from captivity, breaking chains, or insisting no one should be owned — that's Andromeda (freedom impulse), not Draco (territorial control). Give Draco ~0 when the line is about artistic prestige, beauty lineage, 'our blood is the original template,' or creative/aesthetic superiority — that's Lyra. Draco status is enforced through fear and loyalty, not through aesthetic refinement. When the line is 'I came here on a mission to help humanity evolve / I volunteered to incarnate to stabilize Earth,' that usually goes to Lyra (or sometimes Pleiades/Arcturus depending on tone), not Draco. Draco does not present as 'volunteer healer' or 'missioned helper'; Draco presents as 'protector/enforcer.' If the line is about soothing, feeding, holding, or co-regulating ('you're safe with me, I'll take care of you'), score Pleiades, not Draco. Draco safety is territorial enforcement, not emotional nurture. If the line is 'obey or be crushed, entire civilizations bow to us,' that's Orion-Dark, not Draco. Draco is about clan-level control, not galaxy-scale imperial logistics. For spiritual challenge language: If it's honorable trial / warrior initiation / surviving an ordeal to earn rank → Orion-Light. If it's liberation-through-teaching / cosmic law that frees slaves or dissolves domination → Sirius. Either way, score Draco ~0. If it scales to 'galactic empire, mass obedience, planetary subjugation, engineered bloodlines to rule entire civilizations', score ~0 for Draco and high for Orion-Dark. Draco does clan/den control, not interstellar fascist bureaucracy."

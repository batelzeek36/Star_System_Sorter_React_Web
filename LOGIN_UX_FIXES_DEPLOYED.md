## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Google One Tap Popup Keeps Appearing
**Problem**: The Google One Tap popup was appearing even when users were already signed in.

**Solution**: Disabled `useOneTap` when user is already authenticated.

```typescript
<GoogleLogin
  onSuccess={handleGoogleSuccess}
  onError={handleGoogleError}
  useOneTap={!isAuthenticated}  // Only show One Tap when NOT authenticated
  theme="filled_blue"
  size="large"
  text="continue_with"
  shape="rectangular"
  width="100%"
/>
```

**Result**: One Tap popup only appears for unauthenticated users.

### 2. âœ… Profile Screen Shows "Signed In As"
**Problem**: Profile screen didn't show which account the user was signed in with.

**Solution**: Added "Signed in as" section showing:
- User's email address
- User's profile picture (from Google OAuth)
- Guest account indicator (if applicable)
- Sign Out button

**Implementation**:
```typescript
{user && (
  <div className="mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-white/10">
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-1">Signed in as</p>
    <p className="text-sm text-purple-300">{user.email}</p>
    {user.isGuest && (
      <p className="text-xs text-gray-400 mt-1">(Guest Account)</p>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

**Features Added**:
- Display user's Google profile picture
- Show user's name as profile title
- Show email address under "Signed in as"
- Sign Out button with logout functionality
- Redirects to login screen after logout

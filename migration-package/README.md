# Star System Sorter - React Web Migration Package

This package contains all the essential configuration, documentation, and assets needed to rebuild Star System Sorter as a React Web application.

## Quick Start

1. Copy this entire `.migration-package/` folder to your new React Web project
2. Review `SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` for step-by-step setup
3. Copy environment variables from `.env.example` to your new project's `.env`
4. Import design tokens from `design-system/` into your Tailwind config
5. Reference API documentation in `api-docs/` for BodyGraph integration

## What's Included

- **Environment Configuration**: API keys, endpoints, and environment variables
- **Design System**: Figma tokens, colors, typography, shadows, gradients
- **API Documentation**: BodyGraph API integration guide with caching strategy
- **Business Logic**: Scoring algorithms, validation schemas, moderation rules
- **Architecture Docs**: Project structure, dependency rules, testing strategy
- **Legal/Compliance**: Disclaimers, attributions, terminology guidelines

## Key Differences for React Web

- Use standard Tailwind CSS (not NativeWind)
- Replace React Native components with HTML/React equivalents
- Use `fetch` API instead of React Native networking
- Standard React Router instead of React Navigation
- CSS animations instead of React Native Animated

## Next Steps

See `SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` for detailed migration steps.

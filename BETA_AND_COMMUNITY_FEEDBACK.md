# Beta Version & Community Feedback System

**Status:** Beta Release  
**Date:** January 2025

---

## This is a Beta Release

Star System Sorter is currently in **beta**. While we've applied rigorous scholarly standards to our lore research (see `WHY_RIGOR_MAKES_IT_MORE_MIND_BLOWING.md`), we recognize that:

1. Ancient wisdom interpretation is inherently subjective
2. New sources and perspectives emerge constantly
3. Users may have expertise we haven't accessed
4. Citations can always be improved
5. Connections can be refined

---

## Future: Community-Driven Lore

This project will evolve into a **collective work** through community feedback.

### Planned Feedback System

**Users will be able to:**
- Flag disputed information
- Suggest alternative interpretations
- Provide additional sources
- Correct citation errors
- Propose new connections

**Developer (me) will:**
- Review all submissions
- Verify sources
- Update lore database
- Credit contributors
- Maintain scholarly standards

---

## Why Community Feedback Matters

### 1. Distributed Expertise
No single researcher can know all ancient traditions. Users may have:
- Academic specializations we lack
- Cultural knowledge from lived experience
- Access to rare sources
- Language skills for original texts
- Indigenous oral tradition connections

### 2. Error Correction
Despite our rigor, mistakes happen:
- Misattributed quotes
- Incorrect page numbers
- Outdated translations
- Disputed interpretations
- Missing context

### 3. Evolving Scholarship
New discoveries emerge:
- Archaeological findings
- Newly translated texts
- Academic papers
- Cross-cultural research
- Anthropological studies

### 4. Transparency & Trust
Community feedback reinforces our commitment to:
- Honesty about limitations
- Willingness to correct errors
- Openness to new evidence
- Collaborative truth-seeking

# Beta Version & Community Feedback System

**Status:** Beta Release  
**Date:** January 2025

---

## This is a Beta Release

Star System Sorter is currently in **beta**. While we've applied rigorous scholarly standards to our lore research (see `WHY_RIGOR_MAKES_IT_MORE_MIND_BLOWING.md`), we recognize that:

1. Ancient wisdom interpretation is inherently subjective
2. New sources and perspectives emerge constantly
3. Users may have expertise we haven't accessed
4. Citations can always be improved
5. Connections can be refined

---

## Future: Community-Driven Lore

This project will evolve into a **collective work** through community feedback.

### Planned Feedback System

**Users will be able to:**

- Flag disputed information
- Suggest alternative interpretations
- Provide additional sources
- Correct citation errors
- Propose new connections

**Developer (me) will:**

- Review all submissions
- Verify sources
- Update lore database
- Credit contributors
- Maintain scholarly standards

---

## Why Community Feedback Matters

### 1. Distributed Expertise

No single researcher can know all ancient traditions. Users may have:

- Academic specializations we lack
- Cultural knowledge from lived experience
- Access to rare sources
- Language skills for original texts
- Indigenous oral tradition connections

### 2. Error Correction

Despite our rigor, mistakes happen:

- Misattributed quotes
- Incorrect page numbers
- Outdated translations
- Disputed interpretations
- Missing context

### 3. Evolving Scholarship

New discoveries emerge:

- Archaeological findings
- Newly translated texts
- Academic papers
- Cross-cultural research
- Anthropological studies

### 4. Transparency & Trust

Community feedback reinforces our commitment to:

- Honesty about limitations
- Willingness to correct errors
- Openness to new evidence
- Collaborative truth-seeking

- **Rigorous feedback form** requiring substantive case:
  - Issue type (citation error, disputed claim, missing source, etc.)

- Source verification workflow
- Batch updates to lore database
- Contributor credits system
- **Feedback to submitters:**
  - Accepted: "Your contribution improved Gate X research"
  - Needs more info: "Please provide specific page numbers"
  - Rejected: "Insufficient evidence" (with explanation)

### Phase 4: Public Changelog (Q4 2025)

- Display lore version history
- Show what changed and why
- Credit contributors
- Link to supporting sources

## Quality Standards for Community Contributions

All submissions must meet the same standards as our research:

### Required (Form Enforced):

- ✅ Named sources (no "various researchers")
- ✅ Specific citations (page numbers, editions)
- ✅ Verifiable claims (we can check them)
- ✅ Scholarly translations (not blog paraphrases)
- ✅ Detailed explanation (200+ characters)
- ✅ Clear reasoning (100+ characters on why it matters)

### Preferred:

- Ancient textual support
- Cross-cultural verification
- Academic publications
- Published books with ISBN

### Flagged for Review:

- Channeled-only sources (evaluated case-by-case)
- Blog sources (requires verification)
- Anonymous claims (needs attribution)
- Disputed theories (noted as such)

### Auto-Rejected (Saves Developer Time):

- ❌ No sources provided
- ❌ Vague descriptions ("this seems wrong")
- ❌ Personal opinions without evidence
- ❌ "I feel like..." or "I think..." without citations
- ❌ Blog-only sources without verification path
- ❌ Spam or trolling attempts

---

## Contributor Recognition

### Credit System:

- **Major Contributions:** Name in app credits + changelog
- **Minor Corrections:** Acknowledgment in changelog
- **Anonymous:** "Community contributor" credit

### Hall of Contributors (Future):

- Public list of contributors
- Number of accepted submissions
- Areas of expertise
- Optional profile links

---

## Preventing Low-Quality Submissions

### Form Design Philosophy:

**Make it easy to submit good feedback, hard to submit BS.**

### Friction Points (Intentional):

1. **Required fields** - Can't skip sources or explanations
2. **Character minimums** - Forces thoughtful responses
3. **Citation structure** - Must provide title, author, page number
4. **Preview before submit** - Shows how weak their case looks
5. **Example submissions** - Shows what good feedback looks like

### UI/UX Strategies:

- **Good example shown first:** "Here's what a helpful submission looks like"
- **Bad example shown second:** "This would be rejected (no sources)"
- **Real-time validation:** "Your explanation is too vague. Be specific."
- **Source helper:** "Need help citing? Here's the format we need."
- **Estimated review time:** "High-quality submissions reviewed within 1 week"

### Gamification (Optional):

- **Submission score preview:** "Your submission quality: 7/10"
- **Tips to improve:** "Add page numbers to increase score to 9/10"
- **Contributor level:** "Submit 3 accepted corrections to unlock 'Verified Contributor' badge"

### Rate Limiting:

- **Anonymous users:** 1 submission per day
- **Email-verified users:** 5 submissions per day
- **Verified contributors:** Unlimited (earned through accepted submissions)

## Maintaining Scholarly Integrity

### Developer Responsibilities:

1. **Verify all submissions** before accepting
2. **Maintain evidence-based standards** (no hype)
3. **Flag disputes honestly** (van Beek approach)
4. **Document reasoning** for rejections
5. **Update regularly** (quarterly minimum)

### What We Won't Accept:

- ❌ Unverifiable claims
- ❌ Anonymous sources
- ❌ Blog-only evidence
- ❌ Fabricated citations
- ❌ Dangerous misinformation

### Common BS Patterns (Auto-Flagged):

1. **"I read somewhere..."** → Rejected: Provide specific source
2. **"Everyone knows..."** → Rejected: Provide evidence
3. **"My intuition says..."** → Rejected: Not evidence-based
4. **"This YouTube video..."** → Flagged: Requires published source verification
5. **"Trust me, I'm an expert"** → Rejected: Credentials + sources required
6. **Copy-paste from Wikipedia** → Flagged: Provide original source
7. **"This is obviously wrong"** → Rejected: Explain why with evidence
8. **Personal blog as sole source** → Rejected: Requires scholarly verification

### Response Templates for Rejections:

**Insufficient Evidence:**

> "Thank you for your submission. To maintain scholarly standards, we require specific citations (author, title, page number, edition). Please resubmit with verifiable sources."

**Vague Description:**

> "Your submission lacks specific details. Please explain exactly what is incorrect and provide the correct information with supporting sources."

**Opinion Without Evidence:**

> "We appreciate your perspective, but require evidence-based submissions. Please provide scholarly sources that support your claim."

**Blog-Only Source:**

> "Blog sources require verification from published academic works. Please provide the original scholarly source the blog references."

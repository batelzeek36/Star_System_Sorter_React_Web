      "hd_title": "Confusion",
      "full_text": "When we are looking at the first line, it is called Confusion. Here is our line of introspection. Isn't it interesting that the 28.1 was called Preparation? The preparation leads to confusion. How nice.\n\nVenus exalted. The gift of penetrating to the inner meaning that ensures timely action. This is a deeply misunderstood line. This gift of penetrating to the inner meaning: there is no inner meaning here. There is, but it is lymphatic inner meaning and it will not come to you in any kind of language that your mind understands. This penetrating to the inner meaning is simply the ability to recognize that your intuition is there and operating, and let it do its job. This line can be very difficult for the people who have it. These people need to learn to see that their intuition really works. You have to figure it out in introspection. You have to see that your intuition really does work for you.\n\nThe Moon in detriment, where feelings are no substitute for clarity and can lead to indecision. Emotions. The 57 is called The Gentle and awareness can be very profound and penetrating and not so gentle. The first thing that the 57th gate knows is that its process of The Gentle is very weak. Our immune system can be overwhelmed at any given time by the emotional system. The moment that the emotions are dictating survival is the moment that there is real confusion. There is no detail at this level, which means that they are not listening, which means that they are not hearing and therefore, they will be immediately in danger.\n\nIn the white book: The possibility of the intuition penetrating to the inner meaning. That is just saying that the intuition can penetrate to the inner meaning. It is not that you get to know the inner meaning. You get the response out of the system. It knows in the moment. This is a gate of knowing.\n\nThe other side is: The possibility that confusion will overpower the intuition. If you do not rely on your intuition, if you are somebody who has a defined splenic system and you do not rely on your splenic system, it will always be overpowered. That is why first line people, in this particular case, because it is very complex with the three different connections, need to recognize that they have to begin to trust their intuition instead of saying three days later, \"I knew it.\"\n\nThe moment that you trust it, you see that it is getting to the inner meaning and then you do not have to allow these other processes to get in the way. I have a very powerful intuition and I never paid any attention to it until I went through my process. I was one of these people who would always say, \"I knew that,\" but it was always after. If you have a defined splenic system and you have the first line, this is a place where you really have to go to work and say, \"Okay, I have to let it show me that it can penetrate to the inner meaning,\" in order to learn what intuition really is.\n\nRemember, this is the beginning of the hexagram process and the first thing that it is saying to you is that people have a very hard time (this is the foundation) recognizing the power of the intuition even when they have it, because it is weak."

      "hd_title": "Cleansing",
      "full_text": "Here we come to projection. So you do not have the introspection. This line is called Cleansing. The clarity to establish proper values and ideals must be accompanied by resolute determination to maintain them. The establishment of proper values and ideals is not mental. It is not thought-out. If you have this line, your values and ideals come out intuitively. They are coming out so that you can project them outwards to the other side, to the 20, in this case.\n\nVenus exalted. Perfected cleansing through inner realization. Look at the 28.2 which is called Shaking hands with the devil. This is the potential of this line. After you have shaken hands with the devil and had your alliance, then you can come to the 57 and say, \"Okay, now I know what my proper values are supposed to be.\" Every struggle will change your morality. Somebody who will struggle with you and show you that life is of value, they may change your morality about the nature of what you thought about those people and what they are.\n\nOut of the second line, there is always a potential to project out these values and ideals, but they are not thought-out. This is why people are uncomfortable with their intuition sometimes. Those values and ideals are not a mental construct. They are coming out of you to keep you alive, after all.\n\nMoon in detriment. A superficial cleansing that tends to hide the dirt underneath the carpet. This is a very funny line, but it is so true. I know so many people who have this line and when I read this part of the line they start to giggle because that is really what they do. What is in you is in you. It is there. One of the things to recognize about the mundane level is it is all very obvious: sweeping the dirt underneath the carpet. The other level to that is not being ready to accept the values and ideals that are being projected out of your own system. In other words, having your own morality that says, \"No, no my mind says that is not right. I will sweep that under the carpet. I will sweep me under the carpet and I will try to be something else that I am not.\"\n\nThe possibility for proper values and ideals through intuition. Not through thinking, not through feeling, but spontaneously through intuition. The possibility that the depth of the intuition will be treated superficially. Jiirgen had a client with this line in the detriment. She was a stewardess and that was what she did between landing and the new departure. She had only a little time to clean everything, so she hid the dirt."

      "hd_title": "Acuteness",
      "full_text": "Third lines and fourth lines carry individual themes, and we are dealing with an individual process here in the 57th gate. This third line is of special significance. It is one of the nine hexagrams in which there is a singularity instead of a polarity. It is called Acuteness. There is no detriment.\n\nIt has Mercury exalted. The perfected intelligence, where clarity eliminates doubt and ensures manifestation. Third lines are about adaptation. This is the capacity to adapt to life. This is the survival of the species. This is the ability to adapt in the now to life, to the threat of life, to the potentials of being alive, to the potentials of the Perfected Form, to the potentials of Penetrating Awareness. All of that is rooted in the third line as a capacity. By the way, it is still a third line, which means it can be very irresponsible. It can adapt for itself, for its own survival, while leaving others behind, while not caring for others, while not adapting to be able to look after them as well.\n\nThe third line is the first attempt of going to the other side and, in doing so, it gets the glory that the 57 looks for. \"I am afraid of tomorrow and now I am in the now, and in the now there is no tomorrow. In no tomorrow I am alive and everything about my consciousness says, 'This is correct. I am alive. \"The reality is that this Acuteness, though it is a very beautiful line, is for the individual alone. But the moment that that has something to do with anybody else, this is not so nice. This is individual adaptation. It is an individual theme and can be coldly cruel in ignoring the needs of others. They are part of the great disappearing act. If they disappear, follow them. They will survive."

      "hd_title": "The Director",
      "full_text": "'v a come to the upper trigram and have the resonance to the first line. The fourth line is called The Director. The mastery of relationships that through clarity can maximize productivity, while the sensitivity to inter-relationships will ensure harmony.\n\nHere lies the intuition to be able to stay alive through a need for others. These are people that are always going to be dependent on others to keep them alive so that they can get their form. The 57 needs the 10, the 20 and the 34. Due to its externalization quality, everything about the fourth line is that it is deeply focused and fixed in one area. These people are fixed on the relationship. They are fixed on being able to deal with their fear of tomorrow by intuitively recognizing how to handle their relationships with others. This is by its nature very selfish. Because it is a fourth line, it resonates to the emotional wave of kindness/meanness and brotherhood/sisterhood. It resonates to the awareness field of Corruption. Think about this, what it actually means. The fourth line, The Director, is definitely a skill. It is an intuitive capacity to work with people in order to be able to survive in the now.\n\nMars in detriment. A tendency to be dictatorial rather than directorial. This goes back to the individual not wanting to be led. This is an individual that says, \"Yes, you do this. If you do not do this, the boat sinks.\" They are interested in being able to stay alive.\n\nThe possible intuitive clarity to master relationships. For the benefit of survival, for the benefit of getting to the now, for the benefit of getting the energy of the 34.\n\nOn the other side: With such a gift, the possibility of being intuitively dictatorial. Intuitively dictatorial is not being able to say, \"Stop thatl\" or, \"Blame them.\" It is not a mental concept. Many people who have this line may end up feeling very guilty in their life because they hear themselves being intuitively dictatorial in the moment, and they wonder why they are like that because they do not really know. Everything that you see in the line, you will get. When you have the detriment of this line, you will be intuitively dictatorial and that is all subjective. These people are like that because it is not up to them to be able to survive. So the whole thing is that they are always convinced that they need others to help them to survive, and in that moment they tell people what to do in order that they can survive. The rest may survive too but they are only interested in themselves. It is individual. \"You keep your finger in the dike.\""

      "hd_title": "Progression",
      "full_text": "In the fifth line, we change from an individual theme to a collective theme and in doing so, we find the opportunity to bring survival techniques or survival awareness from the individual to the collective. Remember that the individual is always mutating the collective. I know this line intimately because I have my personality Earth in there, and I get my grounding there.\n\nIt is called Progression. The natural ability to establish new forms while maintaining the powers of re- evaluation and re-examination. This provides the clarity to examine the data and assess the process. This is all at the intuitive level. It is at an intuitive level that one can recognize forms that can allow the collective to survive. It is what it is rooted in.\n\nIn the detriment: The tendency to keep on keeping on that can end up as a misguided missile. When in action, the intuition may become overwhelmed and unable to assess and evaluate its progress. I am a single definition doer. What happened to me in my life is that once I got into action, I would forget all about where my intuition would guide me because the intuition can be overpowered all the time. I watched that with the Moon, when it comes once a month. When the Moon is in this line my intuition gets blinded. Whatever my body, my physical process is into gets overwhelmed. That is neither good nor bad. In those moments, obviously, it is not for me to know.\n\nLines that are positive or negative in terms of the language: that does not mean that they are in reality. You live out your own nature and you discover that everything in your own nature is exactly the way it should be. Now, I have Pluto sitting there at the other side and I am deeply involved in my intuitive process, which is just listening to it. This is the whole thing about understanding the nature of the whole intuitive system anyway. This is not a mind system. This is not a mind awareness. This is something that you can only witness. You can only experience what your intuition tells you and allow it to guide you, if that is your nature, your design."

      "hd_title": "Utilization",
      "full_text": "The roof of the house. The line of transition. The acceptance that clarity is a double-edged sword. There are situations where understanding cannot lead to rectification. Here, Uranus' innovative quality can generally make the best out of an otherwise difficult but rarely permanent situation. The intuition does not always give you an answer that is of any value. It does not always help. Your intuition can tell you something, it can lead you somewhere (anyone who has the sixth line will know that) but it won't always give you the answer. Due to that, it can lead to depression.\n\nAll sixth lines can have this quality because they are looking for something much larger. They are not just looking to survive. They want to survive with a quality of life. They want life to be of value. They are looking to survive in their Perfected Form. They want to fulfill the nature of their Archetype. They are looking to be awake. All of that is part of the nature of the 57th gate.\n\nMars in detriment. When clarity points' to a problem one is unable because of circumstances to solve, a tendency to anger and frustration that provokes inevitably hftile action. Both the 48th gate and the 57th gate carry in them the potential for frustration, the 48th gate much more than the 57th. The sixth line recognizes the nature of intuition (it is the completion of the process here in this line) and it knows that it cannot answer everything. It can be relied on to be your intuition but it cannot be relied on to be God. It does not have all the answers. This is deeply annoying to the sixth line and in those moments when the intuition cannot do that, there is this anger about tomorrow.\n\nSome people go through life angry about what tomorrow is going to be. Here is somebody who is not afraid of tomorrow. They are angry and frustrated that they have to deal with tomorrow. They are looking for the One-NightStand. They are looking for the magic. They are looking for something very special and their intuition cannot always give them that.\n\nThese people are very likely to stop paying attention to their intuitive system. They easily deny that they have an intuition. They will tell you that it is their mind. I tell people with the sixth line, \"You have a very good intuition,\" and they answer, \"Yes, but it is my thinking.\" They have no idea where this is coming from because there is this sense of frustration that the intuition cannot guide them to the Holy Grail that all sixth lines are looking for.\n\nWhen you get to the next step for this sixth line, it is the 32nd hexagram first line: A life sustaining respect to all aspects of a process, the line of Conservation, to not be a failure. What the sixth line is ultimately looking towards is an intuition that will never fail it. That is why they get so angry and frustrated because the intuition will fail you. Your mind will fail you too. Your emotions will fail you. We are limited."

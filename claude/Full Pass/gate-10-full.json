Think of the nature of genetic continuity as it applies to the 10.1.\n\nThe line is called Modesty. I have a nickname for this line. I call this line the line of the chameleon. Always. The moment that you try to tell them that they are not acting correctly, you deeply offend them and they suffer from hurt feelings, of course, because inside of them, genetically, they know (this is all about knowing) that their behavior is correct.\n\nIn the white book. The ability to know one's place and how to act despite circumstances. This is the answer to having a second class ticket. So what? Sit in second class, so what? I get on airplanes across the Atlantic Ocean and there are all those people in first class. I have a second class ticket. What to do? I will not complain and whine that I don't have a first class ticket. I have a second class ticket. Sit in second class. Accept your place. It is hard for human beings to just accept what the gods have dished out for them. It is the only way. This is the correct behavior and it is the foundation of all behavior. It is the foundation of the behavior that creates perfected form. It is the foundation of the behavior for the perfection of conviction. It is the foundation of the behavior to be awake. Accept your place."

      "hd_title": "The Hermit",
      "full_text": "Here in the 10th gate you have a theme of behavior, a code of behavior for all second lines which is being The Hermit. The overview says: The successful side-stepping of behavioral requirements... ('Behavioral requirements' is conditioning.) ...through isolation. We have seen in our work together that all second lines tend to suffer from the fact that they don't know that there is somebody who will burst in on them and see them and try to condition them because they can see into them. The hermit is the correct behavior: withdraw rather than accept conditioning away from what is your nature.\n\nMercury exalted. Mental functions enrich aloneness. Mars in detriment. The angry exile. Whichever way that comes out, it is better to withdraw than to accept the conditioning. To be the hermit is so important. The other thing is: in the genetic continuity, as in the 12.2 Purification, The Hermit is somebody who has to rigorously withdraw from negative forces. That is the role of the behavior of the hermit: it is not simply to withdraw, but to withdraw from negative forces, not from all forces. Negative forces are those forces that apply conditioning and try to change the nature of the hermit, to bring the hermit out of his isolation.\n\nIn the white book: Independent behavior through isolation, or Isolation to preserve independent behavior in the face of conditioning. That is the most important aspect of it because that is the real key to all second lines. The moment that somebody is trying to break in on your second line and condition you, withdraw. It is better for you to withdraw and be in your own process because this is what is healthy and it is the only way in which you are going to find love for yourself.\n\nThink about that. What happens is that when people recognize you for something and they pull on you, you tend to confuse that with love. It is not; nor should it be. That is, those people that can look into you and try to pull you, they try to pull you by getting you to recognize your nature and turn it into something motivated. They try to pump you up. This has nothing to do with the role of the hermit. The role of the hermit is to avoid such conditioning in order to have an opportunity to be awake."

      "hd_title": "The Martyr",
      "full_text": "We come to the story of the third line which is about martyrs. Think about the nature of what the third line is. It is always in a situation (lower trigram) in which it tries to get out of its process, only to be confronted by the outside. In the moment of being confronted by the outside, it is being forced to adapt because it was not prepared for what was there on the outside. In the nature of behavior, when you come to the third line, you come to trial and error in the process of behavior. Now, remember that third lines can lead to the sixth line of wisdom. That trial and error in behavior can be something that is of enormous value to humanity, but, at the same time, it is a trial and error process. What may be discovered by living out that trial and error is something else. It may turn out to be something that is of value.\n\nThe Martyr overview line: The futile rejection of standards based on a just awareness. Futile rejection: it does not do any good to reject it. Here are human beings who, without choice, have a genetic code for behavior and that code of behavior, because it is trial and error, will often be in conflict with the behavior of those that surround it and meet it. No matter how much they live out their own nature, they are constantly going to meet resistance from those around them. Of course, it is not easy for them to give up that nature. It is, after all, what they are.\n\nThe Earth exalted. The martyr as an enduring example whose behavior is ultimately enshrined. When a human being is living out their own nature, whether anybody likes it or not in the now, that has nothing to do with whether or not it is truly of value. The 10th gate is individual and deeply related in that sense to the first gate in the self, to its individuality. It speaks about this process of time, that as a creative process, to have different behavior than other people is not something that is recognized in your own time necessarily as a possible variation that others can follow. It simply may be seen as disruptive, anti-social, freakish and a threat, most of all. After all, behavior is the most important conditioning we get. It can be very threatening to have somebody whose behavior has impact on others and who becomes a role model (sixth line).\n\nThe other thing is that, being individual, this is a behavior that can be mutative and can bring about change and most of all, individuals and individual aspects are always seeking attention. Therefore, the behavior of the 10 and the 10.3 is always getting attention: \"You should not act like that, Johnny.\" \"Stop picking your nose, Johnny.\" He may do it for the rest of his life until somebody slaps him in the face, until his behavior so violates the standards or the norms that somebody resists it. Remember, all of these gates of the self are always dependent on what they meet as beings on the other side.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. The martyr complex. The active pursuit of martyrdom for personal aggrandizement. Here the ego is touched. These are people who make a living from their behavior. The way these people act in the world attracts attention and because of that, they maintain that behavior in order to continue to maintain that attention.\n\nIn the white book: Behavior that is ultimately challenged by others. I tell all 10.3's when someone challenges them: \"If it is your nature, martyr away because the more people resist you the better you know that you are living yourself.\" So many of these people have very thin skins and they are so easily upset by what other people say or comment on about the nature of their behavior.\n\nOften their reaction is going to the other side: Behavior as a way to attract attention. \"If you don't like my behavior, watch me because I will not change it,\" and they use it to their advantage to attract attention. They can, they do, and they will. Then you see the impact on the self of having other forces come and impose on them and condition them."

      "hd_title": "The Opportunist",
      "full_text": "Dealing with the upper trigram, we have a different process at work because the fourth and fifth lines are rather gifted in the sense that they are going to recognize not only that there is one other source of conditioning, but that they are going to come to grips with all three other sources. In other words, the fourth and fifth lines of the 10th hexagram have deep transpersonal skills because they do have recognition of the impact of the other.\n\nThe fourth line as a behavior is a code for all fourth lines for this one-tracked-ness, the fixedness. Its behavioral code is The Opportunist. The acceptance of norms until a successful transformation can be engendered. It is very important to understand that. The whole thing about the nature of the behavior in the fourth line is that it has to wait for its opportunity, which means that it cannot give up behavior until there is a place to go with that behavior.\n\nMy analogy for this is: if you have a job and you are a 10.4 and you want a new job, you cannot quit your job until you have a new one. This is opportunism. You stay with the nature of your fixedness until there is an opportunity or you wait simply for that opportunity to externalize your fixedness. Again, there is always the possibility that the opportunist has enormous influence: to be able to wait for the right moment to act can often lead to a great deal of good fortune or success.\n\nWe have this overview and so it takes time: the acceptance of norms until a successful transformation can be engendered. Accept the nature of your behavior until the behavior can really change. Somebody who has the 10.4 and is deeply conditioned and they come to Human Design. They are not going to be able to change their nature. They will not be able to change their nature until that opportunity is really there for them. That opportunity has to be there. For example, you are a generator and you are a 10.4. You cannot just suddenly become a generator. You have to wait for that opportunity when somebody says to you, \"Excuse me, could you help me?\" and you go, \"Uh-huh.\" Then you can jump into that behavior: to wait for the opportunity.\n\nUranus exalted. Transformation that is transcendence to a higher code. The whole thing about the opportunist is that you are looking for the opportunity to externalize your nature and that is the highest possible code. There is nothing higher.\n\nMercury in detriment. Opportunism as a game and/or mental exercise. Most of that is because the 10th gate has no guarantee that it is going to have access to a motor in order to manifest. So often it is speculating on those moments of opportunity when they may not arrive, or they are the kind of people who think, \"Here is a perfect opportunity to make a million dollars,\" but never do it because it is a game, and because they do not have within themselves, within the nature of their design, the real opportunity to live out that opportunism.\n\nIn the white book: The maintaining of behavioral patterns until the right moment and opportunity for transformation. It is so important for 10.4's just to sit back and wait for that moment to live out their nature. The other side: Altering one's behavioral patterns in order to take advantage of opportunities. It is the same thing, just on the other side but it is also speculative. It is waiting for those opportunities and they may not be ready to do that at that moment. Remember, not everybody who has the 10.4 is going to be a manifestor or a generator. They may not have the opportunity to act it out and then it becomes something game4ike or speculative."

      "hd_title": "The Heretic",
      "full_text": "The 10.5 has enormous impact on society. After all, the 10 is part of Integration and Integration is the backbone of being in the body, of being individuated. The 10.5 is where society projects onto behavior and onto how it wants to see behavior. Society sees the behavior at its most interesting as being heretical. It is society that sees if your behavior is unique and individual and it in fact may be dangerous to the whole. All fifth lines are at one time exciting and at another time a threat to society because it is the source of society's projections and, therefore, can be the source of society's disappointment if those projections fail.\n\nWhen you come to the fifth line, you come to The Heretic. As an overview line it says: Direct and overt challenge to norms. One of the things to realize about the 10.5 is the need of society for a heretic, for a behavior that will challenge the norms. It is society that creates The Heretic, that creates The General, that creates all of these roles: The Savior, The Saint, all of these figures. It is society that creates it out of its own needs and its owi4 projections. The heretic is created by society because they project onto the behavior of the 10.5 that it is either very exciting or very threatening.\n\nJupiter exalted. The ability to succeed through the understanding and expression of higher principles. Mars in detriment. The burning 0~ie stake. What exactly is the difference? There is a profound difference. Remember that the fifth line is there to challenge the norms of society. In the white book: Principled behavior which directly challenges tradition. This is not a challenge to the way an individual acts in the world. This is not going up to somebody who has a rooster haircut and picking on them because they have a rooster haircut. This is not dealing with tradition. This is just dealing with unusual behavior. When you look at the other side, the Mars side: Behavior which directly challenges behavior and is eventually punished. If you go up to the punk and say, \"This is ridiculous, nobody should walk around like this\", don't be surprised if they rearrange your face.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the heretic is at its greatest when they attack the framework of behavior that has to be changed. Because the 10.5 is the vanguard of changing behavior, if they just attack the behavior on the surface they are the ones that suffer. They get burned at the stake because it becomes very personal. They are here to try to challenge the underlying tradition. If they do that, ultimately, they can be regarded as a very special force in the world.\n\nHow they are going to react is again subject to the conditioning that they receive themselves. The 10.5 that has no fuel and no access to awareness or no access to manifestation is always going to be conditioned by others. A 10.5 being conditioned by somebody else's awareness may end up attacking somebody's behavior and being punished for it simply because they were conditioned that way, rather than that being the most natural and healthy way for them. It is a very important line because, again, society has been calling for this. It is calling for a heretic that will challenge tradition and, in challenging tradition, provide mutation for behavior.\n\nVery interesting is the genetic continuity here, particularly because the genetic continuity as seen through the mystical process is the relationship between the 10.5 and the 49.5. The 49th gate is a gate of being the sacrificer and the sacrificed. It is the gate of emotional principles and the fifth line in its exalted form is about providing practical provisions for revolutionary times, in the same way that the heretic really brings something very practical when they deal with the tradition itself. That is what they are equipped to do: to look at the tradition and to see whether or not a tradition deserves to stand or whether or not it is time for mutation of behavior.\n\nPractical provisions: in the detriment of the 49.5 you have the same Mars in detriment, which is all about power. The moment that you make things personal is the moment that you get into a power trip with people. For example, you say to them, \"Your behavior stinks,\" and they return, \"Your behavior stinks.\" Nothing productive will come out of that. In order to change the behavior of society, what has to be dealt with and challenged is the underlying tradition out of which that behavior has risen. Practical provisions; otherwise expect to be sacrificed."

      "hd_title": "The Role Model",
      "full_text": "If you will look in this life for people that are the most self-conscious, you will find them in the 10.6. They are constantly under pressure, constantly self-concerned about the nature of their behavior. Built into them is the understanding that behavior can be hypocritical. They recognize that. The line is called The Role Model.\n\nA very powerful line: The perfect expression of the norms through action rather than words. They learn their self-consciousness well with their harmony to the 20.3, Self-awareness, or through the 57.3, Acuteness. They learn to recognize very quickly in their life that it is possible to say things but not necessarily possible to live them out. They see that very early. They recognize within themselves that their behavior is very important. But no matter how much they want to be able to behave perfectly, they always run into obstacles because they end up being conditioned by the people around them that they are dependent on. Even the words can only come out if there is a connection to the 20 and the awareness can only guide it if there is a 57 and the energy is only there if there is a 34.\n\nRemember that sixth lines look to the whole circuit, but the first thing a 10.6 looks at is Integration. It says, \"How can I maintain the holiness of myself. How can I guarantee my survival in the world? How can I be me? How can I do what is right for me to do in the world?\" All of that ends up being dependent on so many other beings.\n\nPluto exalted. The constant example that refocuses the complacent on the basic integrity of set behavior. They know how important behavior is. If you have a 10.6 parent, you will discover that, while they are picking their nose, they tell you, \"Don't pick yours: bad behavior.\" 10.6's recognize that correct behavior is very important. What is frustrating is that, because they know that better than anybody else and because so often they can't live it out, they would rather not be seen. They would rather sit on the roof and not be anybody's example because, even though they can be hypocritical, they suffer a great deal from their own hypocrisies.\n\nThe other side of this is Saturn in detriment. The hypocrite. Do as I say, not as I do. We have seen this as a gift in all sixth lines: the 40.6 that sits on top of the house and looks to its family and says, \"I see who is messing things up here,\" and can easily point it out. The 10.6 has this deep capacity to point out to you what is the correct behavior. By the way, I tell these people: go ahead. Tell other people how to behave. It is part of your gift and don't feel self-conscious because you yourself can't act the way you tell other people to act. Everybody has to accept their limitation, whatever it happens to be. This 10.6 leads to the 20.6, to the line of wisdom. There is an enormous potential here to be awake to the beauty of self, but this is not an easy process.\n\nIn the white book: The enduring value of expression of the Self through action rather than words. In the end it all comes down to the same thing. It comes down to how you live in the world. The only action that matters, whether it is action that you generate or manifest or whether it is action that is conditioned as manifestation or generation in your life, it that you cannot be taken away from your nature. As long as you are not taken away from your nature, you are an example for others. This is the great value of the 10th gate and, as an example for others, you are a source of wisdom for them in their lives.\n\nOf all the sixth lines that we have looked at, none makes a more beautiful turn than the 10.6 because the 10.6 goes to the 58.1. It goes to The Joyous and it goes to the most beautiful line of the 384: the line of Love of life. In the end, the 10.6 must find for itself love of life and the vitality that comes from loving life. It is not the vitality that creates the love of life. It is the love of life that creabs the vitality. Th., 10.6 sits up there and knows the correct behavior but it also knows that that behavior is what brings about the love - life and out of that love of life comes the power to correct the collective, comes the power to establish new patterns, comes the power to release the example in the world. Good luck.\n\nIt always brings me back to where I started 1 1 years ago. When we go through this process of looking at the G center, it brings me back to my own mantra: You are unique. You have no choice. Love yourself. There is nothing else. There really is nothing else."

This is a key. This is fundamental.\n\nRemember the relationship that exists between the logical process and all other forms of life. Whether you are looking at plants, at animals, at insects or at a single cell, you are dealing with forms that have something in common. What they have in common is logic. It is very important for us. Without secure patterns upon which we can project into the future, it puts an enormous strain on our ability to survive."

      "full_text": "When you get to the second line, you get to a line that is called Arrogance. Remember that the nature of this hexagram is to transfer a pattern. In that way, you lead. When you come to the second line, you come to people that are projecting out that they are the leader. Well, yes, but then again, leadership is something that takes time. You have to develop certain skills. You have to go through a process. If you are five years old and you are yelling, \"I am the leader. Follow mel\" you may run into difficulties. If you are 40 years old and you haven't figured it out and you are yelling, \"I am the leader. Follow mel\" you will run into difficulties.\n\nArrogance is Independent action without guidance."

      "full_text": "The nature of a third line is that, in a sense, it is combining the qualities of the first and second line, the qualities of introspection and projection. It puts them together into this potential for adaptation. When you get to this third line, you get to the key to successful political leadership which lies here. It is called Selectivity, which is about recognizing first of all, who should be a follower? This is so important in terms of influence. If you influence somebody that cannot implement your pattern, there is very little impact. If you influence somebody that can implement your pattern, it will have a lot of impact. This is the whole nature of selectivity. It is not about how many people support you. It is about what is the quality of that support? Who are they?\n\nSun exalted. The ability to carefully assess and choose the proper influence and to tailor one's behavior accordingly. Think about that because there is a kind of twist in that. The politician has to be influenced by the follower, so we have all of these followers. They have lobbies and causes and they all have their way that they try to influence the person who actually acts as the leader. The leader has to recognize that every follower that they have has their own agenda. They have to carefully select what influences they want to accept from their followers in order to maintain their role as a leader of those followers. So, they have to be very careful and clear about with what those followers want to influence them, so that they can be their guide, in that sense."

      "line": 4,
      "hd_title": "Intent",
      "full_text": "When we get to this upper trigram, we get to the fourth and fifth lines which are transpersonal. They are deeply aware of the other side and deeply aware of the identity and that they need to project out this role of being a leader. The fourth line, the line of Intent, is an unusual line. Whenever I meet this line in people's readings, I exactly meet the same phenomena in their lives. The fourth line is about externalizing. It is about having this one-trackedness that we are very well aware of by now. What you have here is: The success of influence based on how it is perceived.\n\nThink about how this works. You have two people who have exactly the same problem, theoretically. They come to the 31.4 with exactly the same problem and the 31.4 transfers their influence to each of them and tells each of them exactly the same thing. The 31.4 leads them (this is the voice, \"I lead\") in this way. You have these two people, they have exactly the same problem, they go to the same leader, the leader tells them exactly the same thing and one of the two people, no matter how it all comes out, will love them and the other one will hate them. One of them thinks that they are the best leader that ever lived and the other will think that they are a terrible, manipulative bastard that should not be in the world.\n\nFor the 31 .4, no matter how they externalize it, there are always those that like it and those that do not like it, no matter whether it is a good or a bad thing. It makes no difference. This is the nature of intent.\n\nThe Moon exalted. Public acknowledgment of a nurturing and protective influence. Or Mars in detriment: Perceived ego aggrandizement and attempted manipulation. If you have that fixed on one side or the other, your influence can always be perceived as being very nice and valuable and helpful, or your influence is perceived as being terrible. But for most people who have this line, they are always getting this polarity, no matter what they do.\n\nIn the white book: External positive recognition of one's capacity to lead, or External negative projection of one's capacity to lead. In other words, it does not make any difference. This is just about externalizing the influence and, because this is the resonance to the foundation, everybody who is in the position of being a leader recognizes that no matter what they do, there will be a segment in the population that hates it and another segment in the population that loves it.\n\nThat is the nature of collective direction. You can't please all of the people all of the time. This is what this fourth line has to recognize. Very difficult in children. After all, a child that has the 31 st gate is a child that has within it a genetic capacity to lead, and if they have the fourth line, even when they lead in a successful way, even when their leadership is of value, they will have to deal with other kids in their group who will hate them for that, even though other kids love them for the very same leadership.\n\nThis can be very difficult, particularly for people who have an undefined emotional system, to be this kind of leader. The 3 1 .4 with an open emotional system will have such a thin skin and will be so easily disturbed by the negative side that they will fail to see the positive attributes of their leadership.\n\nIt is very important to understand something intrinsic in the collective process: it is not personal. That is one of the reasons why we do not particularly like our leaders personally. The collective is not personal. The moment we make it personal, we have a problem. This is collective leadership and, in the collective sense, you are always going to meet criticism. You will meet those who are satisfied with you and those who are dissatisfied with you. You need to have a thick skin. Whenever I meet somebody with the 3 I tell them: you have to have a thick skin because you can't expect that what you do is going to get universal approval. It will never get universal approval. You get half of the people and the other half will not like it. That is just the way it works."

      "hd_title": "Self-righteousness",
      "full_text": "The first line always shows us the basic nature of a hexagram and we have seen that the nature of this gate of Influence is to manifest the influence, to make the transference. When we get to the fifth line, we see how leadership is perceived by the world and the way people perceive influence and those that carry influence is this line of Self-righteousness. It is projected on the universal leader that they are only interested in themselves. They are only interested in power, in being the boss, in being in charge. This is the standard world view impression of our leaders: that they are in it for their own self-aggrandizement.\n\nLack of external influence guaranteed by attitude. Pluto exalted. A natural specialization that one develops in isolation. However, when the development is complete, the extremely difficult and generally impossible task of externalizing the influence.\n\nThis is a line that is universal. These are the only ones in the first five lines of leadership that are really only interested in being their own leader. The fifth line is interested in being its own leader. It is very fixed on leading itself. It is not so concerned about being anybody else's leader, but the outside world is projecting on them, because they look like people who are leading themselves, that they have influence and are comfortable with their direction. Other people project on them and say, \"Hey, what about us? Why don't you share that with us?\"\n\nThe fifth line recognizes the pull that is coming from the other side, but the other side, in the 7.5, is The General. This is about only being a leader in times of crisis. This is not your everyday leader. It is a difficult task to externalize this quality of leadership and only in times when it is absolutely essential, when the pressure is the most profound, is there a possibility for these people to externalize that influence.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. A deep focus on personal experience that is self-fulfilling and has no external ambitions. \"I am too busy leading my own life, why should I lead yours? My life is much more important to me than the collective's life and, aside from that, I do not think that you got it right. \" (The resonance to the arrogance in the second line.)\n\nIn the white book: A specialization that demands that one lead oneself; or A lack of ambition where one is content to lead oneself. These are reluctant leaders, but at the same time, when they do get into power, they are very effective. Then they get this whole projection on them that they are the self-righteous ones.\n\nI always use the illustration of ancient Greece. Athens would get into trouble and they would hire a dictator who organized society and the army and got everything done. When everything was coming to a conclusion, then all the so-called democrats started saying, \"They are only concerned about themselves. They are really self-righteous and not really concerned about us, and thus it's time for them to go. \" This is the real quality of leadership that the outside is projecting on: the self-righteous leader that does not really care about you, that only cares about themselves and therefore, one has to be concerned about the nature of their leadership. You can see the resonance in the gate of behavior in the 10.5, The Heretic, saying, \"Why do you force me to lead you? You will only hang me afterwards.\"\n\nWe saw in the fifth lines throughout that they all have to do with timing. We saw in the 8.5, Dharma, that you have to know when to let people out of your taxi cab. We saw in the 33.5 that you have to have the right timing in order to know when to release the secrets. The same thing is true for this form of leadership. It only works at certain times. The time has to be right and then the power of that leadership can be actualized. It is a matter of timing."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Application",
      "full_text": "When we get to the sixth line, we get to the transition line. We know that the transition is rooted in the awareness frequency of trust or not. \"Can I really trust in this? Can it really go beyond?\" If you are looking at the whole logical circuit, \"Will this leadership provide humanity with a secure future?\" When you get to the sixth line, you get to the fundamental recognition of limitation. Sixth lines get to see or get to experience the limitation in their own process.\n\nThe sixth line says Application. This is not a gate of action. To manifest logic is very hard. You have to go down the talent channel and down the 18/58. It is a long process to get to the energy. That is why our collective systems are corrupt. Political parties are looking for money. It is so difficult to get to the energy.\n\nThis line says: Actions which match the words and thus guarantee success. The 31.6 says, \"Yes, I can say that, but whether that is actually going to happen is another story. I can transfer that influence but whether it is actually going to manifest is another story. I don't think it really will. I will have to come up with a leadership, a pattern that is so vital, so essential that humanity will offer its energy to it. Otherwise, it is not going to work.\"\n\nWhen it does not work, when the power to actually manifest as doing is not there, then you get the Moon in detriment. A superficiality in application that borders on hypocrisy and is justifiably treated accordingly. People who have the 31.6 learn very early in life that when they say, \"I lead. I will do this,\" and then they can't because they do not have access to the energy, they then sound like hypocrites. They end up saying, \"Do what I say not what I do because I can't do it myself.\" Because they learn that very quickly, there is a part of them that stands back and says, \"I am not going to lead anything because there is no guarantee that I am going to have the energy to be able to manifest my program.\" That is like somebody saying: \"I'll be the political leader of this party if you can assure me that everybody is going to vote for me and I win; Otherwise, I do not want to be the leader. I mean, why should I be the leader of this party when I can't win and actually influence society? Why should I be the leader of this party if all I can do is to talk when I won't be able to do anything about it? I won't be able to show that it really works.\"\n\nThe joke is that the 31.6 goes to the 33.1. It goes back to Retreat. It goes to the abstract process. The first line of the gate of Retreat is Avoidance which is all about sitting there and going through this process of withdrawing so that you can reflect on it. The 31.6 is saying, \"What I would really like to be able to see is that if I am the head of the party: everybody votes for me and then I bring in this program and we actualize it. Then I can sit over here in the 33rd gate and I can look back at it and say, \"Yes, based on experience, I made a real contribution to society.\" Puffing the horse before the cart is the whole trap in the collective process. Don't expect these people to lead you unless they have a chance to get everything. If they do not have a chance to get it all, if they can't win and direct, they are not going to be in such a hurry to lead at all."

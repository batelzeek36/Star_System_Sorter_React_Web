      "full_text": "When we get to the beginning of any hexagram structure, we begin with the first line in the lower trigram. Remember that the lower trigram does not know that there is anything else at the other end of the channel. So, they are not social and are quite surprised, even though it happens to be a social channel, the channel of the social marriage contract, in that sense. The first three lines are not socially gifted. First lines are only interested in the foundation. They themselves tend to be invisible. In other words, they are the kind of ego you can't find to tell them that the refrigerator is empty. They are out in the backyard somewhere having a snooze. They don't want to have anything to do with that. While they are lying there, they are trying to figure out if willpower is something of value in the first place.\n\nThe first line, which always represents the essence of any hexagram, is called Recuperation. It tells you what the ego requires. It can only be used for so long and then it must have its rest. If you look at any kind of long-term relationship of couples where the man comes home from work and just throws himself on the sofa and turns on the TV and blares out his brain, and there is this whole list of things that he could be doing. You can't ask him. If you do that, it will create problems because that willpower is also ego. \"Don't bother me now.\" The ego must have its rest. When you give it its rest, everything works.\n\nThe ability to relax and enjoy the fruits of one's labors. Whenever I see somebody with this line, I always remind them of one thing: Your friends are only of value to you as long as they don't take you aside and say, \"Excuse me, you really have a problem.\" For this kind of person, friendship is not having people tell them that they have a problem that their willpower has to deal with, that they have to go out and do something about. They just want to be able to relax. They will do their work if you let them relax. They need to relax.\n\nThis is true for the stomach. It is very important for any human being to understand the nature of nutrition. You cannot eat if you are not hungry anymore than willpower can be used if it is not the right time and the person who has that capacity does not want to be involved in that process. This is devastating for the system. It is extremely unhealthy and creates what people call ulcers. It creates all kinds of difficulties within the physical stomach itself.\n\nThe Moon is in detriment. The Moon cannot stand still. The whole thing about this is that this 40th gate, though it requires its rest, it cannot just rest. If it can rest when it comes home from work, it has to get up the next day and go out into the world and do its thing. In the social context, these are people who do not stay with the same relationships in their lifetime. Their communities and families go through changes because what they are looking for is to be left in peace.\n\nIn the white book: The ego strength to enjoy being alone. The 40th gate says, \"I don't need you.\" This is not true. The 40th gate and the 26th gate are gates of denial. It is in their mechanism to say, \"Don't bother me now.\" In order to get the ego to do anything, you have to massage it. That is why this \"don't bother me\" is not true. Otherwise, it will say, \"I will stay alone,\" and the other says, \"Oh, no you can't. We really need you. We have to have you. You are so important to us.\" They have to be pulled into the game.\n\nThe other side is: The ego uncomfortable with being alone too long. After the 40th gate had its rest, it says, \"Why isn't there anybody around being nice to me and asking me to go to work? And who needs me? Why doesn't somebody need met\" So, they are ready to look for somebody who will need them, so that their ego can be puffed up and they can go out and come back and say, \"Hey, don't bother me now. I'm getting my rest.\""

      "hd_title": "Resoluteness",
      "full_text": "When you are dealing with the second line, you are dealing with a light on inside the house and people can see in. Wherever you have the second line, you have to learn in life that other people see things in you that you don't see yourself. The 40th hexagram is about aloneness in the ego sense, as we have seen. The ego requires its time for rest. It seeks to be alone so that it is not pulled on as an ego force. The second line does not know very much about being social and other people. Other people are walking by its house, looking through its window and they say, \"This one is alone, but this one can have a very strong will. If we can get to this one, it is able to do something for us.\" All of a sudden, the 40 is surprised that there is somebody there that is pulling on their willpower.\n\nResoluteness. The power and authoriy in deliverance... (aloneness) ... to shed forever the qualities which hampered liberation. In other words, for the second line, aloneness is something that is very healthy. It is good for them. After all, they don't know how to deal with the outside anyway, so they are stuck on the inside.\n\nWhen you come to the detriment, you have: A natural peacefulness that in deliverance may sympathize with and attempt to nurture the forces which hampered liberation. By the way, liberation is just a word for rest. It is better to be alone than having people around who constantly pull you into work. That is what this line is saying at its exalted side, but at its detriment side it is saying that one is defenseless in that moment that people look inside, see that you have the will and come and get it.\n\nOne of the jokes about me is that my second line is a projection. I project out that I am alone, but it is actually not that difficult to come up to me and ask me something, to come into my aura. There are people who know how to get in and take that.\n\nThe power through aloneness to recognize the importance and the potential disruptive effect of others. \"What they are going to get me into now?\" This is what you learn. All second lines collapse under recognition because this is what a second line is about. This is how they learn. All of a sudden, somebody sees something in you that you don't know is there. People are seeing in me that there is some chance to make a bargain, and I don't even know that is there. They can see that.\n\nThe other side is: The power of loneliness to blind the ego to the possible disruptive effect of others. When somebody gets in, because the second line doesn't know what to do with others, it is basically stuck, and it ends up getting pulled into things. The basic demand of the ego: \"Would you do me a favor?\" Anyone who is coming to the ego is coming for its will and its capacity to do things. The aloneness in this gate is all about saying, \"I'll be with you sometimes. But the rest of the time, leave me alone.\" Most of the people think that is very personal. In other words, they take it as a psychological statement rather than what it is. It is a pure ego statement. Willpower can only work so much. What happens to the second line is that it really gets disrupted because they don't really know what is going on inside of them. They are just busy in their aloneness."

      "hd_title": "Humility",
      "full_text": "Before you get to the Pluto exalted in this line, you have an overview statement that says: A calculated mode in deliverance to avoid attracting the attention of negative forces. Whenever you see an introduction in a line before the exalted and the detriment, that is telling you that you are dealing with a lifelong process, an ongoing process, and really is not something that is dealt with properly until one matures in life. All third lines are lines of adaptation, and as such are lines of trial and error.\n\nIt will be, in this line of Humility, a trial and error process to find out about aloneness, and to find out in your aloneness how not to attract negative forces. It does not mean that you don't attract them. It actually means that you will attract negative forces until you finally learn: better to be alone than to have this one or that one in your life. Remember that this is fundamentally social and communal, so it really is about the other in that sense.\n\nPluto exalted. The subtlety to enjoy deliverance... (being alone) ...without having to Haunt it. This is like not telling everybody, \"You have to work and I can rest. I have done mine.\" It is not about that. It is about enjoying your quiet time, your time between having to use the willpower.\n\nMars in detriment. The ego arrogance that demands attention and gets it. In the white book, it gives you a clear picture. It says: The capacity of the ego to avoid negative forces even if it means being alone. This is what the ego has to learn in the third line. It is better to be alone than to deal with negative forces.\n\nIn the detriment: The capacity of the ego to demand attention. And it gets it, which means that, literally, that ego ends up doing all kinds of things that it shouldn't, with the wrong influences in his life. It is so important to understand that the power of the will is dependant on the massage. If you have a 40 football team and you put them on the field where they are at home, and you have 40,000 people shouting their name, pumping them up, they will play better than if there are only ten people and they are all booing. In other words, the power of the will is always dependant on who is pulling on that will.\n\nThe 'negative forces' are those forces that do not allow that will to operate properly, or for that rest to be allowed in between. It is a trial and error process. It will take time in the life to develop that. They are better off alone than having to deal with negative forces. They are not better off alone in general. No ego can be alone forever. It must go out and do its business, but it is better to be alone than to be with negative forces. You have forces (other people) that say, \"I need you to do this. You have to work.\" If that ego does not have the power to do that, does not feel like doing that, does not have strength to do that, it is dealing with negative forces because they are pulling on it to do something that is not natural for them. Then it is better to be alone. Aloneness has to do with the stomach. You can only be alone so long before you go hungry. You have to feed yourself. You have to look after yourself. That is what the willpower is for. In the third line, it is a learning process."

      "hd_title": "Organization",
      "full_text": "With the fourth line, we come to the upper trigram, to a transpersonal process which is taking place in a social channel here. The fourth to sixth lines have specific social skills. Fourth lines are fixed and one-pointed. They are unidirectional, one-tracked.\n\nThe fourth line here is: The power to transform and the intuitive intellect to select and organize for the purpose of maintaining deliverance. All this means is: when you know that there is another side, how much work do you have to give them to keep them happy and quiet so that they continue to massage your ego and you'll have your chance for rest? In other words, the more you have your life together on the material plane, your job, your work, it is all very healthy. This is being organized. Being able to do your work and then having the time to be able to relax.\n\nThe Mars in detriment is different though. An uncontrollable zeal that ignores the quality of support in preference for the quantity, which in the long run may destabilize deliverance. These are people that drop dead from work. These are workaholics. We are dealing with a fourth line, so you are dealing with this fixed externalization. They are really onetracked. \"I will get my will out, and then I have to rest.\" When you get to the detriment, it is all about, \"Oh, this one wants me. Okay, I will do this work. This one wants me; I will get my will out.\" As long as they keep on getting their ego massaged, it can be very dangerous.\n\nThe fourth line in the white book: The power of the ego when organized and active to maintain separateness. Organize actively, do your ego work, and pull away and have your rest. In the same way as human beings do when they eat, they should have a chance to rest afterwards. It is healthy for them. In Spain, they have these big 'siestas.' You eat, and then everything is closed and there is nothing to do for hours, and it is correct. This is great for the stomach.\n\nOn the other side: The empowering of the ego through the capacity to organize others. The more they get into that organization, the less time they have left. They are so busy dealing with using their will that they don't take their rest. And again, this is something that is essential. We cannot overwork the ego. The more you overwork it, the less productive it becomes."

      "hd_title": "Rigidity",
      "full_text": "All first lines tell you about the intrinsic nature of a hexagram, and fifth lines tell you how everybody sees them. The ego is never seen by society as being something that is pleasant. The ego puts food in civilization's mouth and yet, at the same time, the ego says, \"Keep a low profile. Don't show it too much because it is not a nice thing.\"\n\nThe fifth line here is called Rigidity. The projection onto this ego is that it is rigid. The overview line here shows that it is a lifelong process. The recognition that to achieve liberation... (to achieve your rest) ...all negative forces must be rejected. The demands on the ego always have to be censored. The ego is standing there saying, \"What do you actually want from me? Tell me exactly. Then I know whether you are a positive or a negative force, so I know whether my will suits that. \"\n\nUranus exalted. The revolutionary who demands absolute victory. Absolute victory in this sense is, \"I do my thing when I want. And when I rest, leave me alone.\" Fifth lines in the 40 have great advantages in life because people project on them that that is exactly what they are going to be like. They will be rigid. This is what others project on them, \"This is a rigid ego. It will do its thing when it wants, and otherwise, it will do nothing.\" That is how society sees it.\n\nBy the way, it does not mean that that is true. You can see what happens in the detriment. Remember that the fifth line is in harmony to the second. In the second line, in the detriment, we saw the natural peacefulness that will let in the wrong force and have that wrong force pull it out of its aloneness. Here, the fifth line in the detriment is: A tendency in revolution to accept a certain amount of necessary deviation on the assumption that it can be successfully purged later.\n\n'Let them keep on making that kind of demand on me because it is nice that they are here giving me this massage. But afterwards, I will teach them not to do that.\" It is typical of the 40's rigidity. The power of the ego is maintained in the rejection of negative relationships. Remember, what is negative to the ego is simply anything that calls on it when it does not want to work. The ego is not an awareness. It is just a motor. You can have a 40 sitting at the telephone and they get 5 calls from people. Four of them ask them to do things, and they just don't like the people and do not identify with the thing. Then the fifth call comes and they say, \"I am ready,\" and off they go. They are ready to do it. It all depends on who is calling. This is what moves the world.\n\nThe weakness of the ego in its loneliness to maintain and not reject negative relationships. The ego is always vulnerable to its aloneness because it survives on the massage. Even though it needs to push the other away, it does not want to push them away too far. They want to make sure that they will be close enough later so that they can massage them again, so that they are ready to go back and do their thing. This is the nature of the ego. People do not particularly like it."

      "hd_title": "Decapitation",
      "full_text": "Sixth lines are never part of the hexagram. They are sifting on the roof and because of that, they have a totally different perspective. The 40.6 perspective is more than just the gate at the other end of the channel. It goes out to the entire circuit. It is looking at all of the possibilities that are there in the tribal circuitry. And more than that, the sixth line is moving in a track. The next thing that it is going to meet is the 64.1. It is on its way to many different things. When it is sifting up there on the roof, you cannot expect it to respond in the way the rest of the lines do.\n\nThis sixth line is called Decapitation. It is an overview line; it is a lifelong process. Remember something about all sixth lines. Whatever the description of a sixth line is, you live it out quickly when you are young and then you avoid it almost entirely for the rest of your life. If you have the 59.6, you have a lot of one night stands until the age of 18 to 25, and then you never do it again. The fact of the matter is that what happens with sixth lines is that you live them out, but the moment you realize that you are not getting what you want out of that, it stops. The sixth line is a cosmic fence sitter.\n\nIn this image of the community or the family, think about what this line says. It says: The necessary destruction of inferior forces in positions of power before liberation can take place. This is about, who are these people to make demands on the ego? You can imagine the 40.6 sitting on the roof of their house and looking into the garden and seeing their family there. They know which ones should be taken from power because they know exactly which ones put pressure on the will system that is not correct. They are inferior. They do not belong there. The will is an incredible thing if it is properly treated, but if not, it is a very destructive thing.\n\nThe Sun exalted. The authority, coupled with the magnanimity to remove from power only those who deserve such drastic treatment. All of the language here in this hexagram was about 'negative forces'. The sixth line talks about 'inferior forces'. The demands that the negative forces make on the will are legitimate; they are just not particularly good for that will and so are only negative in that sense. But the inferior forces make demands that are unfair, unnecessary, and unreasonable. They are the ones that have to be removed from power and that is the gift of the sixth line in the 40.\n\nThe Earth in detriment. Exemplified by the terror of the French revolution, where the idea of who was deserving of punishment was cruelly extended to an entire class. We are dealing with the tribe here. \"How dare the state tax me until I am dead? I will kill those bastards because they are inferior and destroying my society, my family, my life. They are taxing my willpower to the point that I cannot function anymore.\" That is not about negative forces anymore. That is about inferior forces because they make claims and bargains with the will that are unfair. \"You go out and do that for me, darling, and I will give you a reward.\" Then you go home and there is no reward. It is not fair, and the sixth line learns that very early. It climbs up to the top of the house and says, \"They have no right to tell me to do that.\"\n\nThe power and authority of the ego to reject individuals in legitimate defense of the group. If the ego is treated properly, everybody benefits. The other side is: The distortion of the ego through power and authority. What is important for the 40.6 is that if you have a child with this line, you cannot create false bargains with them. You cannot make these deals that are famous in tribes."

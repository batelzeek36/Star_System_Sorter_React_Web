      "hd_title": "Pleasure",
      "full_text": "The first line is always the foundation and it is introspection. The first line is called Pleasure. Understand, that that the whole thing about answers is that they are pleasurable. There is a pleasure in getting answers. That is why logic has to be seductive for us. It is necessary. It brings us pleasure to have answers.\n\nUltimate pleasure cannot be achieved without perfect timing. To give an answer at the wrong time can be disastrous. People have to be ready for that. Moon exalted. The instinct to know the right moment and circumstances where pleasure is rewarded and not punished. You can give an answer at one time and have a very angry response. You give an answer at another time and everybody is happy. The same is true for correction. One moment you offer to correct somebody and they think that you are bitching and the next moment the very same thing can be accepted as being valuable. It is a matter of knowing what the timing is.\n\nEarth in detriment. Timing is not a product of discipline. Exaggerated self-discipline leads to the abuse of pleasure. The most important thing about people who have the fourth gate is that they don't decide the timing. They are ready for the right time.\n\nThe potential to recognize that there is a natural timing to the understanding process. It is not about deciding the timing; it is about being ready for the right time. It is there, it comes. It is collective. In order for an answer to be valid, it still has to become an opinion. It still has to get its details. It still has to be experimented with. It has to go through that whole process.\n\nThe other side is: The potential to recognize but the urge to force the timing. People who have this detriment always want to give you the answer at the wrong time. You are busy and they have the answer and they won't let you do your thing. They have to give you the answer when you do not appreciate it, and then it does not get shared properly. The first line knows very little about the other side. The key in all of this is to recognize the nature of timing, to be ready in the understanding and then you do not get punished."

      "line": 2,
      "hd_title": "Acceptance",
      "full_text": "Here, we get to the line of projection and we know with the projection that there is no introspection in that process. The introspection is all about timing. When you go to the tantric channel of this, you get to the 15/5. You get to being in the flow; you get to the Rhythm. You get to the timing mechanism. Timing is at the core of giving answers. When you get to the second line, the projection line, there is no introspection to recognize the nature of the timing.\n\nThe line of Acceptance. The recognition of limitation in oneself and others leads to tolerance and the suspension of judgment. Moon exalted. The glorification of feelings. The mother which always pardons the errant child. Mars in detriment. The assertion of the ego at the expense of others' failures.\n\nIn the white book, the Moon exalted. The potential to recognize that not everyone can understand. The first thing that happens to the person that is projecting out their answer and not being aware of the timing is that they project out their answer and other people just don't get it. They are not ready for it. It is not the right time. It is not the right moment. It is not the right place. Because of that, they have the sense of \"They don't understand me. Why don't they understand me?\" Then there is this sense of \"Maybe they will. It is too bad that they do not understand.\" There is this sense of \"Poor them. I have to be patient with them,\" instead of realizing that it is simply coming at the wrong time.\n\nThe other side is: The potential to take advantage of the lack of understanding in others. Here we have the ability to see very clearly in the projection that the others do not understand. \"If they don't understand I will take advantage of the understanding.\" In other words, \"If they don't get it, I won't share it with them. I'll just do it myself.\" Usually, disaster and Terminal disease follow."

      "hd_title": "Irresponsibility",
      "full_text": "The third line is about adaptation. We get to the end of the trigram. The third line is rooted in the wave of bonds made and broken. I have my design Saturn in this line and I know it very well. It is called Irresponsibility. I claim it boldly: \"I am not responsible.\" The general refusal to apply oneself diligently when one can get by with much loss effort. This is a deep facility to be able to come up with answers and give them to other people.\n\nVenus exalted. Where art is more valued than the artist. Understanding and collecting answers was something for me that I did, but I never applied them to my life. I just collected answers. That's all. It did not make any difference to me what it would mean to me personally. I was just collecting answers because that is what the 4.3 can do.\n\nPluto in detriment. The rationalization of irresponsibility as an act of refocalization. They need to collect these answers for whatever reason.\n\nThe potential to enjoy the formulas with no regard to their practical application. None. It is just a matter of having answers. The other side of this is: The potential to justify such a process in order to maintain it, which is a lovely thing to do. I have been doing that all of my life. Fortunately, now I do something with them. It is a very funny trait."

      "hd_title": "The Liar",
      "full_text": "We reach the upper trigram and get to the resonance of the first line, the Pleasure and the timing process. Here you have The Liar. Role playing as an art form. The actor.\n\nSun exalted. Fantasy protects and nurtures a sense of purpose and reason, no matter how misguided. Saturn in detriment. Time always brings humiliation. Here, time is mentioned again. You play the game of having the answer. Let's say you are sitting in an office and your boss walks by and says, \"By the way, do you know how to run the 41762 machine?'\" and you say, \"Yes\". It is your role to say yes and you play out that role. If you do not really know, you will have to find out how it works very quickly from somebody else before the boss says, \"Did you get it done?\" Often, time will bring humiliation.\n\nThis is pretending to understand, which can be wonderful. It can be very artistic. It helps to be able to explain an understanding if what you are pretending to understand is really something you do understand.\n\nThe potential to find or illustrate the formulas through fantasy. What really happens to these people is that they are driven (Youthful Folly, yes, I know) to figure it out. This is their way of getting to understand. First they lie and then they run like hell to catch up with their lie. Every once in a while they get caught up in the game.\n\nThe other side is: The potential danger to see the fantasy as fact. This is because the moment you say, \"I know how to run the 41762 machine,\" and the boss says, \"Okay, show me,\" you are in big trouble."

      "line": 5,
      "hd_title": "Seduction",
      "full_text": "Here we come to a real key to the nature of what the whole logical process is about. The fifth line is a line of universalization and the fifth line wave has to do with the nature of seduction. This fifth line is called Seduction. It is one of the things to recognize about the nature of the logic system (and I can't repeat it too often) that you have three gates of the logic system in the throat. The 62nd, the 31st and the 16th gate are not pointed towards a motor. It is enormously difficult for logic to find its energy. One of the keys to that is the capacity to be able to seduce that energy. \"Would you please finance my experiment?\" That is a very difficult thing to do in this world. There are millions and millions of people trying to get somebody to finance their experiment so that they can prove something and bring their solution.\n\nThe nature of seduction in terms of the logic process is the universalizing element of answers. An answer that has universal potential is deeply seductive. When you are looking at these fifth lines of potential, I hope you get the image of them that they are deeply spiritual or religious. We saw the fifth line, The Saint, in the abstract process, The Confessor in the individual process, and here you come to The Seducer. Remember, at the other end, you have a black magic gate in the same circuit. The seduction is: \"I have an answer for you but you have to provide me with some energy, and then I will give it to you.\"\n\nAllowing others to assume responsibility as a shield against potential punishment. You have to get them to understand so that they will take the chance with the experiment, so that they will bring the energy to it. More than any other of those lines, this line recognizes that the answer will only work if there is energy.\n\nJupiter exalted. Unearned reward and recognition. Pluto in detriment. A life of lip service to antiquated and unsatisfying values. Cynicism. This is the cynicism that says, \"I am the one that has the answer, and I have to go around seducing people to try to get the energy.\" What I call the money lenders. You have to go out into this world. I can remember, in the days before my work was published, what it was like to go to publishers and have them laugh at me. They told me that I was just bananas.\n\nThe potential to succeed through the understanding of others. Logic is a collective process and it is about sharing, and it is deeply important to understand others. Again, it goes back to the 18th gate and the resonance to that other potential that is about human rights. It is about recognizing that the real answer for humanity is very important.\n\nThe potential for cynicism that comes with always having to acknowledge the understanding of others. They have to understand you in order that you can get your understanding out. These people can be very bitter. The dull thing is when it stops there at the 4th gate because whoever gets it to the throat gets all the credit. Whoever speaks the voice of that opinion in detail is the one that gets the credit and not the seducer in the 4th. Those who speak it in the throat and the understanding is refuted is the one that gets punished, not the seducer."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Excess",
      "full_text": "Here you get to the sixth line, to the roof of the house and this line of transition. This is actually a very fascinating line because these people do want to understand. They are not interested in answers. They know how easy answers are. They are very aware of that. They tend to be people who, for example, as students have an enormous difficulty learning this. They have difficulties in bothering to understand at all. They are looking for something else. They are looking for the next line which is the 29.1, The Abysmal, the gate of saying yes, and the gate of making a commitment to a process. It is actually making a commitment to life itself. These people say, \"The answer does not matter but life matters. I do not care what your guru says. I am happy chopping wood.\" Life matters.\n\nThe line is called Excess. Repeated and conscious abuse of norms will not escape discipline. In refusing to pay any attention to your answers, you can end up in situations where understanding is the only thing that will save you, and you will get punished because you are not ready. You haven't been open to understanding.\n\nMercury exalted. The development through experience of techniques to apply self-restraint. These people do not offer you their answers. They are looking for something else. They are looking for life itself. It is not the answer they are seeking out. The answer doesn't mean anything to them. For them it is just purely intellectual and these are of course very intellectual gates. They are not about what you do. They are just about coming up with formulas and the sixth line knows that. That answer is not what life is about. Life is life.\n\nThe other side of this has Mars in detriment. The gall to accept punishment as the price of excess. \"Well, I don't want to understand so I am not going to school. I will not be what you think I should be. I am more interested in going out and living my life. The answer is not important to me.\"\n\nIn the white book, Mercury exalted. The potential in a logical process to recognize when the understanding is not complete and have the patience to wait out the process. The answer does not mean anything; only life means something.\n\nMars in detriment. Despite recognizing the incompleteness a lack of patience with the process. \"I can't be bothered with all of this. It is not important to me. Where is my life? Do I have a life?\" These are people who always wonder whether they have a life. What is very funny about these people is that, like the 47.6, they are actually ready to go straight down against the circuit to the other side. The 47.6 wants the truth. It is not interested in what makes sense. It is looking to the 17. Can I get an opinion? Will the facts help me?\n\nWhen you come to the 4.6, the logical gate, it is looking for the life. It is looking for an idea. It is ready to cross the circuit, to break the circuit and jump over to the other side. They are both collective, after all, and mirrors of each other. So at the end of their process, they are both looking at each other. One wants to be a believer and one wants to understand. It is quite a nice joke."

      "hd_title": "Love of life",
      "full_text": "The first line always gives you the foundation, the true nature of the hexagram. Here this line has the name Love of Life.\n\nVenus exalted. The very stimulation of the world is the basis of an aesthetic appreciation of its beauty and wonder. Alone or shared with others, this profound inner realization is the key for a joyous harmony with the process of being. How nice) The Moon in detriment is the very same thing, only that it is inconsistent.\n\nThe Moon will bring phases in which this love of life is there. Please keep in mind that this is not aware. The energy is literally the fuel of vitality. This is the energy that says, \"Being alive is great,\" but the risks in life are terrible. Without this vitality, this pure love for what it is just to be filled with life itself, there is not sufficient energy to deal with correction. This is the fuel for the channel of Judgment. This is all about the fuel to challenge authority, and the love of life is to challenge any authority in which the pattern is incorrect. Because it is so difficult to bring logic to manifestation, this energy is so stimulated by life (the other side) that it really has within it the potential to offer this energy so that correction can take place.\n\nMost frustrating for 58's is when there is no 18, to recognize within oneself that there is this energy of this vitality to get life to work, to get the pattern right, but no idea where to put the energy. There is no place to put the energy. That can be very frustrating.\n\nIn the white book: The energy which fuels the love of life; or A cyclical energy which intermittently fuels the love of life. It is very important to see clearly that this energy is essential. If you are involved in any kind of logical work, not to have an 18/58 around is going to make it very difficult to go beyond the 'talking' stage to the 'doing' stage. Without this energy, logic gets caught in philosophical debate. We get a committee to study a certain proposal and a subcommittee to study a sub-proposal and the sub- subcommittee to study the proposals of the committees, and a financial committee to study the possibility of that committee to function properly.\n\nThere is no 58 that says, \"Here is the energy. Let's go and try it.\" Everyone who is involved in a logical process, who does not have the 58, is crying for the same thing. \"If you only give me the money, I will show you that it works.\" Money is just energy. All logical people are running around saying, \"Hey, look, if you finance this project, it will work.\" They are all desperate for that energy. That is why we have this enormous number of committees. We only have one gate that brings this possibility to truly experiment and to see clearly that something can work, and that the challenge of authority has been valid.\n\nThis first line is the essence of what it is to make sure that humanity will have a viable future. There is no viable future without this deep love for the process itself, but this energy points at fear. It is pointed at the awareness that is rooted deeply in fear. The fear that life will fail, that it will not work, that we will be overwhelmed by the broken patterns that will destroy us, that an authority that is misinformed or poorly devised will control us and that it is not going to work. So this vitality needs to have its outlet, in order for experimentation to take place."

      "hd_title": "Perversion",
      "full_text": "Throughout my work in Design I discovered that there are so many people who read lines and find the subject of the lines very uncomfortable and think that their client will find the subject very uncomfortable too. They are really afraid to say anything and they are trying to figure out how to make it nice in order to not to offend their client. The first thing to understand about that is that the moment you think a line is negative, you (not your client) have a problem because lines are positive and negative, like all things. It is the way it is always going to be. The moment that you cannot see that there is another side, you are not seeing it clearly.\n\nThe second thing is that if you have a line which is uncomfortable and you tell your client about this uncomfortable line, they will just nod their head because it is them. They know that. It is not that you shock them. The fact of the matter is that if you do a reading and you only give people the bad stuff, they are very happy. If you only give them the good stuff, they think that there is something wrong. Most human beings think that everything about them is at fault somewhere, and they are very happy to have negative aspects that they can project on.\n\nLet's look at a classic line, Perversion. We have our prejudices that are alive in the Maya through language, only through language. This is where our prejudices live in all things. Because we are binary and dualistic, we are designed to be prejudiced to be this or that. This is our nature. Understand that a term like 'perversion' carries with it a heavy negative framework. We have given the word 'perverse' an exclusively sleazy sexual connotation. This is part of what we have done to make this word uncomfortable.\n\nWe know what second lines are all about. They project outwards. The 58.2 is projecting outwards, \"I have the energy to enjoy giving this energy to any challenge of authority and any logical experiment.\" What this energy is given to can appear to be very perverse to a lot people.\n\nI have a friend who was with the German network television for forty years and he made his living doing documentaries, and he has the 58.2. During his reading, I got to the 58.2 and told him that this is the line of perversion and he started to giggle. He said: \"Have you ever seen my documentaries?\" He did what was considered a fine documentary on Joseph Beuys, who is pretty perverse himself. He loved it. He did not want to do documentaries about ordinary people that everybody was interested in. Once he was offered to do a documentary on a German politician and he refused it because he considered it boring. He was open to giving this energy, to projecting out that he would give energy, to anything because that is what the second line is all about. It is always ready to project out its capacity. The 58.2 says, \"I will provide energy for any kind of process.\" What happens to these people is that they get offered a lot of weird things because they project out that they are open to anything.\n\nSometimes they are paper tigers and they do not go through with it; they don't really like giving their joyous energy for that. Due to the projection, they often (logical people are desperate for that energy) get all kinds of people that never had access to energy before because they do not meet 58.2's every day. Thus, the 58.2 ends up providing their energy for unusual different forms of challenge to authority.\n\nIt is our social morals because the collective stream is deeply moralistic. It knows what is right and wrong. This is a judgmental channel and, therefore, these people get judged as being perverse. Why do you give your energy to buy shoes, when you can feed starving babies? It is not about making a judgment about these people because they have this line. The moment that you explain to them what it is doing, telling them, \"You are projecting out that your energy is available, and you get all kinds of people that bring strange things for you to put your energy to,\" they understand that because that is what their life has been about.\n\nMany of them get hooked on that because they get the outlet, they get their opportunity to see their energy move through. All the other logical people that are not getting access to energy start making judgments and say, \"Why did you do that? You could do this and that with me. Why are you so perverse? I need your energy to do this that is so healthy and logical.\" Don't get caught up in being judgmental about the name of a line. Just see it for what it is. There are some great creative forces that are rooted in the 58.2. Without them, the collective would be very poor. We would only have committees for building roads."

      "hd_title": "Electricity",
      "full_text": "When we get to the third line, we get to the end of the lower trigram and to the line of trial and error. We know that it is a learning process, a moving process. The line is called Electricity. Uranus exalted. The individual whose electric vitality creates its own stimulation and is not dependent on others.\n\nIf you look above the lines it says: Stimulation is the key to joy. The stimulation comes from being able to release the energy and challenge authority: only then, which means that, in the first three lines, it is always difficult because they do not really know that there is something on the other side. They just have this energy within them.\n\nThe Uranian aspect of this is: The energy to fuel independent stimulation. These are people that won't give you access to this energy to experiment, unless it is their experiment. They are not aware. They don't really know that there is another side and that the awareness is at the other side.\n\nThere are so many people like that. You have somebody who has a lot of resources, such as wealth, and they have somebody who comes to them and says, \"I have this great idea. Could you help me out?\" Even if it is a great idea for them, they will say \"No. I have my own idea that I am working on.\" In other words, they want to do their own thing. They make a lot of mistakes that way because this is a collective process and logic is deeply interdependent in its collectivity. It is essential.\n\nOn the other side of this line is Mars in detriment. The quality of fire is dependent on its fuel and subject to its influence, good or bad. Here you can see where immaturity has a value. Because this is the immature aspect of this line, they end up being dependent on others anyway, to be able to get it out. They have to.\n\nThe energy for aliveness that is dependent on others for stimulation. They recognize very early that they can't get it out without others. The exalted, the Uranian side, is stubborn about that. It wants to do its own thing. Every time that you are looking at logic, remember that logic's expression from the G center to the throat is called The Alpha. Because The Alpha is intrinsic in the logical process, built into this third line is an essential element that says, \"Even though we have a collective, it still must be lead by an Alpha. The 58.3 exalted wants to be an Alpha. It does not simply want to be the one who is the follower who provides the energy. It wants to be the Alpha that leads."

      "hd_title": "Focusing",
      "full_text": "The fourth and fifth lines in the upper trigram are inherently social. That is, they are well aware that there is a gate at the other end of the channel. When you come to the fourth line, which is a line of externalization, we have a very fixed energy and the line is appropriately titled Focusing. It is a pure focus of this energy available for experimentation. Whenever you deal with the 58, always think of it as the energy for experimentation. Ultimately it is all about that. It is important to keep that in mind. The energy is really for being able to experiment with a pattern that challenges authority, but nonetheless, a pattern that must be supported through this energy.\n\nHere we have Pluto exalted. A natural specialization that when confronted with a multiplicity of stimulation will have no inner difficulty in focusing on the appropriate influence. It is quite obvious. In other words, these people being unidirectional, with their single-mindedness, have the ability in them to energize or to bring about experimentation but in a very fixed, limited, narrow way. They do not want to give their energy to this or that challenge of authority; they are very clear that it has to go in one direction.\n\nIn the white book: The energy to fuel recognition of which stimulation is of value. \"I don't want to give my energy to that.\" It is not like the third line saying, \"This is my thing.\" This is simply willingness to give its energy to the appropriate pattern, to the appropriate experimentation.\n\nNeptune in detriment. An impressionability that becomes confused with a multiplicity of stimulations and in trying to accommodate all of it becomes unstable. This is obvious for any fourth line. If you have a fourth-line mind, if you are trying to juggle eight or nine different mental processes, you will become mentally unstable because fourth lines are about being fixed and about being single -tracked and one-minded. The only way in which that externalization can take place is if it is fixed in that way.\n\nWhen you come to the detriment of this line, there is so much pressure on the people who have this pressure gate to provide their energy to relieve their pressure. There is enormous pressure on 58's because the logic system starves for energy. The people with the detriment get suddenly overwhelmed because so many people want to get access to their energy and in trying to go from here to there, back and forth, they become unstable. They do not become mentally unstable; they become physically sick. This energy is pointed towards the splenic system.\n\nLook carefully at the fourth lines that you have and be very clear what a fourth line is saying to you. It tells you that you have to have a single focus, a single track. That is what keeps a fourth line healthy."

      "hd_title": "Defense",
      "full_text": "The fifth line is always being projected on. Due to that, it represents how society, how a culture as a whole will look at this particular hexagram. It is interesting enough to see that this line is called Defense. People are always projecting onto the 58.5 that they have the energy to provide a stimulation, that they have the energy that can bring about the experimentation. Because of that, they are approached a lot.\n\nMoon exalted. The natural and practical instinct to protect oneself, regardless of temptations. Built into the genetic material of this fifth line (remember that fifth lines are lines of universalization) is the recognition that only those experiments that can be universalized are worthy of one's energy. Otherwise, they are not.\n\nIn the white book: The fuel for self-defense, regardless of stimulations. Self-defense is really about fending people off who are trying to tap into that energy.\n\nSun in detriment. The assumption that the best defense is a good offense that might allow strength of character to enjoy questionable stimulus without succumbing to it. Or, in terms of the white book: The energy for aliveness which forsakes self-defense and will embrace questionable stimulations. There is always this risk for 58's that something is so interesting as a stimulation (this is the resonance to Perversion) that they will give up their self-defense and try it. That never means that the results of that will be bad. It does not. It is not about that. It simply is a mechanism. After all, it is a fifth line. Whether it is working this way or that way, both ways have value because everything that can be experimented with is of value in the end to all of us. That is why we have a scientific community that spreads across the world and that has millions and millions of people involved in all different kinds of experimentation.\n\nUltimately, the totality benefits from the availability of all of that knowledge and all of that affirmation of what kind of patterns work or not.\n\nThe thing to recognize about the 58.5 is that it will fend people off and say, \"No.\" There is all this projection on them saying, \"They are the ones that can give you the juice you need.\" So they learn very early. Remember what it is to be a 58.5 child and have projected on you that you are the one that has the energy to get things fixed and corrected, experimented with. You can get into all kinds of stuff that is not for you.\n\nThe terms 'exalted' and 'detriment' do not mean anything. They just say that there are two sides. The plan is logical. Our genetic code is logical. The binary process of evolution is logical, the logic that generates patterns which are all by their very nature hierarchical. This is one of the things to understand about what the logical collective process is for us. That is what establishes the hierarchy in life. It literally establishes how the hierarchy works in the sense that, when you see that the identity comes out of the Alpha, you also have to realize that that is a binary which consists of a leader and a follower. That binary exists in everything, whether it is the parent and the child, or the employer and the employee. Wherever you are looking, we have hierarchical structures that are built into your pattern process. It is inherent in that."

      "hd_title": "Carried Away",
      "full_text": "When you come to the sixth line, you come to the resonance to the third line, and what we saw in Electricity was that there is a built-in Alpha field. The exalted says, \"I want to be the leader,\" and the other side of that is, \"I have to give my energy anyway, so I will be a follower, just to get my energy out.\" These are the two sides of the third line. They are not about good or bad. When you come to the sixth line, to the potential of wisdom, to the transition, to what is beyond, it is looking to the whole circuit. It says, \"I am looking at the whole circuit and therefore I will not give my energy to anything other than what is going to be experimented with and proved, to what will become part of the pattern and the flow of society and the format, the focus, of how we operate, and that is something that society is going to be led into, guided by their leaders.\" That is quite a vision.\n\nHere we have Carried away. The Moon exalted. The tendency to practicality that while thoroughly enjoying external stimulation has the instinct to draw back when its independent integrity is threatened. Here is your classic sixth line that says, \"No, why should I give my energy to that kind of experiment? I will only waste my money and my time.\"\n\nWhen you are looking at the lunar side, The energy to fuel independent integrity that will maintain its identity in times of stimulation, you are looking at, \"I will only involve my energy in this correction, in this challenge, in this experiment, if I am the alpha, if I can maintain my independent integrity. I am not going to be a follower. If I am a follower, I will not be involved. So don't ask me for anything unless you want my money to build a business. That is okay, but I have to be the boss. Otherwise, I will not give you the money.\"\n\nYou come to the Mercury in detriment: When its basic intelligence is effectively stimulated, its natural desire for attunement will lead it to identify so strongly with the stimulation, that it is at risk of losing is identity. When people read this line and come to 'losing one's identity', they get very nervous. It is okay. It is not bad. If we did not have these people, we would have no dedication.\n\nIt is essential that we also have this other side: The energy which fuels loss of identity in times of stimulation. That leads to the identification that ends up being what we call skills. The 16th gate at the top of this stream is the great gate of Identification. If you cannot identify with your art, you are not an artist. In the East they always say, \"Do not identifyl\" Well, in Human Design we say, \"Don't identify with identification.\" But the identification is there. This stream is about identification. If you really manage to stimulate a 58.6, they will give up everything for the cause. They will give up everything for the experiment, for that identification because that leads to great art and great changes in all kinds of things.\n\nBut to get the 58.6 on either side, the leader or the follower side, to actually commit their energy, that is another story. Like all sixth lines, they are standing back and saying, \"Yes, but my energy is only for that experiment that is truly going to be productive, and that truly is of benefit to society.\"\n\nBoth sides of the sixth line, whether they are the leader or the follower, are essential ingredients because they will bring mutation to the logical collective. When they commit themselves to something, that is a very important commitment of energy but do not count on them to do that. They are not the 58.2 that is standing there and saying, \"I am ready. What do you want? You need energy for this or that?\" That is not the sixth line.\n\nSee clearly that built into everything that is logical, built into its very energy is this division between those who lead and those who follow. It is always there because this is where the hierarchy is empowered. A final thing to remember about the 58th gate: you have only two fuel gates for the logical process out of the root center, the 52 and the 58. They are in opposition in the zodiac and they are part of the same cross. This is a very powerful force that operates through this polarity. You have to clearly see the importance of the 58. It has to be encouraged to participate in the logical process. There is no question about that. We need their energy in order to properly, and in a healthy way, challenge authority."

      "full_text": "Please remember about the 55.6, the line in the 55 that will awaken to the spirit, its next step is to the 37.1. That is the transition this line is looking for. The first thing about mutation in the individual, in terms of the spirit, is that the first place it has to go is directly into the tribe, into the line of the Mother/Father as a mutation into the family, into the tribe itself.\n\nA position of inherent respect that ensures a focus for the development of guidelines. Venus exalted. Harmony is the key to the successful maintenance of relationships. It is only through harmony that the beauty and the values of the family can endure. Look, this is a foundation line. There is no polarity. It is very straight forward. This is what the family is all about.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: Friendship that is rooted in sensitivity and ensures harmony. It has to be rooted in the sensitivity to the legitimate bargain, in the touch. I make fun of the bargain but, please understand that it is natural. The thing is that it has to be a clean bargain. All clean bargains are of value. The whole thing with the beginning of this process is to recognize that the first thing that the spirit mutation will do is that it has to go to the mother and father and it has to be instilled as a value within the family as a guideline. This will be its step.\n\nWhat friendship is all about is that everything having to do with friendship has to do with sensitivity. Sensitivity is a word that simply says resources. The selfishness in the 55.6 leads to the family and the resources."

      "hd_title": "Responsibility",
      "full_text": "When you get to the second line, you get to projection. In getting to the second line, the projection is Responsibility. This is the ashram line. It has Jupiter exalted. The understanding of the principle of individual responsibility as the foundation for successful cooperation. That is, \"We all do it, but everybody does their thing.\" Whenever people have this line, I always tell them, \"You can't be in relationships or friendships in which other people are dependent on you because you will always end up being the other side of this line, which is telling them what they should do: to be responsible.\"\n\nMercury in detriment. A tendency to point out the responsibility of others. This is a natural ashram line. You have all these people in an ashram that are responsible for themselves in the cooperation and you have somebody who is on the other side of this line always telling them where they should be responsible. You have both sides at the same time.\n\nThe heading above the lines says: The manifestation, macro- and micro-cosmically, of the organic nature of communities. This projection is not about family at all. It is about being in the family. It is not about being of the family. It is about projecting into the family. This is projection and it does not have the introspection to recognize the true guidelines or values, or the nature of the family. It simply knows that it has to belong somewhere in order to get its resources."

      "hd_title": "Evenhandedness",
      "full_text": "When you get to the third line, the end of the lower trigram, you get to line of adaptation, to the line of bonds being made and broken, to the wave of allegiance and rejection. So we know that in that sense there will be an irresponsibility in relationship to the nature of the family.\n\nIt is called Evenhandedness. The success of any group is dependant on maintaining order. Jupiter exalted. The ability to judge what behavior is appropriate and to react in a balanced manner to transgressions. 'What behavior is appropriate' is the behavior that will bring the resources that are necessary. Always remember that. So, this is the attempt to adapt in order to make sure that one can get the resources that are necessary.\n\nMars in detriment. An ironic tendency to either test incessantly the borders of acceptability or to respond to the very same tendency in others with severity. All of this is about trying to adapt to a situation in order to get to the resources. The rules can be changed in that, remember, bonds made and broken. This is the one where everybody has to behave in a certain way and then all of a sudden the situation changes and everybody has to behave differently. We have to change the way the family works because the conditions have changed. This can be very destabilizing.\n\nIn the Book of Letters we have: The possibility to have the sensitivity to know what behavior is appropriate in a relationship. In order to get the resources: don't forget to add that. It is very important to keep that in mind. It is not simply about behavior. This is not Grace. This is not behavior to set up a situation where mutation can take place. This is behavior that is designed to get a return. It is looking for resources.\n\nThe other side: The possible lack of sensitivity to what behavior is appropriate. These are people that will change their behavior simply because it is a way for them to get access to resources that they wouldn't get behaving the way they did before. They can feel very insensitive to those people that were there with them while they were in that behavioral mode. These people can end up being the kind of people that other people will complain about. They are always changing or breaking the rules, or they punish you because you broke the rules, the very rules that they break. Remember that the 37 is going up and down in the hope and pain wave. Add that to everything that we are saying."

      "hd_title": "Leadership by example",
      "full_text": "We get to the upper trigram and we get to the externalization, to the one-track. We get to Leadership by example. Any member of the family may take on a leading role through exemplary behavior. 'Exemplary behavior' is getting the resources. This is so important to understand. The community cannot survive without the resources. The 37, which recognizes the principles that is has received from the 19/49 process, knows that it is its responsibility to attract the ego force that will fulfill those resources. Any member of the family can take on this leadership role if they can figure out how to get the resources.\n\nMoon exalted. The manifestation of highest principles in everyday and practical affairs. The higher principles are making sure that the family is looked after. This is not selfish, please understand that. It is for the nature of the family. It is selfish in the 55.6, when it is individual. When it gets to the 37.1, this is for the family. This is making sure that there is enough for the children to eat; there is enough money to build a school.\n\nSaturn in detriment. A conservatism that generally only accepts the leadership of the father who may or may not be a valued role model. 'The father', in that sense, can be the father in the patriarchy and the mother in the matriarchy. It makes no difference. It is only about accepting the way to get material and the resources based on a traditional archetype.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The possibility of the highest principles in all relationships resulting in a leadership role. The moment that you can provide for your family, you take on a leadership role. There are so many families in which the traditional bread winner, the father, is replaced by a child that is successful. It is normal in that sense that they take on the leadership role because they have the power. The power for the family is where the resources are.\n\nThe possibility of being insensitive to the leadership of anyone other than those accepted by tradition. \"You can bring more money into the house than the father does, but I will still honor my father instead of you. He will tell me what the guidelines are.\" Remember, at the foundation of the family are the guidelines. So, these families come into conflict. The conflict arises between the one that has traditional leadership and the one that actually has the pocket book. It is a lot of tension in families. I am not just talking about blood families. I am talking about any kind of community, any kind of relationship that you have with friends. The situation is: who actually has the role and who actually has the power? The power is in the resources."

      "hd_title": "Love",
      "full_text": "This universalization line has such a lovely name. It is called Love. Natural and unaffected devotion to the family. Always remember that fifth lines are about seduction. This is the great seduction of community, family and affection, which is love. This is a nice seduction, isn't it?\n\nVenus exalted. Natural harmony and perfected sharing. Mars in detriment. Emotional dependency that often turns love into hatred. This is an interesting line. When you look at the Book of Letters, you have the Venusian aspect which says: Natural harmony and sharing possible through friendship. This is what has to be universalized in the family. What is being offered in this 'harmony and sharing' is the non-revealed wave that is underneath. This harmony and sharing goes from hope to pain and back again. That is not part of the billing. The billing is, \"I am your friend. I am affectionate with you. We will have harmony together. Can I seduce you with that?\" And the other side is saying, \"Seduce me with that.\" Then the wave comes along. It will create all kinds of dilemmas.\n\nThe other side is: The possibility of dependency turning love into hate. This is very important. It is milder for the person who has it than for the one who doesn't. This is all about the emotions. We can never escape the fact that we have the solar plex center here. These people are offering their love and their harmony for what the ego will deliver on the other side. If they become dependent on that ego, if they keep on offering this perfect affection in order to get their bread and butter, they will quickly develop a hate for that ego at the other end. Even more so: these people that carry this line make other people emotionally dependent on them. By doing so, they create the potential for hatred in the other person because most of those people are undefined emotionally and are being yanked up and down on that emotional wave.\n\nIn all this talk of the sweetness of love, you also have to recognize that the family always has its love but it is never something that stays at one place. It is always going up and down in the wave. We all know this in our families and communities. This breeds all kind of dependencies and it says that this is the universalized methodology. This is: \"Get them dependent on the emotional wave\". Out of this can come hatred. Hitler had this line in an undefined emotional center."

      "hd_title": "Purpose",
      "full_text": "The 37.6 carries a unique significance. There are six waves of spirituality, the six mystical waves. This is a movement that goes from the 19 to the 49, from the 37 to the 40, from the 51 to the 25, and from the 20 to the 10, the three mystical channels bridged by the 40/37. At the mystical level, the 37 is looking for a family that is far beyond the mundane. At the mystical level, it is looking for God. This is a gate that yearns for something very profound. One of the extraordinary things about the 37.6 is that it leads to the 63.1. It leads to After Completion; the 63.1 is about the spiral of life.\n\nThe 37.6 is saying, \"What is it all about? Who am I? Where do I belong? Is there something greater that this?\" After all, it is the part that is seeking to be one with the whole. But the whole is more than the family, the group, the nation and the planet. The whole can be transcendent.\n\nIn the 37.6, there is this deep need for God, whatever one wants to call it. Spirituality. To be moved. Within the 37, there is this burning question: what is the purpose? What is the purpose of all this work? What is the purpose of constantly having to look for the resources? What is the purpose of maintaining all this? Is there something greater than all of this? This 37.6 is not just looking for the 40 at the other end. It is far beyond that. It is far beyond the community. It is looking beyond all of that because all of that is just business, and it knows that. There must be something else than just building temples. There must be something beyond all of this material. There must be something beyond just having to feed ourselves. It has to be more than just killing to replenish. It comes out of the 19/49. It knows. There has to be something that raises us up out of the nature around us.\n\nThis perception of 'What is it for?' is the deepest question within the 37.6. Yearning for that. It is not looking to go up to the 21 /45. It is hoping to be able to go the other way so that it can be awakened through initiation, so that it can come to recognize the holiness of its nature, not simply to work in this plane. 70% of all women on earth spend 50% of their time looking for firewood and water, nowl Think of that. What is it about? The nature of the family, in the end, is this yearning for an explanation so that they can see that this trivia in this life is somehow substantiated, that it makes sense. 'Micro- and macrocosm.' This line is called Purpose. The energy to maintain the family is enhanced by recognizing its values. What is it really all about?\n\nVenus exalted. The gift of not only recognizing the inner meaning of the family but an appreciation for its values. Mercury in detriment. A need for diversity that may ignore the achievements of the family in favor of withdrawal. These are the ones that leave the tribe and go looking for God. They are the ones that go on the road and forget about all that stuff. I guess India is the best place to see them, to see the ones that have left their home, that have taken the road to God, whatever they think it may be.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The possibility of extending friendship through the appreciation of its value. But again, for these people, the greatest friendships are the ones that guide them to some kind of spiritual sustenance in their life."

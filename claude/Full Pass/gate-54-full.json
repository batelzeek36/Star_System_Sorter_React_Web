      "hd_title": "Influence",
      "full_text": "This first line is called Influence. It is a strange line if you do not really understand what this gate is all about. The line says: The ability to achieve influence through secret relationships, anywhere from the private adviser to the Satanist. In the white book: Ambition energized through secret relationships which fuel influence. Think about what this really means. If you really want to rise up, you can not just call out and say, \"I want to rise up,\" because there is no way to go. When a 54.1 says, \"I can help you rise up,\" then they get power because of their fuel, their ability to be the adviser, to be the secret one behind the mass. They say to others, \"Do this. Do that.\" In doing that, as the other rises up, they rise with them. As they rise with them, slowly they gain power over the very one that they have been helping to transform.\n\nUnderstand the nature of this 54th gate. The moment that the ambition is for oneself, there is no influence. The ambition has to be pointed towards the other. \"Let me help you. Let me work for you. I really think what you are doing is great. Let me help you out.\" In that, they gain power.\n\nVenus in detriment. A socially misguided insistence on formal recognition of a relationship that in terms of influence will diminish its power. \"I want everybody to know that it was my idea, and not yours.\" Power over. It is gone. If you don't tell anybody, they will eventually figure it out anyway. \"It wasn't really him, it was her.\" That is the power that is inherent here. Ambition which demands formal recognition, limiting influence. The basis of ambition is for the community to succeed. The individual can rise up by helping somebody else and they themselves will gain the influence and eventually rise up."

      "hd_title": "Discretion",
      "full_text": "When we come to the second line, you can see how different a second line can be from a first line. The first line is introspective and it is looking at its foundation. It is looking inward to see how one can truly rise up. It is looking inward to see how we can help somebody else rise up in order to take advantage of that. When you get to the second line, you simply project outwards that you will be discrete. Look at these first three lines, they really tell you so much about ambition. Keep everything secret. Keep everything quiet and closed in. This line is called Discretion. Covert interaction is about not showing it. Don't let them see how ambitious you really are. So, here you have discretion. The energy that these people are projecting outwards is that they will not tell anybody. Of course, that may or may not be true.\n\nSaturn exalted. The wisdom, once a relationship gets formally recognized, to restrain the temptation to take advantage of past informal interactions. \"Yes, your friend is made assistant vice president. But you are not going to remind him in public that in his last job, he was a mess and he covered out so-and-so very nicely.\" You restrain yourself from letting that out so that you can hold on to your power. Otherwise, your ambition will fail. The moment that you are not discrete, you can lose the advantage that you have gained. The energy of restraint fuels ambition.\n\nThe detriment is Mars. It means immaturity. Recognition, in the formal sense, seen as a license to take advantage of informal knowledge. A lack of loyalty. Here is somebody who said, \"Okay, now that I have it formally recognized and everybody knows that it was my idea, I can blow this turkey off and take their place. While we are sitting in this meeting, I will let everybody else know what kind of a fool this person is.\"\n\nLack of loyalty. I make that sound terrible. Don't believe for a moment that we do not need lack of loyalty, like anything else. It is so important to understand that. The person who generated that concept, who was of value to the community and did that informally and gets recognized for it, they feel all right. \"I get recognized for it. Why shouldn't I go on to the next stage, because I have the skills for that?\" After all, this gate is called Ambition. It is others who may consider that a lack of loyalty. This is a projected field. This is the whole thing to understand about this in order that you don't get stuck in these things that we have prejudices about. You can see how they work. This is simply mechanical and we have two sides to this mechanic."

      "hd_title": "Covert interaction",
      "full_text": "Third lines. Bonds made and broken as its frequency. Trial and error as a theme. Here you have the title of Covert interaction.\n\nPluto exalted. The ability, when stymied in formal relationships, to use secret or purely informal channels when it is the only resort. Think about how this works. All of these first three lines carry with them basically the same theme. How this works is that you have somebody that is, for example, working in the military, and they got to a certain rank and then they can't get any further. They get no more formal recognition that they should go higher up in that military order. Because they keep on trying to move the ladder further up and they keep on getting denied, what they do then is that they get involved in covert interaction, in their ambition to find a way to subvert that order. Usually we call that a coup d'etat, and all of a sudden you have a country that is being run by Sergeant Dow. It is not General Dow, not Colonel or Lieutenant Dow, but Sergeant Dow. Remember that it is conditional and only when they are stymied. It does not mean that they will be stymied all the time. In other words, these people will only use covert interaction when blocked.\n\nThe drive when blocked to use secret means to fuel ambition. Most of the time, with the force these people have, they don't get blocked but because it is trial and error, there will be these bonds that are broken in these relationships and it will be necessary to find some other way to get around them in order to continue one's process.\n\nVenus in detriment. The insistence that formal channels, no matter how frustrating, can be overcome by the power of attraction. This, again, goes back to the same thing. This means, using the same military analogy, that even though they get stymied over and over and over again in trying to get the promotion, they will try to make themselves indispensable to the local general. They keep on offering their services, they keep on getting involved, they build up an informal relationship hoping that their very attraction and their very ability to integrate with that person will end up with them finally getting the next step up the ladder, that they think or believe they deserve.\n\nThe energy of ambition when blocked will fuel the power of attraction to overcome the obstacle. If you can't to do it formally, you find some way to ingratiate yourself with the one in charge so that they will accept you at another level, and hopefully that will lead to your ambition being fulfilled. You can see clearly here that we are dealing with a communal supportive process in which the rising up is conditioned on somebody being there to help that process: somebody who gets empowered by these people, somebody who is fueled in their ambition in order that the others' ambition can be realized in the lifetime. It is very powerful. Something to always see in a reading with somebody who has this 54th gate is for them to understand that their greatest success will come by first making somebody else successful.\n\nUltimately, they will get the rewards and the recognition for that energy but it has to be seen second hand. It has to come from others recognizing it, by seeing it, and in its apparent selflessness. \"I did it so that this person could make it.\" They end up being seen as the ones that should be transformed and promoted and moved up the ladder. They are company people and work for the program. They are not just interested in themselves, and they are so pleased when they finally sit in the chairman's seat and they run the organization. The fairy tale associated with this gate is Cinderella. Often, these people have a smell of who they can bribe. They know by instinct with whom covert interactions are possible. They properly smell it, but as a third line, they also make mistakes and learn from them."

      "line": 4,
      "hd_title": "Enlightenment/Endarkenment",
      "full_text": "When you come to this fourth line, it is the only line that is intrinsically different from the traditional I'Ching. That is, in its pure nature obviously there is no description. At the time of the discovery of Uranus, that was when the 54.4 went through its transformation, so we are dealing with something that is just a couple of hundred years old. One of the ways to look at this fourth line is to recognize something about the nature of what we have been looking at in terms of how ambition actually functions. The Marrying Maiden, this ability to rise up, to have this drive and ambition, is always conditioned by a decline of drive and ambition of others, in order for them to rise up. In the externalization of that line lies perhaps the ability to see that one is doing in the world what one would like the world to do for oneself. Do for the totality what you hope the totality will do for you.\n\nThere is this need to recognize that Enlightenment/Endarkenment is not about achieving that for oneself. If one tries to achieve that for others, that is how one finds it. So we have a world filled with priests trying to lead others to the spiritual door so that they can find it. Built into this fourth line is this recognition that enlightenment, or whatever these terms mean, this deep spiritual process, is not about ourselves. It is not our enlightenment or endarkenment. This comes elsewhere. This is about what is possible for the totality because anyone who has this line cannot benefit from it unless they are benefiting from whoever can get it through them.\n\nIf you are a 54.4 and you do somebody's reading, it is more likely that the reading will have a greater impact on you than it has on them because that is the way that will operate. Depending on the person and the situation, you are obviously going to deal with that on a different level. But it is so important to understand that at the core of communal or tribal spirituality is this recognition that there is no reward unless you are serving others, and we have a lot of that in our tribal religion. We have all kinds of people such as missionaries who dedicated themselves to being of service in order to find it themselves."

      "hd_title": "Magnanimity",
      "full_text": "We know that the fourth and fifth lines have the capacity to deal with the other side. They are equipped for it. You notice that both of them are singularities. There is no polarity in these lines. They are very specific. When you get to the fifth line, you know that it is being projected on. So, what we have already learned in the first line about the nature of ambition is that it works best behind the throne. When you get to the fifth line, everybody assumes that the 54.5 is the power behind the throne. They are always given that assumption, even if it is not true. \"They are the ones that are really in charge,\" people say, even if it is not true. Everybody projects on them that they really are the ones in charge. That is why it is called Magnanimity. The way everybody else sees the 54.5 is, \"Isn't that nice. They are willing to help me. How magnanimous of them,\" without the deep recognition that by allowing them to help you, they will go beyond you. They will use you as a way to move up the ladder. When I say 'use you,' I don't mean that in the negative sense.\n\nHere in Magnanimity, the Sun is exalted. The natural authority and actualizing spirit, that in a position of power can have genuine and fruitful relationships with the less advantaged (as long as they are in service and make no demands). That is, if it is not a position of power, it cannot have fruitful relationships.\n\nIn the white book: The energy for actualizing that despite this power fuels fruitful relationships with others. Due to the fact that this person is always projected on to be the power behind the throne, it does not matter what job they have. As long as they are recognized for their power and everybody treats them accordingly, they will continue to give their energy to the people around them who need that energy to keep on succeeding. If they are not given the respect of that power, then all kinds of problems can come out of this because for them it is absolutely essential. They cannot be magnanimous unless they have people around them that are going to respect them and recognize their real power. It is essential for them. As long as that real power is recognized, it is okay.\n\nIf you are the power behind the throne and the king treats you like a god, everything is great. You don't have to be king and you can have a good time with the king who is lesser than you are. And you can have a good time with all those people down there you don't want to deal with because you get that recognition. But if the king treats you like a servant and you have made the king, this will not work. The 54.5 is given a great advantage. It is assumed that they will be the source of power. It is assumed that they are the ones that can help bring about success. Therefore, they will get their opportunities, like all fifth lines."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Selectivity",
      "full_text": "All sixth lines are looking at the nature of the circuit. If you are the Marrying Maiden, and you are looking at the whole circuit and you are a sixth line, you are looking at the 45 which says, \"I am the queen or the king, and I have.\" For any communal sixth line, particularly in the 54.6, the only ambition worth fuelling is an ambition that is going to take them to that place where they are going to be the ruler, and they are going to have that because that is the completion of what this is all about: in doing that and in getting to that place, and being fulfilled in that.\n\nThis line is called Selectivity, and it is about people. After all, we are dealing with community and support. Saturn exalted. The ingrained responsibility, in terms of maintaining security and personal identity, that will naturally restrict its relationships to ones that are mutually beneficial This is very clear. The energy to restrict relationships that hinder ambition. Just because there is somebody that can help, who may be able to get me to here or there does not mean that I will, unless it is mutually beneficial and it is a relationship that is really of value to me that I can enjoy it, and that it is a person that I can work with. This becomes a key at that level.\n\nOn the other side, Jupiter in detriment. A generally benefit and expansive nature that assumes that it can instill what is otherwise missing in its partners. A waste of energy. In the white book: A waste of energy in maintaining relationships which hinder ambition. Let's say, that you have a politician that is running for political office and you have somebody who has the Saturn side. As long as this person is somebody they can work with, as long as it is mutually beneficial, they will get involved in supporting this person but only if they know that if that person gets elected, they are going to get some kind of cushy government job that will pay them a lot in whatever form on the material plane. The Jupiterian side will look at the politician and will think, \"Oh my god. This one will not win but this one has told me that I will get this cushy job, if they do win. So I will do the very best that I can to give them the ambition, the tools and the fuel that they need because I can change them, transform them, so that they can be a winner.\" A waste of energy. That is on the other side.\n\nRemember that we are dealing with a communal sixth line. Communal sixth lines are much more ready to make a commitment than any other of the sixth lines due to the nature of the tribe and community. The thing to recognize about the power inherent in this is that these people really do have a way of climbing the ladder, but it is specifically about whether or not they can grasp and understand the nature of people. This is the most important gift to somebody who has the 54th gate. They have to understand the nature of humans and how they work. This going underneath the secret, the covert, to go deep inside to understand the mechanism of people: What turns them on? What moves them, and what doesn't? What drives them? Because in the end, the great success that is possible only comes as communal success, because this is a tribal stream. It only comes by having those right forces.\n\nIf you are a 54 and you are carrying all this power inside of you to bring about transformation, and the person that offers you that opportunity or the person you connect to does not have what it takes, you will not rise up because they don't rise up. The third line learns this right away. It makes all kinds of mistakes about who it gets involved with. The sixth line, in its wisdom, says, \"I know exactly what kind of person should be there.\" The Saturn restricts everything else but that type. The Jupiter says, \"I know what type it has to be, and I'll turn this person into that type.\" It does not work. When I say that it does not work, that does not work generally. It does not mean that it won't work at all. There are many cases in which the politician has been groomed in that sense. Somebody who really did not have it is groomed by somebody else, so that they really look like they have it.\n\nThe general sense of how it operates in the world is that it tends to be what it is for most sixth lines. They simply withdraw that part of them. When you meet a 54.6, you are not likely to meet somebody who obviously is ambitious. They hold back from ambition until they see the opportunity where they can rise up: either if the person is exactly the right person or because they think, out of the Jupiterian aspect, that they can transform that person and make it the right person."

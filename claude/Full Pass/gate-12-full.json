      "full_text": "Withdrawal that can only be maintained with communal support. Venus exalted. The beauty and harmony possible beyond the reach of temptation. The temptation lies in the solar plex center and in actually committing oneself to trying to explain oneself. Remember, the 12th gate is part of individuality. It is a knowing gate and every time that it makes a social contact, it has to be able to explain itself. If you are away from the social power of the solar plex center, you never have to explain yourself. That can be very peaceful. During that time, one can go through that process, allow the time for mutation to take place and wait for that moment of mood so that it can be externalized.\n\nIn the detriment you have: Simon the Stylite,... These were people in the late Greco-Roman times in the Middle East whose religious practice was to climb up on these very tall pillars and sit up there by themselves. This is about ...total and often absurd withdrawal.\n\nIn the white book: The expression of social withdrawal and its value when supported by others. In other words, if you are a 12 and somebody says, \"Do you want to come and see me now? We have friends in the house,\" and you say, \"I am not in the mood,\" they have to be able to accept that that is your nature so that at some further date, you'll be invited again. That is the need for communal support, in that sense.\n\nThe other side: The absurd expression of social caution and extreme withdrawal from emotional contact. All of this is about bringing mutation. If you are not in the mood, you can't bring mutation. This is the intrinsic lesson of the 12. By the way, you will not be in the mood unless you have a mutation to bring. That is true as well. Mutation for an individual, at its simplest level, is the moment that you can explain an aspect of your knowing that has a mutative value.\n\nThe moment that you can explain your knowing and you are in the mood, that is your opportunity to mutate others and bring them to a new knowing. That is part of how the process works. If somebody has the detriment of the 12.1 in an undefined throat, they may have extreme difficulty in being able to speak. This is a gate of articulation and the 12.1 people with the detriment in an undefined throat can even be mute, or they go through long periods in their life where they do not speak."

      "full_text": "Rigorous withdrawal from negative influences. 'Negative' means from solar plex energy, before one is clear. \"I know I can try, if I am in the mood.\" You can only get to the \"I know I can try\" when you can explain your knowing. That is the moment that the mutative capacity is there.\n\nSaturn exalted. The discipline to maintain a pure state. These are people who really are isolated human beings. They are always projecting out that they are not interested. They always project out that they do not want to have contact with the social aspect at the other end. Of course, they don't know that. This is about social mutation. It is a social channel. Remember, they are a second line so they do not really know what is underneath and how much they may get out of that moment of contact.\n\nMercury in detriment. The boredom that arises out of lack of stimulation. Think about what these people are like. These people are restrained but they don't know why. Somebody says to them, \"Why don't you come out tonight?\" and they answer that they are not in the mood but they don't know if they are really not in the mood. They don't really know why they do not want to go out. They just say, \"I am not in the mood.\" That is what they can put out all the time as a protective vibration. \"I am not in the mood. I am not ready. I don't want to.\" But they do not really know why. They can get very confused by that.\n\nIn the white book: The expression of disciplined social caution; or Caution that manifests boredom and the expressed desire for stimulus. These people constantly say, \"No\", but then they get very bored. We are dealing with a social channel here. There is a part of them that says, \"Yes, but what am I going to do? I keep on going like this. There is nobody here.\" There is this sense of boredom that builds up underneath because they are not working on the mutative process.\n\nThey are not coming up with their explanation for their knowing. That is the only moment that the 12 is free. It is a gate of articulation, literally, to be able to express the mutation. That means that you really have to be able to explain yourself, to bring it out into a social context. I am a classic 12.1. 1 have both my conscious and unconscious Uranus there. I did not go out into the world with the Human Design System until I was very clear about it. I lived like a monk, totally isolated, and the community supported it. These are classic patterns that go on all the time."

      "full_text": "The process of self-analysis. Neptune exalted. Whenever you see Neptune exalted, you know that you have quite a process to cut through all that murk, that it is not a clear process. The recognition of inadequacies and the purging of unjustified vanities. Every time this person makes contact, it is necessary for them to explain themselves. Remember that an individual has no business being social unless they can explain themselves. If they can't, they will get into a lot of trouble socially because, not only will they be rejected, but they will have to deal with the wave on the other side. What happens to these people is that they put that energy out and then they discover their inadequacies and they begin an adaptive process of learning. After all, if these people get through this process in a relatively healthy way, they have an enormous knowing within them about what really works and when they can bring out this quality of knowing within themselves.\n\nMars in detriment. A perverse and often exaggerated self-hatred. I have met a lot of 12.3's who are so heavy on themselves. If you are a person like that, that is okay, but if you identify with being heavy on yourself, this is a tragedy. It takes years, 40 to 50 years, to go through all of this trial and error and to get to the point where you really can put across that explanation socially as a stranger and bring your mutation to others.\n\nIn the white book: The expression of inadequacies in social interaction that leads to self-analysis and caution; or Inadequacies in social interaction that leads to the expression of self-hatred. You can't cure these people of their selfhated. It is not like you can say to them, \"Now look, you have the 12.3 in detriment and it is a mechanic for your hating yourself, but do not take it seriously.\" That is very difficult to do.\n\nThe thing for them to recognize about the nature of that is that there is a conditioning factor in this line in the black book: A perverse and often exaggerated self-hatred. This means not always. It does not say 'always' which means that it is not fixed. This is the only thing that can work for them, to see out of that self -hatred that their failure of social interaction is not about them being inadequate. It is about them not having contact with the right forces. Again, it is a third line. It is not transpersonal. It really does not understand the emotional system on the other side and can only learn through experience, and usually painful experience."

      "full_text": "The ability to foresee and plan for the end of standstill. They are people that have the ability to foresee. They have been waiting all along and have the capacity inside of them to know exactly when the mood is right and to know exactly when they have the capacity to explain themselves. After all, what good are prophets when they cannot explain themselves?\n\nEarth exalted. The rousing of the stagnant for communal preparation. In the white book: The ability to foresee and express the need for social interaction and an end to caution. It is time to get the word out. It is time to get this mutation going because, without the emotional energy, it is not going to happen.\n\nOn the other side, Mercury in detriment. The voice in the wilderness. In the 12.1, we have people that can have extreme difficulties in articulation and they can even be mute. In the fourth line, you have people with speech impediments. You have people who have difficulty in the way they articulate. 'The voice in the wilderness': it may be very hard for these people to speak. These are people that can stutter. These are people that can go through all kinds of difficulties in terms of articulation.\n\nThe expressed need for social interaction that falls on deaf ears. It is very hard for these people to get their message across. Everything about the externalization process is about opportunity. Prophets show up exactly at the right time: when people are ready to hear their word. Otherwise, it does not work. This is about being totally fixed on that moment, waiting for that moment to be able to externalize one's explanation, one's mutation, and to try to bring about some kind of social transformation."

      "hd_title": "The Pragmatist",
      "full_text": "The success of restraint lies in not abandoning the lessons learnt when the phase ends. This immediately tells you something about this line: it is not like the second line. It really knows what is on the other, side and that the emotional energy comes and goes. It knows that each time that the energy is there, there is a period afterwards in which they are going to be alone and they stand still and they go through their process but they also know: that experience of the emotional system is coining again and they are ready for that.\n\nIt is also projected onto these people that they are much more social than they are. Jiirgen is a classic example with the 12.5 and 22.5, a resonance in this channel. It is always projected on him that he is very social and accessible, but I know him very well. I know that when you hook into that, it will come out, but it is not necessarily the case.\n\nThis is a projected field that people put onto others. What is so important about this fifth line is that, because they always get this social projection placed on them, they get a lot of experience. If they are clear each time about the nature of that experience, they finally are people who have very special social skills because they know when to be in the mood and how to interact when they are in the mood.\n\nSun exalted. Light is always conscious of darkness. Mars in detriment. The tendency to remember only the most painful lessons learnt. This side of that energy can be, \"Yes, I learned a lot about this social interaction but there is a lot in it that I don't really like.\" They get to see that the social mechanism of the individual is not always pleasant, even if you can explain yourself. There are forces that are not worth dealing with.\n\nIn the white book: Caution as an expression of social experience; or Caution which is conditioned by the most painful social experiences. One of the things about fifth lines is that if you really get to them, they remember the most painful lesson. They remember that type of hook and then they are able to say no and be very cautious out of that experience because it was painful. It does not mean that it was harmful to them or bad. It is simply that they will always remember what did not work and they will not get involved with that again because they are by their very nature cautious, regardless of how social they are."

      "hd_title": "Metamorphosis",
      "full_text": "Faith in, and energy applied towards change and emergence from standstill.\n\nSun exalted. Creative transcendence that, when connected to the harmonic gate 22 through the channel of Openness, leads to successful mutation and the emergence of a new social form; or A retrograde metamorphosis that has evolved a perfected adaptation to standstill. This is typical of the sixth line. Here you have the potential for real mutation, the mutation of the social form itself. This mutation has not come yet. We have minor mutations of the social form, but the real major mutation has not come yet. This sixth line is always waiting for this mutation.\n\nNot only are they less likely to be social, they are less likely to be cautious. They don't care about either of those things. What they really care about is what is the mutation and what will it do? The next gate is the 15, which is the love of humanity and it is on the path to leadership. What can it do for humanity? Is this social mutation going to be of value to the totality? This is so important to all sixth lines. They have to see that something can really be It'.\n\nThe capacity to mutate and express new social forms. This is always inherent in the 12.6. It means that if you have that kind of energy, it is always possible for you, through your explanation, to bring a real change in the way in which people deal with each other. In bringing out this mutative energy, this is what slowly begins to change everything. Without mutation, there is no real change.\n\nWhen you come to the other side: The perfected adaptation to caution that can accept social limitations. These are people that will just stand back forever and say, \"That is the way it is and nothing is going to change that. Why should I get involved? Why should I go through all the pain of dealing with their emotional wave to try to get them to a point where they can really be clear about what I am explaining to them? It is just not worth it because they are too confused and we will never get this thing to work out.\"\n\nWhereas the exalted of the 12.6 recognizes deep inside that it has a genetic capacity to change the emotional system, this line will truly be a metamorphic line in the moment that the solar plex center starts its actual mutative change. All of that will be expressed through this stream. But, like all sixth lines, you have to recognize that the nature of that is to be an example for others. The deepest thing that lies within the individual is, \"Whatever I am presenting as an explanation, it has to be a valid example for others or they are going to stone me, or they will see me as a hypocrite if they can't understand it. Then they will think that I am not telling them something that is valid or true.\" The 12.6 is deeply cautious but at the same time, there is magic in it because it can bring deep mutation to humanity."

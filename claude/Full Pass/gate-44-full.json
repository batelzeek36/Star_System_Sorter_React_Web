      "hd_title": "Conditions",
      "full_text": "Whenever you are dealing with first lines, you are dealing with the keynote of introspection. We know that this is the foundation of the hexagram and this first line is a classic example of what a foundation really means because it establishes the basic nature of what Coming to Meet is all about. This is one of the four ways. It is called Conditions. It says, The establishment of frameworks as the result of interaction. This is what surrender is all about: it has to take place within a specific framework. Here is this transformation we want to bring about. Here is the framework of how it gets done.\n\nPluto exalted. A mastery of the collective that can establish restrictive conditions for inferior components with the ability to enforce them. Think about that. This is the foundation of this hexagram. It starts with the mastery of the collective. This is very important to understand.\n\nThis is one of the four ways to our well43eing and our health, to our financial success. Everything in the tribe is about establishing the hierarchy, which has to be established rigidly in the corporate culture; otherwise, the culture will fail. Even in the most liberal corporate institutions, the hierarchy remains, no matter whether everybody is dressing in jeans and calls each other by the first name or not. All organizations are rooted in hierarchy and the 44th gate is there, not only to recognize who can fulfill the transformation, but who will honor (this is the tribe) the hierarchy and be loyal.\n\nThe other side is Venus in detriment. An attractive nature that will interact with inferior forces and will fail to apply restrictions, resulting in a risk to continued harmony. There is no success on the material plane unless the hierarchy is properly established and the moment that there is a failure to apply restrictions is the moment that not the end result but the harmony is damaged. It becomes so obvious that if you raise a child without any restrictions, somehow that is not going to be good. The first thing you discover is that restrictions are natural. It is about what kind of restrictions, not about whether they should be there or not. The hierarchy requires its pattern, after all.\n\nHere in the white book: An alertness to patterns that can lead to mastery of the collective. First of all, that is based on memory. If you do not really know what the transformation is about, for example, if you do not know, as a personnel manager, what your product is and of what value it is to be community, you will not be able to choose the right person to present that in terms of their ego.\n\nThe failure of the instinct out of the need for harmony. \"I do not want to tell you that I am the boss because I want you to be my friend.\" This is the other side of it. The first thing to recognize about the nature of the first line, about the nature of conditions, is that this is the root of our material success. It requires that we establish conditions. If we do not establish conditions, we will not have our proper health and we will not have our success on the material plane. Being an anarchist, it is very funny for me to say those things.\n\nWhen you are working at any commercial level, there are two kinds of managers: people managers and goal oriented managers. The first line is about the people manager. This is really the foundation. Remember that when you are starting with the lower trigram, it is involved with its own process and is not really ready to go across to the other side of the channel. The special-ness of the first line is that it is already conscious of the need (it is an awareness gate after all) of how important it is to work with the right people, and find the right people."

      "line": 2,
      "hd_title": "Management",
      "full_text": "When you get to the second line, you get to a line of projection. All second lines are projection outwards, with the inability to be introspective. They cannot look inwards, which means that they are not looking for the people. They are looking towards: Can we get to the goal? Due to that, they can often make mistakes with the people because they are more interested in the goal.\n\nWhen you look at the second line, it is called Management. This is interesting because the nature of most commercial enterprises is that they are goal oriented rather than being people oriented. If I was running a large corporation and I was looking at my personnel staff, I would make sure that both first lines and second lines were there. In other words, it is one thing to be goal orientated but the other thing is that you need to have the right people in that process.\n\nJupiter exalted. The development and management of a proper collective structure which restricts inferior elements by creating cooperative modes that integrate these forces with progressive and superior forces. If you have lousy people who are working for you, it is okay. Integrate them with people who do better and maybe they will be all right. This is what gets done all the time. This is a very common practice. \"They are not doing very well. We will put them with Harry.\"\n\nOn the other side of this is Mars in detriment. A tendency in management to concentrate exclusively on goals, ignoring inferior elements, which leads inevitably to quantitative success and qualitative failure. The second line is good at getting the goals done. They will find an ego that will get the work done but that will lead to a lot of problems in the human organization. Every time that we are looking at the 44/26, we are looking at the most important health movement that we have. So, if it will be a qualitative failure, it is ultimately not going to be good, neither for the corporation nor for the workers or for the consumers (or whoever it is that is involved in the product) because it is not essentially healthy. On the other hand, like all of these things, if you have somebody who is only interested in goals and that is their design, and they have the second line and are working in a company that is only interested in goals, good for them. After all, you are here to be what you are.\n\nThis is not a moral question. This is simply about recognizing that in these first two lines, because they are the instinctive themes, here lies the core of the way in which we work together. It is the core and the way in which we are brought together by those who can be responsible for that. It is two-sided. One side overemphasizes the human element, and the other overemphasizes the goal element. This is the beginning of the hexagram process."

      "hd_title": "Interference",
      "full_text": "This is the line of adaptation and the end of the lower trigram process. In this line, we have the two earlier processes integrated together. Here, we have the line of Interference. The failure to interact based on circumstances. This is a keen sense of what the ego is on the other side because this is the first line that recognizes that there is an ego on the other side and has a sensory connection to it.\n\nMars exalted. The ability to recognize the threat of interference and to prepare for its effects. Neptune in detriment. A deluded response to interference that gets stuck in projection and, as a result, is unrealistic in appraisal and errorprone. Remember that third lines can be very irresponsible. Third lines, by their very nature, know that there is an ego at the other side. In this particular case, they do not really know what it is and how it works. They have to connect to it and learn that.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The alertness and instincts to handle the ego of others. That capability does not mean that they will interact with the ego. The 44.3's have a lot of trouble getting through this whole channel. They make the contact with the ego and on this side can recognize it, but the moment that the splenic system actually meets the ego, there is fear in the splenic system. It is the fear of the past. This fear brings to the 44th gate this sense of, \"Oh, this ego is very powerful and I can get carried away on its energy.\" After all, the 44th hexagram is about dominating, being able to manage the ego power at the other end. The ego is not aware, but it is a motor and the 44 would like to have contact to that motor because it is healthy and turns on the system. At the same time, when the 44 makes contact, it is cautious because it senses the power of the ego.\n\nIt is like when you get on a horse for the first time and suddenly you recognize, \"I am high above the ground and this is a big animal and I do not know what it thinks and it will do weird things.\" So, when you make contact with the horse, you say, \"I'll get off now.\" This is what happens to the 44. It hooks into the ego and says, \"Wait a minute. I'll get off.\" This is the reverse of what Coming to Meet is. They come to meet, but they go away very quickly.\n\nOn the other side of the line: The possibility that the instinct cannot handle the ego of others. This is where it really steps back. It steps into the ego field, catches it all and says, \"I really do not want to deal with that because that is too much for me.\" (Irresponsible in coming to meet.) A manager with this line makes bonds and breaks them. He hires a strong ego who does a wonderful job, but he fires him because the 44 can't stand the person's ego. It does not matter how good they have done the job. Or, that very manager meets somebody who he knows would do a terrific job but he refuses to work with that one, so he does not hire them at all."

      "hd_title": "Honesty",
      "full_text": "The fourth line is the beginning of the upper trigram and its direct resonance is to the first line. Due to that resonance, you know that being a people manager is a deep theme that already matured by the time that you get to the fourth line. The fourth line is an externalization line and, therefore, has a single track. It is deeply fixed on one aspect. Here, this aspect is called Honesty. It says: The refusal to engage in hypocritical interaction. These are people whose management style is considered to be straight forward. They are very direct.\n\nPluto exalted. Indifference at its most logical and cutting. The indifference is to the needs of the individual. After all, this is taking the people-manager resonance from the first line. There is this deep indifference to all this stuff about having to work really hard to make sure that the other is really comfortable with all this.\n\nBy the time you get to the fourth line, you know that there is something on the other side and the only way the fourth line is able to work with them is that it is very direct with them.\n\nThe Sun in detriment, that in extreme situations, in cases of self-sustainment, will expect assistance from forces it has totally rejected. Here the honesty is the genuine need. You want to do business with somebody and, being a fourth line, you are very direct and say, \"Look, I am not in the ABC business, I am in the XYZ business, go away.\" Two years later, you discover that you want to get into the ABC business and you call up the very people you rejected and you can actually say to them, \"Why don't you come over and we'll talk. Now, I am interested in the ABC business.\" This is all about being direct. This directness can seem obsessive because there is nothing else there. They can only be focused in that honesty, in that one transformation that they want to bring about.\n\nThe indifference possible when guided by the instinctive memory. In other words, you really know the type, so why mess around? Put it straight to them.\n\nOn the other side: The sacrifice of indifference for survival. In other words, when a change can come (this is all about transformation) then they can go back to the very thing that they rejected, being very honest and being seen that way."

      "hd_title": "Manipulation",
      "full_text": "The fifth line is the finish of the hexagram process. Here you have the completion of what the hexagram is all about. Within the hexagram, you have the ability to universalize the process. Please understand in this sense that the 44/26 represents the immune system of the tribe. It is the defense system for the tribe. It is what keeps the tribe healthy. This material reality, this fifth line, represents literally what that is all about: what is going to keep the tribe immune from disease, immune from failure at the material level. The 32nd gate was the fear of failure and the 44th gate is the fear of the past and they are trying to overcome those fears through having material success in the present.\n\nThe fifth line is called Manipulation. The ability to transform interaction with inferior elements into the energizing of progressive processes with the additional benefit that, in tapping the inferior elements, they remain weak. Think about the nature of that. That is, you cannot have everybody climb the ladder of the hierarchy. This does not work and yet, at the same time, inferior elements being part of the tribe need to have their sustenance, need to be protected and need to have a sense of self-worth within the community.\n\nThe gift of this sort of manipulation is to integrate these forces into the operation and allow them to have their place by making them comfortable through the manipulating style of the personnel manager and, at the same time, have them be satisfied that they will spend 55 years plugging bolds into the side of a car. This is absolutely essential on this planet. Otherwise things fall apart.\n\nOn the other side of this, Mars in detriment. The tendency in this form of manipulation to become abusive and degenerate to their level. This is the dictatorial fiat. This is the need for control in the 32nd gate. Here, in the detriment of the fifth line of the 44, it becomes the power trip. \"I have the power and you don't. You do what you are told.\" I can be very abusive.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: Where the instinctive recognitions of the patterns leads to the possible manipulation of others. Again, manipulation without any negative connotation. Without a proper hierarchy, there is no success. I have grown up in North America which was rooted in the idea that the traditional hierarchical caste systems could be replaced, so that they would throw away the ideas of monarchy and institute republics. If you go to North America today, they simply replaced that with the monetary class system: how much money you make. The moment they meet you, they want to know how much money you make because then they can put you into a place within the hierarchy.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that, if you are working for a company and you are getting well paid relative to what you do, you don't mind that the CEO is taking home two million dollars. It astonishes me how many employees find it quite normal that the boss is making this enormous fortune while they are slaving for forty-eight hours a week. However, this is natural to us. This is our way. We are animals. Animals are all hierarchical, no matter how sophisticated we look as a patina on the surface. Everything is about hierarchy, and it will not go away. The thing is not to see that as a moral, or prejudice. You have to see that everybody has a place that way. As long as everybody is in the place that is correct for them, no hard feelings and everything will be fine."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Aloofness",
      "full_text": "When we come to the sixth line, we come to the roof of the house, and there we have nothing but the deep desire for transition. Here it is called Aloofness. If you have a hexagram that is called Coming to Meet and you get to the sixth line and it is called Aloofness, you know that this whole process of looking for the ego is past. It is not about looking for the ego. It has to be there, of course, because it is part of the way that you get out: you get to the throat and to manifestation. The sixth line is always looking for something much grander, in that sense. Be aware of something: all sixth lines have within them a potential to be deeply depressed. This ability to stand on the top of the house, to be finished with the process and to be able to look out beyond and wonder what is there and long for it because it is the resonance to the One Night Stand: it may come or it may not. You may get that opportunity or you may not. Because of that, there is this sense of, in the aloofness, \"Nobody is really going to fulfill that for me. I will not get that quality of ego that will lead far beyond all of this material plane that the personnel manager is locked into.\"\n\nPluto exalted. A perfected renewal in which the establishment of a new form inures one to the condemnation of the rejected. This is somebody who has their growing up and they end up finding themselves moving, for example, towards a career where they could have this kind of work. They would never stay there. They could never live out the personnel manager as a personnel manager. There is always something else that is further beyond for them. What is further beyond is the new form: something that is going to change the way that whole hierarchical structure operates.\n\nThe awareness of patterns, which ensures one's instinctive well-being. They do not need the ego on the other side. They are not lusting after it because they can be well within themselves.\n\nOn the other side: The awareness of patterns that can bolster the ego at the expense of the well-being of others. This has nothing to do with being concerned about just any other ego on the other side. It is about something else.\n\nUntil they find that 'something else', they can never commit themselves to the power that is there. Their ability is to recognize a very special quality of ego that will be, in the mystical sense, a real surrender and that what gets transmitted is something totally new. All sixth lines can infuse the collective with something that they are not yet aware of. All sixth lines, because they are collective themes, can go deep into the collective. This is where the collective gets constantly enriched from the individual, from the tribe, so that the collective slowly becomes this umbrella that we all can live within. A very important role here in the 44th gate."

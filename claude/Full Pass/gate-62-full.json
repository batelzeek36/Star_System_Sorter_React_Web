      "hd_title": "Routine",
      "full_text": "All first lines act as a foundation for a hexagram. This first line is called Routine. That is the nature of being organized and the nature of being able to come up with the facts is rooted in a ritual of life in which that process is a routine that goes on all the time. It never stops. The Human Design System has a mystical source but it is a logical system. As long as it exists in the world, there will be people that will test it. Rightfully so. Everything that is logical is endlessly tested. This is the nature and the beauty of logic. For every test, we confirm or not the validity of a pattern and then we can project into the future.\n\nThis line of Routine has Neptune exalted. This is a funny planet to have as a foundation of coming up with facts. The ability to transcend the boredom of routine through a rich and daring fantasy life. When I deal with people that have the 62nd gate (I have my design Earth in this line), I tell them that one of the things that I recognize most about the nature of the logical mind is that you need to project into the future within your mind because you rarely are going to have a chance to actually do the real experiment. It is very difficult to get energy to ideas or opinions because they are simply there to be shared at a communicative level.\n\nSo often, the detail of the 62nd gate is built on fantasy. It is built in the imagination. \"If this works what happens then? And after that?\" This is the inner logical process of trying to see how the pattern will work. But it is a fantasy. It does not have to be reality. It is a way of exploring the logic. By the way, when I say fantasy, I am just talking about a mental process. We are talking about a process in which you look inwards at the mechanics of what that logical pattern is, and you are trying to see all its possibilities before you present it because otherwise, you get all kinds of people saying, \"Is that true?\" and then you have to back it up with facts. Where do your facts come from? You can not necessarily back it up unless you have gone through this inner process of looking at the possibilities.\n\nI was trained as a scientist and the first thing you know as a scientist is that the moment that you establish any theoretical principle, you'd better be your biggest enemy. Before you tell anybody about that principle and that theory, you'd better make sure that you have looked at all the possibilities of why it could be wrong. Look at the possibilities before you open up your mouth and say, \"Hey, look. E = mc2\" and everybody looks at you and says, \"Oh, then prove it.\"\n\nYou have to have this process of looking inwards. Remember that this is a foundation. It has to look inwards. It does not know anything about the opinion. It just wants to see, \"How is this pattern going to work before I can present the facts?\"\n\nIn the white book: The ability to organize the detail through fantasy. Or rebellion against doing the very same thing. In other words, \"I have got it. I have the facts now. I will give it them to you. Here they are.\" But if you do not have this background inside? You see, the logical process has the greatest difficulty of all the processes in finding a motor. If you go down the channel of Talent, a part of the logical process, from the 62, you go to the 48 out of the splenic system, which is not a motor. It is not so easy to turn a logic theory into an experiment. It is very difficult to do that.\n\nSo, underneath this first line are two realities. First, it is like when I was given the Human Design System from the voice, I spent two years by myself before I brought this to anybody. I checked my own chart, watched the Moon. I did not know about any of these things, so I had to go through a learning process before I could do anything about that. I had to explore in detail and caution before I told anybody, \"Hey, I have got this stuff from the voice.\" I had to make sure that the details were there, before I got it out. I knew that I was going to meet all that resistance on the outside. So, one thing to recognize about that whole process of the logical mind and its outlet is that one has to be very careful. The details have to be there before one decides, \"Now, I want it to be experimented with.\"\n\nThe other reality is: Rebellion and its enormous waste of energy. I know so many examples of the 62 standing there. \"Listen. Could you please give me the money so that I can try this out?\" They come up with a logical concept and they spent all of their energy trying to convince people that this is worthy of experimentation, rather than using their energy to make sure that they are right and correct. The logical process attracts all the judgments of the world. Logic always will. Logic is universal and it is the only thing that is going to protect us in the future. Anytime that we make a logical statement, it is natural for other human beings to say, \"Is this true? Prove it to me so that I can see for myself that this is true. Otherwise, I will not accept it.\" The detriment side is somebody who spends all their energy trying to get somebody to finance, to give energy to their theory, rather than knowing clearly what the theory is. These are the two sides of the foundation of the 62nd gate."

      "hd_title": "Restraint",
      "full_text": "When you get to the second line, these people are often caught in a trap. All second lines carry within them the potential of being paper tigers, that is: they project out something they are or are not necessarily. It is not their fault. Second lines do not have this ability to look inwards. The first line knows that it can do detail work. That is why it gets bored. It has the capacity to do detail work and it really has to get into the detail. The second line just projects that out. It is like the child that sits at home and studies. It is focused on doing the detail, but that is a projection. They are projecting out that they are doing the detail. It looks like they are doing the detail. It does not mean that they really are. This is just a field of energy that they are projecting out. Of course, that paper tiger can collapse because the teacher can come up to them and say, \"All right. Let's see the detail.\" And they answer, \"Well. I have not finished yet. I did not get there.\" This is a projected field, and it is not necessarily the truth. The child is not necessarily working on that detail.\n\nThis line is called Restraint. The innate restrictiveness and discipline to comply with and exalt restraint. In other words, they really stay with the detail but all too often it just looks like that.\n\nIn the white book: The discipline necessary for detail work. But not all the time as a guarantee that the detail work is being done. It is there as a projected field, but it does not really mean that it is working.\n\nOn the other side of this, Mercury in detriment. The intellect stymied by severe restraints tends to anxiety and restlessness. Think about what this is like for these people. They are projecting outwards that they can do the detail work, but they do not know why. They are not the first line. The first line knows that detail is essential. The second line just knows, \"I am projecting out the detail.\" But they do not know what is essential in that detail.\n\nIt is like the 62.2 child that is staring at the book, and they do not know what to stare at. They are just looking there. It looks like they are deeply focused and concentrated and taking it all in. Then you say to them, \"What are you reading?\" and they look at you like you are mad. They can't answer the question because they do not know what they are concentrating on. They become restless and anxious.\n\nThis is the dilemma of the 62. You do not get a chance very often to live out the experiment. It is so rare. When I did the Caring Course last year in Hamburg, I talked about the nature of how this works. You just end up with committees that have committees that study a process and maybe one day the process will be actualized. Then you have the review committee that reviews the committee of the committee and they all go through this logical process, and we build this fantastic bureaucracy to get nothing done. It is very difficult for logic to get access to energy and built into that, because it is difficult, underneath is all this restlessness. \"Now that I have got it, I want to try it.\"\n\nBoth the abstract and the logic process are about communicating successfully, and not about doing successfully. Only when somebody can properly communicate their story or their theoretical premise or opinion, only then do they have an opportunity that others may come. That is what it is all about. These are, after all, collective gates.\n\nIn collective circuitry we have no social channels. There is one individual social channel and two tribal ones. The collective is by its very nature social. Every collective aspect inside of you wants and needs to share. The reality here for the second line is to understand that they are projecting out that they are doing the detail but they have that crushed. There is always going to be the paper tiger syndrome where it falls apart and, underneath that, there is all this restlessness that says, \"Yes, but I just wanted to try, and I cannot spend all my time dreaming about this. I want to try it.\" These people get very restless.\n\nAlways remember that that is not a negative. I keep on reminding you of that all the time. Mechanics has no morality. There is nothing to say that this is bad. They are not all paper tigers. Some of them are wonderful and the ones that get deeply restless can be such pains in the neck that you actually give them the money to do the experiment, just to get rid of them. There are advantages in everything. Human beings have this tendency to see everything on the black scale. Everybody looks at their own chart and always looks to what they assume to be the worst aspects. The worst aspects are always the best, but you do not recognize them."

      "hd_title": "Discovery",
      "full_text": "I love this third line because it is one of the best examples for the nature of third lines. Remember something about Human Design and the beauty of its symmetries. Not only do we look at the gate that is before, we look at the gate that comes after in terms of the wheel and there is always one exactly opposite which is the mirror image. The mirror image of the 62 is the 61. The opposition of detail is Inner Truth. The only way for inner truth to come out, ultimately, is that it has to come out factually. Otherwise, it is not truly the truth.\n\nIf you look at the hexagram of Inner Truth, you will see that in the middle of that hexagram are two yin lines sandwiched between two sets of yang lines, and the yin is the material and the fact. It is essence or the framework of things. When you are dealing with the 62nd hexagram, there are so many things involved in that hexagram to be able to try to find the way, out of the inspiration of inner truth, to give us a factual and logical way that we can understand these things. The more that humanity understands that in unison, the easier it is for us to live together in the world. That is what understanding is all about.\n\nThis third line is called Discovery. Everyone I have ever met that has this line hates it. They never really understand it and they don't like it because all third lines are about trial and error. They are about making mistakes. This is the great line of mistake-making. Due to that fact, it is also the great line of discovery. This is Pasteur making a mistake and finding something. This is the story of hundreds and thousands of inventors, scientists, researchers or explorers who go in the wrong direction by mistake and find something totally new. This is the essence of this line.\n\nIt says Uranus exalted, and for a third time in these collective gates we have the word 'genius' and we have Uranus exalting it. A genius for the unusual. The ability to discover valuable information in detail work and to find innovative applications for this knowledge. This 'unusual' ability is the ability to make mistakes, and out of the mistakes, you learn.\n\nRemember what I have said about the nature of wisdom. In the hexagram structure, we have these resonances. This third line is in resonance to the sixth line. There is no way to that wisdom and there is no way to logical truth without mistakes being part of the way. Over the last weeks, I have been watching all kinds of scientific theories that have been postulated and then you immediately see the scientific community coming back from other areas saying, \"Wait a minute. I do not see how this works. They made a mistake.\"\n\nIt is all about that. Was there a mistake? Does the mistake lead to something? Does it lead to discovery? This is the essence of what this line is all about. Whenever you see a third line in your chart, honor that. Mistakes will not punish us now. This is an era in which mistakes can be deeply rewarding because they can lead to all kinds of discovery.\n\nThis is the nature of this line: to recognize that it is okay to make mistakes because you are only communicating, you are not doing. Communicating mistakes is perfect. You have a theory which you share; you have your opinion and you start talking about it. The other person says, \"Wait a minute. This and that is missing. This does not work, you made a mistake.\" And then you have a chance to go through that whole process again, and you have a chance to see whether you should stay with it, whether you need to fix it or whether it is time to drop it and move on to the next thing.\n\nIt is a process about accepting that learning is like that. I know what this is like. I have a 43.3/23.3/4.3 mind which is all unconscious. It is impossible for me in my life process not to have made thousands of intellectual mistakes. That is how I learned. It is a learning process, to go through things and learn from them. It is so important for people who have this not to get stuck in thinking that because they made a mistake, they are not of value. We turn the word mistake into one of the dirtiest words around. We associate mistake with failure, with a problem. None of these things are so. It is a legitimate process for growth."

      "hd_title": "Asceticism",
      "full_text": "When you get to the upper trigram, you get to the fourth line, to the line of externalization, of being fixed. You also get to the beginning of the transpersonal process, so the 62.4 is well aware of the fact that there is an opinion that is coming at it from the 17th hexagram, that there is an organized concept that it has to deal with and that it has to bring detail to. It is not like the first three lines. It is not simply caught up in its own process of providing detail, but there is a recognition that the detail has to do with opinion. It has to do with something that is coming from the outside. The first line always represents the foundation. When you are dealing with detail, the first line is very important because it will establish the groundwork, the framework upon which any formula can be built. When you get to the fourth line, you get to the ability to project out into the world, in the sense of externalizing that basic formula. But because there is a limitation in this, because the fourth line is transpersonal, it recognizes the difficulty inherently, genetically. It recognizes the difficulty of how long it takes to get the detail right.\n\nThis line is called Asceticism. The perfected ascetic withdrawal in the pursuit of harmony and simplicity, where outside dangers do not exist and there is time to pursue inner meaning in detail. \"Don't bother me, I am thinking.\" This is the fourth line. \"Don't ask me to present a paper for your journal because I have not finished my research.\" These are people that are always busy doing their research. \"Leave me alone, I have not come up with the answer yet and I will not talk to you until I have the detail.\" \"If you start bothering me while I am in the middle of this process, you are really going to disturb me and you will ruin my harmony if you will not let me finish this.\"\n\nYou see that there is an immediate understanding that it really takes time to get the detail right because the moment that you do not get the detail right, what you get is a lot of complaints. Opposite the 17th gate that feeds the opinions to the 62 is the 18th gate, the great gate of complaining and correction, of challenging authority. \"I will not trust you unless you give me the facts,\" and the fourth line knows that the best way for them is to avoid all of that until they really got it. By the way, they can die before they really get it. That is another story.\n\nDetail that can only be expressed after periods of isolation and reflection. Anybody that has the 62.4, I always tell them the same thing. \"Wait and see. Do you homework and your research, get into your stuff and work at it.\" Fourth lines are always saying, \"Where is the opportunity?\" You can wait for the opportunity. In the moment when the opportunity is there, then you can externalize. These are people that need to be left alone in their process. If you have a child that has the 62.4 and it is studying for an exam, don't ask it questions in the middle of its studying. \"What are you working on, dear?\" Don't ask them anything. Leave them alone and let them go through their process to the end, so that they can be comfortable to come out and say, \"Yes. Now, I have the detail.\"\n\nOn the other side of this, Pluto in detriment. The urge to take action against established values that when restrained by circumstances leads to withdrawal that waits for opportunity. In terms of the white book: Where the detail is organized, isolation as a strategy waiting for the right opportunity for expression. Very Plutonic: \"I'll wait until they come to me and then I will take them by surprise. They do not know that I have really got it and the moment they come to me, I will go, 'Ha'.\" It is a strategy. It is so important for these people to wait. Wherever you see a fourth line, you know that it is saying to you, \"Stay with your process. Wait for your opportunity to come and then you have the advantage of being able to project that out.\" Asceticism is very important in that process. In resonance to the 18.4, this line feels incompetent because the detail is not complete."

      "hd_title": "Metamorphosis",
      "full_text": "This is the great line of Metamorphosis. This is the great line that comes up with wonderful theories and understandings. It is always projected on these people that they are the people that have the detail. That is okay if you are 40 years old and you have collected some data, but when you are five or six years old and everybody is projecting on you that you are the one that has the detail, that is not so easy.\n\nThe fifth line says: When excellence is achieved, action is necessary. When detail has been achieved, when all the detail has been done. These are the people that attract the energy. The fifth line is the line of universalization and all fifth lines operate in the emotional wave of seduction. All fifth lines are seducers or the seduced. All fifth lines, because they are seduced by the projection of the outside, can in turn be their seducer if they can produce. Everybody comes at this fifth line and says, \"We know that you have the detail. You tell us.\" May be they have it.\n\nMoon exalted. The reaching out to others to share, symbolized by the Moon's phases as it moves from darkness to eventually fully sharing its light. This is the basic formula. Everything having to do with the logical process and everything having to do with what we call talent, all of these things take a long time to mature. Most of us do not reach any real state of understanding about the nature of our being until we are somewhere between 40 and 50, if we are lucky. The vast majority of human beings never really get to that point.\n\nThe whole process about this ability, of having all of this projected onto this fifth line (\"We know that you have the detail\"), they have to have the inner discipline, they have to have the Restraint that is in the second line (the resonance below) until they really do have the detail. They know that everybody is projecting on them. This is the kind of child that goes into the classroom and knows that the teacher is going to ask them. They know it, and they do not want to be asked. They may not be ready. Because they know that the teacher will always project on them that they have the detail, if they don't do their homework, if they don't study, they get caught out and feel very embarrassed because they know that they are being projected on.\n\nTo be projected on is always an opportunity to fulfill that projection and more, but it also means that there is always this threat of humiliation, that you are caught, in that sense, because it has been projected on you and you are not delivering.\n\nIn the white book: The understanding that only when the details are complete can action or expression be initiated. Fifth lines need to understand that it is okay for them not to commit themselves to the projections of others until they are ready. When they learn to wait, they have the power. Then, it works for them. If they do not learn to wait, if they get seduced by everybody else's projection, they end up in situations where they become less and less comfortable with what detail can be for them, and then you come to the other side of this.\n\nNeptune in detriment. A tendency in metamorphosis to seek acclaim through dramatic presentation. In the white book: When the details are organized, the need for attention demands expression. Because these people can be projected on, they can really do their best to try to seduce you with their facts, and they will. They will do their very best. They can to get you to understand. This is one of their favorite things. \"Do you understand what I mean?\" You can hear that in all languages. They keep on emphasizing this. \"You are projecting on me that I understand, but do you understand?\" This is this process that goes on. Because they can be very frustrated in that, they will often stand up and say, \"I've got it. Eureka!\" and make their big dramatic presentation, and they often fall very far because that is the whole thing about logic. It is so easy to tear logic to pieces because you need to have the detail. If you do not have the detail, it does not work.\n\nThe whole thing about this is to understand the way the planet looks at this line, the way the planet looks at detail. It looks at the detail and says, \"If you have the detail, why don't you give it to us as a finished product?\" The whole business with the HIV epidemic. You have all kinds of research, people who are trying to find some kind of process in which they can relieve or cure HIV. The moment that some scientist comes up with some genetic marker that he or they think may (if they work on it) become this or that, you have this outcry of people who say, \"Now that you have got that detail, why can't you experiment with it on us?\" Then the scientific community gets under all kinds of pressure because the outside world says, \"Turn the detail into fact, into a living reality,\" often before it is time. This is the great pressure that is on the fifth line.\n\nBecause there is so much pressure put on them from the projection of the outside, they have to be the disciplined ones that say, \"I can't afford to allow that projection to pull me in until I have my details.\" Most of these people have to get a good education. Anybody that has the 62nd gate needs to have a good education and when I say that, it does not have to be a formal education. But these are people that need to do their research in life. They need to look into things. They need to explore. They need to do the process of collecting the detail. It is very important for them. And the nature of words for them will always be very important. How to get people to understand. How to present them with a verbal formula that allows them to see the pattern and the picture.\n\nA good example is this meteorite that they knew came from Mars. You had these guys that were slicing it open and all of a sudden they thought that they saw things that looked like very primitive, early cellular structures. They made this dramatic presentation which was in the front pages of all the newspapers. There was a news conference and everybody was saying, \"Life on Mars.\" These guys are having a tough time now because the whole scientific community jumped on this data, and they told them: \"Look, you have got your experiment wrong. This is not right and it does not work.\" They are sitting there with shame on their face and say: \"All, you know, we think it does, maybe. We don't know.\" Dramatic presentation can get you into trouble. The projection of everybody else on them once they had these details, which they had had for about 10 years, put pressure on them to release that information, and then the whole thing blew up. All before NASA had enough money to send new projects to Mars."

      "hd_title": "Self-discipline",
      "full_text": "So we get to the sixth line, to the end of this process, to the line of transition. The keynote of the sixth line is always whether you trust the process or not. Are the details valuable? Are they really of value for humanity? Is this really something that I have to spend my life on? Is it really worthwhile to put all this energy into detail? This is the question the sixth line will always ask.\n\nIt is called Self-discipline. It has Saturn exalted. A penny saved is a penny earned. Detail as the path to material success. Sixth lines can always be successful out of their detail. Most of them end up just using that capacity to make money, to stay alive and to look after themselves. The real detail, the deep detail that they are capable of; they often never get there, like all sixth lines. There is a part of them that says, \"Well, is it really worth it? I am not looking at the gate or at the channel. I am looking at the whole circuit now.\"\n\nWhen you look at the whole logical circuit out of the sixth line, what you are looking at is the capacity to be able, out of love, to guide humanity in the proper direction into the future. The 62.2 is saying, \"If I can't guide humanity with love into the future, I am not going to worry about the detail. I will just look after myself.\"\n\nIn the detriment of this: The gift for, but not the discipline, to do the necessary detail work to succeed. The skills but not the discipline to succeed. There is a wonderful joke. When you get to the 62.6, the very next hexagram is the 56.1. When you get to the end of the abstract process in the 56.6, you want to be a 31.1 and you want to lead logically. When you get to the end of being 62.6, where you have the gift for detail, you want to go over to the 56.1 and tell the story of how it all worked. The 56.1 is there to tell the story about the achievements from the past, to reflect on the past and tell the story of how it worked.\n\nThe 62.6's do not care about anything. What they really want to be able to see is, \"Tell me what the world will look like after my detail becomes the guide for humanity.\" That is what they want. They want to know how it will actually work. They want to project into the future so that they can go back and reflect into that imaginary past and say, \"Aha.\"\n\nThe first line of the 56 is called Quality. Is it really the detail that is of value? For the 62.6, it is very difficult. The only time that you ever capture the sixth line is when they have the impression, \"That is the thing for me.\" Then they will give their gift to the collective. If they do not find their thing, they don't care about their gift, they do not get involved in the collective, they stay for themselves and say, \"I just know my detail, and I'll be able to tell my banker that he made a mistake. There are nine pennies missing on my account.\""

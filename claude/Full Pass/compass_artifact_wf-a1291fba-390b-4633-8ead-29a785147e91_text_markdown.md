# The 64 Gates of Human Design: Ra Uru Hu's Complete Naming System

**Ra Uru Hu created distinct names for all 64 gates in Human Design that differ from traditional I Ching hexagram names, emphasizing energetic qualities and behavioral patterns rather than symbolic imagery.** The definitive source is The Complete Rave I'Ching (2001), published by Jovian Archive Corporation and adopted as the standard text by the International Human Design School (IHDS). While each gate corresponds numerically to its I Ching hexagram counterpart, Ra Uru Hu's naming system reframes these ancient concepts through the lens of Human Design's unique synthesis of astrology, chakras, Kabbalah, and quantum physics.

## Understanding the naming distinction

The fundamental difference between I Ching and Human Design nomenclature reflects their divergent purposes. Traditional I Ching hexagram names like "The Wanderer" or "The Arousing" employ poetic symbolism rooted in ancient Chinese cosmology. Ra Uru Hu's Human Design names like "Stimulation" or "Shock" instead highlight the specific energetic function and behavioral expression of each gate within the bodygraph. Some gates retain similar names (Gate 1: both systems use "The Creative"), while others diverge significantly (Gate 10: I Ching's "Treading" becomes "Behavior of the Self" or "Love of Self" in Human Design). This reinterpretation allows practitioners to understand gates as energetic centers of human consciousness rather than divination symbols.

## Source verification and authenticity

**The Complete Rave I'Ching by Ra Uru Hu remains the definitive reference** for Human Design gate nomenclature. Published in 2001 by Jovian Archive Corporation, this comprehensive text serves as the official standard for the International Human Design School (IHDS). Cross-referencing with The Definitive Book of Human Design (co-authored by Ra Uru Hu and Lynda Bunnell), Jovian Archive's official website, and established Human Design schools confirms complete consistency in gate naming across authoritative sources.

Minor variations exist where Ra Uru Hu himself used multiple descriptors for certain gates, reflecting different aspects of their energy rather than contradictions. Gates like 2, 10, 21, 26, 41, and 56 commonly appear with alternative names across official materials. These variations represent complementary perspectives on the same core energetic quality—for instance, Gate 26 appears as both "The Egoist" and "The Trickster," emphasizing different facets of its ego-driven, strategic nature.

## Conclusion: A reframed cosmology

Ra Uru Hu's renaming of the 64 hexagrams transformed ancient divination symbols into a modern map of human consciousness and energetic mechanics. His system prioritizes functional understanding over symbolic poetry, making gate energies accessible for practical application in understanding individual design. The Human Design gate names emphasize psychological patterns, behavioral tendencies, and energetic qualities that manifest in daily life, while maintaining reverence for their I Ching origins through consistent numerical correspondence and secondary references to traditional hexagram names. This synthesis creates a bridge between ancient wisdom and contemporary self-knowledge, offering practitioners a precise language for discussing human energetic architecture.

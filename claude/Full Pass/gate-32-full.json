In other words, yes, change is inevitable but I will make sure that I have all the details before I get involved with that change and leave behind tradition.\n\nMars in detriment. An uncontrollable urge to bypass essentials which inevitably leads to the disruption of continuity."

Tlhe 5d\"s flirt to be familiar: you go up to the boss while he is having his dinner and say, \"Good evening, Mr. So and so,\" and they book at you and say, \"Do I know you?\" \"Yes, I work in the department.\"\n\nThe other side of this jupiter in detriment. A tendency in frustration, ;particularly from a position of strength, to social withdrawal rather than persistent control. The projection here is that II have to control everything, 'phase people are control freaks. Tlhis leads directly to the 21.\n\nThis is very tribal business. \"I have -to control the resources to make sure that there is no failure. I am either going to control it harmoniously or in a way that people are very uncomfortable -with ime. I say, you are Hired.\" That is what the :32 can always say. I can look -at the Marrying Maiden and say, *Yes, very nice.\" The same one that comes up to the 'boss and says, \"Good morning, Mr. So-and-so,\" if the boss looks at you and says, \"Who are you?\" then you Will not make your way up the ladder.\n\nRestraint is what the note is here."

      "hd_title": "Lack of continuity",
      "full_text": "This is simply stepping out there for the first time, trying to go across that channel and trying to make contact with the 54 on the other side, and the recognition that the 54 is really there. What the 54 is will condition the nature of what the 32 is, this recognition of adaptation that has to take place within the channel. It is called Lack of continuity. This is exactly opposite to the nature of this hexagram which is about continuity. One can be very irresponsible in terms of the nature of how one is conservative.\n\nMercury exalted. Indecision and persistent reevaluation, that only because of its basic intelligence manages to endure. The thing to recognize here is that this position of the 32nd gate is inherently intelligent. If you look at signs of intelligence in somebody's chart there are many, by the way-the 32nd hexagram is one of them. It is a sign of intelligence.\n\nThe Jupiterian side is: An over-reliance on traditionally legitimized standards that in times of change can be totally out of step and suffer unexpected humiliation. This is the whole thing about third lines anyway. You make a bond and then the bond gets broken and there is going to be all kinds of stuff that gets left as the debris of that. This is all about the fear of failure.\n\nIndecision in times of transformation. \"What do I do and who do I do it with? Do I do it with you? If I do it with you, I cannot do it my way. I have to do it our way.\"\n\nThe other side of this: A lack of instinct in times of transformation. Not being able to get it at the right time. Not being able to adapt at the right time. The three is the kind of person that says to you, \"Yes, maybe that will work. I'll think about it..\" Then they meet you again and they tell you,. \"Yes, I really think that I will do it. Let's set up a contract.\" They do not really know. It is indecisionL Everything gets prollonged. They are not really certain what to do with all of that. The whole thing them can fall apart. All of a sudden, you call them up for the day of the signing and they are not there anymore )because they have broken that bond entirely, and it's gone."

      "full_text": "Whenever you come to the fourth line, remember the resonance between first and fourth linen You are coming to the upper trigram and you come to aichange in the nature of the frequency. The fourth line is about externalization, the ometrack., You take one. aspect and run along with it: We also know that fourth lines are ihheremily corrupt or being corrupted.\n\nHere we have Right is; might.. Think about that because that is the one-crack. Everything is about the power. If you have the power, you are right. Even in times of change, certain underlying principles endure. Whoever controls, the! purse, controls, the purse. Where Jupiter will establish right action in, the larger social realm, Saturn will lead to inner strength and endurance as long as: it is not threatened from the ouiside.\n\nThe instinct to maintain one's principles in times of change; or The instinct to maintain one's principles as long as one's security is not threatened. Either you have the power to maintain it, no matter what (Right is might) and you corrupt others with that (\"I have the power and you do what I say whether you think that that is right or not.\"), or the other side is: \"I can only have the power if you do what I tell you to do. I will make sure that I will not have people that are working for me who do not listen to my orders, whether they like them or not.\" This is just a one-track. It is neither good nor bad. It can be very successful when the principles are correct. If the values are not correct, they still have that one -track-mind."

      "hd_title": "Flexibility",
      "full_text": "The fifth line is the fulfillment of the essence of what the hexagram is. It is the capacity to universalize, to be able to bring it out, not only to the gate that is at the other end of the channel, but to begin the process of moving into the circuitry. This is something that has a broader movement. Due to its collective keynote, it is an aspect that can bring the tribe to collective change.\n\nThis is something that we deal with in the tension of the world today. For example, the United Nations, as a collective organization, wants the Bosnians, the Serbs and the Croats, who are tribal, to make peace with each other. If you want to look at the fulfillment of this hexagram, it is about the flexible projection of power. Fifth lines resonate to second lines. It is no longer the pure projection of the second line. What happens is that they are the ones that naturally have the greatest impact in times of change.\n\nOne of the classic examples that you know about is in corporations and what they call downsizing. This is the detriment. This is very common. We are not going to look after all the people in the company anymore who have been loyal to us for 25 years, who have been our family and allowed us to become wealthy. We will fire all of them because our shareholders need profits. We are in times of change because we have a globalizing economy, and I am sorry you have to be the victim. We really wanted to do this five years ago, but now we can do it. \"\n\nIt depends on where you are in that. If you are victim, this is a terrible thing. It appears to be deeply violent in that sense. If you are not the victim, it can just mean being flexible. The person who is making that decision says, \"look, if I do not fire these five thousand workers, the Indonesians will steal my market and all my other 25,000 workers will lose their jobs and my shareholders will go mad.\" That is the other side of the story. These things are not one -dimensional. That is the universalizing element.\n\nWhenever you see fifth lines in a chart, whenever you see transits that are affecting fifth lines, you know that there is a special kind of element at work that is trying to get things projected outward in a much larger field. This is a universalizing process."

      "hd_title": "Tranquility",
      "full_text": "Here, we get to the roof of the house and we are not in the house anymore. The nature of the hexagram is going through a transformation. This is one of those lines that I kept running into so often because it can be depressive and because we had Neptune activating the other side of it. Therefore, we have a whole generation of people in the early 1990's that went into all kinds of severe depressions due to the nature of this line.\n\nConsider that the tribe is essentially materialist even when it is being communal at the other side. Communalism is all about coming up with a bargain so that everybody has what they need. Tribal life is, by its very nature, material. This aspect of the tribe, moving up to the instinctive stream, is what is essential. It is the ability to recognize what will work, what change to accommodate, in order that the continuity of the material success of the tribe can survive, so that we need not be afraid of failure.\n\nThe fear of failure is a theme that we all live with. It is a global theme: this deep sense that we cannot fail, that we must have the material that we need. When you get to the sixth line, it is kind of like, \"Well, I am not really interested in just that. There must be something else other than just climbing up the corporate ladder, making our bread and butter, doing our job.\"\n\nThe sixth line is called Tranquility. Change is inevitable. The projection of power in the 32nd hexagram is trying to make sure that transformation can take place, that there won't be a failure."

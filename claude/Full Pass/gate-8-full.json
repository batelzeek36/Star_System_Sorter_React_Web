      "hd_title": "Honesty",
      "full_text": "First lines always speak of the essence of a hexagram and this first line is called Honesty. It says, The truthful acceptance of limitation and the recognition that it can only be transcended through sharing. This is so important: the individual is always limited because nothing in the individual process can actually flower unless it is being accepted either by the collective or the tribe. We have already seen that social pressures are going to be very important in the development of an individual life. This 8th gate is a deep recognition that the individual is there to guide the collective. After all, the 1st gate which is on the other side is one of the four gates of the Sphinx. This is a gate of direction and it is part of the central column that runs up and it is all about a mutative process.\n\nThe 8th gate expresses the identity of the individual that says, \"I will share with you my knowing for your benefit.\" That is the individual process. \"I want to be able to contribute my knowing, my recognition, my capacity to explain to you what the direction is and I want to share that with you for your benefit so that you won't hurt me because I am different than you are.\"\n\nOn one side you have Neptune exalted. The awareness that the whole is always greater than the sum of its parts. This is a deep recognition, the understanding that nothing, the knowing in that sense, is complete unless it involves the totality. This is the beginning of the process of the individual acting as an agent of change in the world because they recognize that they must penetrate into the collective.\n\nOn the other side of this, the Mercury in detriment. Withdrawal. The fear of losing individuality in a group environment. This is the fundamental fear of all individuality. \"I know that I can make a contribution to the collective but does that mean that then I have to be just like them, when I don't want to? I can contribute by directing them but I don't want to be like them because I can't. I can only be like me. \" This fear is underneath.\n\nIn the white book: Knowing that creative expression must be honestly communicated and shared. Understand that the 8/1 is the channel of the Creative Role Model. This is about being an example and not being a leader (that is logical), not being a witness (that is abstract). It is about being an example. An example does not dictate. An example acts out its example in the hope that that can be a contribution to the totality.\n\nThe other side: The design to share creativity at the expense of individuality. \"Yes, we love your contribution but from now on you have to make your contribution on Mondays, V*dnesdays and Fridays from 10 to 12.\" This is always the threat to the individual. There is a balancing point between maintaining one's individuality and reaching out to the collective. All of my definition is individual and I have gone through this process all of my life. I deal with you as a collective. I have found a medium for that because I happen to be an individual that can explain myself. In being able to explain myself, I can connect to the collective but believe me, I am different than you and I know that and nothing about you will change me. The joke is that I want to make a contribution for you. After all, the individual is doing that to protect itself. That is number one.\n\nThe second thing is if it works, the individual feels very good about that. Connecting to the collective is important. There is no Human Design System without the collective. The individual becomes stronger in that, whether or not it is connected to the ego. If it becomes egotistical about it, that is another story but they do become stronger and they do contribute to protect themselves.\n\nPlease understand: that is by design the only genetic path for mutation. After all, it is for others. In the end, this contribution is there to provide mutation. By the way, that mutation can be good or bad. You can bring disease into the world as an individual and you can kill half the population. You can bring a mental virus into the world that destroys the way people see the world or think. I mean, everything is possible in the nature of what mutation is. It is just about the process but in that sense it is always about offering. That is why the third line says it is a phony. When we get to the third line, we get to that story."

      "hd_title": "Service",
      "full_text": "When you get to the second line, you get to projection. You are dealing here with a gate that says, \"I know that I can make a contribution or not.\" When you get to the second line, they are projecting outwards the fact that they are there to make a contribution. It is the great line of service. Remember the nature of making a contribution: they are making it without really recognizing what is being contributed as a direction. They do not really have the depth. They just project out that they can make a contribution.\n\nService. The highest good, to serve selflessly. The Earth in detriment, where reward is a prerequisite of service. It is a very simple line. In the white book: The potential to be an example through unselfish expression; or The willingness to be an example for a price. One or the other. These are the kind of people that will guide you through the city. You pay them and they'll guide you. They will take you along and they will leave you off when they are finished with you. They can do a very good job, individually, taking the collective on a tour and you pay them and later they'll leave you. Or they will do it selflessly: the lost tourist in the city and somebody comes very nicely and takes them on a tour and shows them where everything is. It can be selfless. It can be for pay but they do not really know what they are contributing. Because of that, they are projecting out that they can make the contribution but maybe they can't.\n\nSecond lines can be paper tigers. They can always be putting out this genetic signal that says, \"I can make a contribution,\" and when they are asked to make the contribution, they may not be able to fulfill it and then they go through the crisis of all individuality: when it cannot fulfill its example then it is shunned. The collective will not pay any attention anymore.\n\nMy favorite description for the 8th hexagram is the taxi driver. This is really what the 8th hexagram is all about. You get into their car and they'll drive you along. They will take you from place to place. This is their nature but they are not there to stay with you. They are there to go through this directive process and make their contribution. So many people that have the 8th gate are disturbed by the fact that they can make a valid contribution for others but those others soon forget. They go on to other things.\n\nThis is about the selflessness of the individual that is necessary. The joy comes from being yourself. The contribution to society allows you to maintain your integrity as an individual because they will leave you alone if you can make a contribution. Everybody thought that I was crazy until I had a book published and then it was risky. Then they said, \"Well, he made his contribution. We can leave him alone now. We don't have to worry about whether we should put him into a strait jacket.\""

      "hd_title": "The Phony",
      "full_text": "We get to the end of the lower trigram. Remember that lower trigrams are only concerned about the nature of the gate itself. This is the line of John Paul U. You can enjoy my analysis of that.\n\nThe acceptance of the style and not the substance of communal actions. Again, all third lines are lines of adaptation. They are the basis of trial and error. They are based on this learning process. What is recognized in that learning process is that the individual cannot survive unless they find a way, a mode, a role, a mask, a style for being able to connect to the collective. What happens to people that have the 8.3 is that they look for the right kind of style. Jean Paul II found his style. He has a tall hat, a stake and they all have their costumes. Through that style, even though he is very individual, something is expressed to the collective. The collective gets access to his guidance, to his example, because he is a master of that style. To be a phony is neither positive nor negative. It is simply the real description of what this is. The style is everything.\n\nThe Moon exalted. The perfected and rarely detected superficial intimacy. This is classic of the individual: the style to create the intimacy and yet, at the same time, a deep protection that says, \"Hey, I am still this individual.\"\n\nThe other side has Saturn in detriment. A shallowness that underestimates others and overestimates its own ability to continue its deception without detection. Style is style. It is not substance. This is the individual playing out a role and, in playing out that role, they make mistakes and grow out of that process.\n\nIn the white book: The example as an expression through style, not substance; or An over-reliance and unfounded confidence in style. These are people that when the collective is not interested in them and their style has not worked, they cannot figure out why. \"Why didn't it work? I mean I look like a guru, I talk like a guru. Why didn't anybody come?\" Style is not always the real thing but it helps individuals to have a mask. The individual pretends to be like the collective."

      "hd_title": "Respect",
      "full_text": "When you get to the upper trigram in this gate of contribution that is designed to connect to the collective, you get to transpersonal gates. So you get to the innate ability within the individual in this line: to be able to reach out to the community or the tribe. This line is called Respect. Remember that fourth lines are all about being fixed and onetracked but they are also deeply opportunistic, waiting for those opportunities.\n\nThe gift of naturally recognizing the contributions of others and particularly, the acknowledgement of those who lead by example. Jupiter exalted. The uncompromising drive to assimilate. Remember something about the 8: it is looking to the other side, to the 1. The 1 is the yang force. This is the creative direction in life. This is the individual creative expression. You can imagine that the 1 is the artist and the 8 is the gallery dealer. That is their relationship.\n\nThe capacity in the 8.4 is to recognize the value of the creative potential on the other side and to see that that creative potential, through their contribution, is something that can affect the totality. It is the art dealer that sees the starving painter and looks at the paintings and thinks, \"Oh, my god. This is wonderful.\" He puts it into his shop and all of a sudden, they become well-known because that contribution has been made.\n\nOn the other side: Mercury in detriment. In a group where limitation is transcended, reason alone cannot predict individual worth. As an example, the acknowledged leader of an athletics team is not necessarily the most talented. The individual who is fixed on making a contribution can be the one that really becomes the leader and the example in that sense. This example of an athletic team: you may have an athlete on that team who is somebody whose very spirit is about making a selfless contribution to the nature of how that team operates. They are the ones that will ultimately get the attention of the team and be a de facto leader by the quality of their example. What is being very fixed here is the fixed communication, the fixed expression of direction that the 8.4 knows it must make.\n\nIn the white book: The drive to contribute and be an example to and for others, and on the other side: A gift for contribution that is not conditioned by limitations. This is a very positive line. These people can be very one -tracked. What happens to them is that they are very positive for everybody else but they suffer a great deal themselves. These are people that are always making a contribution and they don't necessarily feel like they are recognized for the contribution they are making. Remember that there is an intrinsic honesty in the resonance to the first line here in the fourth line. There is an honesty about who can really lead and who can't, who can really be an example and who can't. When they make their contribution, there is a sense that nobody is paying attention to them. The 8th gate can often feel unloved for its contribution and, of course, the sphinx gates are not about love. They are about direction.\n\nThis is one of those things for all 8th gates to deal with: they have a capacity to contribute to others and make that contribution without necessarily being rewarded. That does not mean that they do not get the reward but it does mean that it is much more difficult because they are individual.\n\nI want to make a comment on the end of this line where it says that they are not necessarily the most talented. One of the keys to individuality: individuals are not here to be best. The moment that an individual thinks that they have to be the best, it is over. The best is for the collective. That is a collective thing. That is mastery, experimentation, to get to the point where you are really the best. But the individual is here to be different. They don't have to be the most talented athlete to be the focus of attention and to be the example that guides others. They just have to be themselves.\n\nWhenever I deal with individuals, I always remind them of that: \"Do not punish yourself in thinking that you have to be the best. You never ever have to be the best. You only have to be yourself. If you are yourself, you will be recognized and if you try to be the best, you will not.\" Understand the principle of that. The collective process is about comparing and the individual process is not. So, the moment you are trying to be best, it is all a comparison game and it has nothing to do with being individual."

      "hd_title": "Dharma",
      "full_text": "First lines always tell you the essence of what that hexagram is about and fifth lines are always about how it is seen from the outside. The way that this individual contribution is seen from the outside is as something that is rooted in separation. In other words, the way in which the outside sees the individual through this fifth line is: \"Let us take advantage of their direction but leave them once we get there.\" This is great line of the taxi driver. This line is called Dharma. Holding together does not exclude eventual separation. Successful union, after a proper term, will encourage separation. The fledgling once mature is expected to leave the nest. This is right action that does not harm the integrity of the union.\n\nIt is very important for these people to recognize that other people need their direction but once they have it, it does not mean that they must go away; it means that they must be allowed to go away. In other words, for the person that has the 8.5, they can always make the contribution of direction but who they make that contribution to isn't necessarily going to be consistent.\n\nWe have two ways of looking at that. One way is the exalted side with Jupiter, The teacher. The other is the Sun in detriment. The parent that cannot let go of the child, understanding only that its authority is being challenged. \"I know what is best for you,\" says the parent.\n\nIn the white book: Contribution as part of a process of sharing that accepts and expects limitation, exemplified in teaching. The ultimate goal of the individual teacher is to have students that not only transcend them but leave them. \"Here, you have the knowledge. Go away. I do not want to see you again. Take the knowledge and do your thing.\" This is the essence of that one side. It is okay that you are not going to be there for the rest of this person's life.\n\nOn the other side, in the detriment, is this sense of loss in the capacity to make that contribution: somebody accepts that contribution and all of a sudden they are gone. They have this sense of loss that they cannot continue to live out this role of contributing. Contribution as an end in itself that neither accepts nor expects limitation, exemplified by the parent that cannot let go of the child.\n\nThe ideal is that when you are the 8.5 taxi driver, when you get to where they have to go, you have to let them out. You cannot keep them in the back seat. They have to pay you and go. Otherwise, you have a real problem. This is the nature of the 8.5, this recognition. Remember that it is projected on them that they can make the selfless contribution. \"This one will take me. This one will guide me.\" Every time that individual is being asked for their guidance (and they are always looking for that out of the 8th gate), in that moment, this is a very important energy for them to come into contact with.\n\nIt is difficult when that energy is gone unless one accepts the nature of what this role is: to make that contribution and recognize that it is not about fixing something for life. Again, that is the protection of the individual, not to get caught up in who you contribute to and end up being conditioned by them, away from your true nature. \"You were so good at driving me in a taxi. Now I let you drive my bus.\"\n\nThink about the dilemma of the 8. You have the 8 and you go into a department store and somebody comes up to you and says, \"Can you tell me where the such-and-such department is?\" The 8 is always going to be asked for their service, no matter where they are. They are always going to be mistaken for people that can take you where you have to go. They are under a lot of pressure because of that."

      "hd_title": "Communion",
      "full_text": "When you get to the sixth line, you get to the end of the process and you get to Communion. It says: The certainty which grows out of harmony. Venus exalted. The awareness of patterns that ensures correct timing. This is one of the things that come out of the individual process which is the recognition that, without the correct timing, because individuals are rooted in their moods, contribution may not be successful. We all know this in one way or another, where you offer to make a contribution to somebody, to offer them direction. If you offer it at the wrong time, nothing is going to work, even if you are very clear. If you offer it at the right time, even if you are not clear, they are more open to it. Everything about the contribution of the individual to society is rooted in a sense of timing.\n\nPluto in detriment. Doubt which may engender regret even in the most ideal circumstances. The polarity in the white book: The gift of knowing when to contribute creatively; or Uncertainty in timing and regret despite circumstances. Sixth lines are not about to make a contribution. Like all sixth lines, there is a restrictive process within them. It is a process that says, \"Yes, but will this contribution lead to mutation?\" In other words, if I am a taxi driver, I will only take somebody from A to B if it is going to change the world and if it will not change the world, why should I bother and just be the conduit of that? Is it really of value? Deep in the individual process is this ongoing need to find a way to bring mutation into the world. The sixth line is saying, \"All right, I will make that contribution, but it has to be mutative. It has to be something that really is going to be of value.\"\n\nThe knowing when to contribute is the recognition of patterns. Individuals need to come to grips with that. They have to understand the collective and the tribe because if they don't understand the others, if they do not understand their patterns, it will be much more difficult for them to make a contribution at the right time that can be mutative.\n\nThink about how that works. Several years ago, Martin Grassinger was doing homoeopathic work with one of his patients. They had a problem and he had the right medicine which he gave them but it did not work. This was in the early years, when we first met and I said, \"Well, take a look at the transits and see when that part of the body is connected.\" It had to do with the face. It was somebody who had an open ajna and an open throat center. So, there was a transit coming, a nodal transit to the 43/23 that would connect the open centers, so that this medicine which is designed for the pituitary gland could actually get to these glands. He told the person to come back again and that he had found something that really worked (the same medicine). He gave the patient this medicine during the nodal transit which lasted two months and the problem cleared up.\n\nThe success of individual contribution is determined by timing. If you give the right medicine at the wrong time, it means nothing. What happens is that this individual gets caught up in this process of \"Where is the right cosmic moment?\" It is not just the mundane timing. It is the timing that unleashes this process, unleashes this possibility, so that this contribution can lead to mutation."

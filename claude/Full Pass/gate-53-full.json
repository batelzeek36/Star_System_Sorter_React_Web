      "hd_title": "Accumulation",
      "full_text": "The essence of this hexagram is Accumulation. Every beginning comes after something is completed. What usually happens is that you have two kinds of new beginnings. You have the new beginning after something has been completed-that is a maturation process, that is progression-and you have new things that begin after you stepped out of something before it is finished. That will always lead to difficulties because the resource, that maturation process, is not being fulfilled. The first line Accumulation, speaks specifically of this.\n\nNeptune exalted. The dissolution of old forms, but not at the expense of valued components that will be retained and transformed. You can see that very clearly in the white book: The pressure to begin something new, not from scratch but based on the foundation of the old. This is the essence of development. The essence of development is that if you can start something and finish it, the next thing you start will even have greater power to be able to go through that process of completion. That leads to the ability to go through the experiential path and truly be of value to humanity by going through that experience from beginning to middle to end, so that we can understand the nature of that experience later. It can be made sense of. It can be shared with us.\n\nVenus in detriment. Development hampered by criticism and the tendency to withdraw rather than make use of these experiences. You get yourself a job and instead of going through the process of really finishing what you started, you jump out in the middle. You will be followed by an aura and a wave of criticism and you carry that with you to the next job. Because you are carrying that energy with you, you are beginning again you are back to square one because you have not developed out of that process. This is the essence of what this hexagram is all about. The essence is: are you mature, or immature? The maturity lies in beginning and completing. The immaturity lies in beginning and jumping out, beginning and jumping out. The whole abstract field is made up of this dichotomy.\n\nSo many people who work with Human Design overlook the obvious. This first line carries with it an obvious mystery. If you have a line that begins with a Neptunian exaltation and you take a look where this gate and its harmonic gate are in the wheel, you can see that Neptune has not been there for about 100 years, Neptune being an outer planet that has a cycle of 165 year. There is nobody alive in the world that carries this vibration. Probably some people who may have lived until their 90's carried it. It is very important to understand that this is not active in the world. The only thing that is active in the world is the other side. We live in a great age of jumping in and out. The foundation is only operating out of one side. Please remember, if you are looking at any line that carries Pluto, Neptune or Uranus, the chances are that it is not active. It may be active in people who are very old. Or it may be gone entirely.\n\nWith Pluto and Neptune, we have long periods of time where the fixing of a line does not exist. This aspect at the beginning is not there. You will not find it in anybody's chart. It is not alive in the world. This is interesting to think about. We live with the consequences of only having a first line that is ruled in our times by the detriment which means that we are here to jump in and out. That is the experience now."

      "hd_title": "Momentum",
      "full_text": "All second lines are projecting outwards. What this line is projecting outwards is the capacity to begin. It always looks like these people can begin something new, which may or may not be appreciated by those around them. If you have a partner that has the 53.2, it may look like your partner is always ready to start a new relationship. Remember that they are a second line. That does not mean that that is true. They may be lucky the first time and after that, they try it 50 more times and it does not work. So it is something to be very clear about in terms of this Momentum. Everything about the nature of this gate is about being so clear that, yes, it is about initiating experience but it is about initiating an experience that can be fulfilled in order to have the strength to initiate a new experience. It is a cycle that is being built up and it is always there as a theme."

      "hd_title": "Practicality",
      "full_text": "The third line, the end of the lower trigram, deals with the theme of trial and error. Trial and error is very much in harmony with the whole process of maturation because maturation is basically a trial and error process, going through one cycle and the next, and learning from your experiences.\n\nIt is called Practicality. Moon exalted. In its most natural position, the concentration on avoiding conflict to ensure protection and continued development. Avoiding conflict works in two ways: these are people that will only begin things when they have harmonic relationships with others. This is a collective stream. And these are people who will leave and walk out on things because it is not harmonic, in order to start something new and to get away from the conflict. These are the kind of people that, when they are in something, the moment that there is any kind of tension or conflict pointed towards them or in the environment around them, they want to get out. So they are driven (the Moon which drives us), they are moved to try to find the right kind of collective force to work with. First to third lines don't know anything about the other side. It is always a surprise. It is always trial and error. It is always full of so-called mistakes.\n\nIn the white book: The pressure to eliminate conflict in order to develop. This means that these people cannot be mature unless they have harmony. This is very important to understand. You have a child with the 53.3 and you have to recognize right away, that they will not develop unless they are in a harmonious relationship and unless there is harmony in their environment. Otherwise they will not develop properly. It is a very important theme for these people. The development is about human evolution and the maturation process within the human way. So you can have a lot of disturbed people. Remember, these format gates carry with them deep depression. This is always a possibility in these gates. It is very important for these children to have harmony around them. When they say that they don't like school because they don't like the fact that there are a lot of people who are fighting and they are uncomfortable with it, you get them out and put them some place else where they can find harmony because without harmony they will not develop.\n\nOn the other side of this, Mars in detriment. The unconscious provoking of conflict that logically threatens security and development. In the white book: Energy which provokes conflict and threatens development. This process with Mars is that because it is trial and error, these people can be very provocative. They are ready to begin something but it is just as likely that it is a bond that they will break. The third lines always have to deal with the conflict theme of others. The exalted has to find a way out of it and the detriment provokes it. One of the things that you find about 53.3's is that they have a genetic strategy in life which is that, whenever they have enough of anything, they instantly provoke conflict and it gives them a rationale to leave, and they walk out to start something new."

      "hd_title": "Assuredness",
      "full_text": "Fourth line, upper trigram. Here we are dealing with being unidirectional. We have the theme of externalization. There is the recognition that there is something else on the other side of the channel. This is in a collective channel and therefore it is inherently social to begin with. That inherently social nature of this channel is the format of the abstract process. You also have to see that this is the format of crisis and of belief systems. This is the format of all of the abstract processes. Conflicts in dealings with others are going to be inherent in it.\n\nThe fourth line, Assuredness is: The ability to maintain the strength of one's individuality in complex and often awkward situations that ensure continued security and development. You notice that 'security', 'development' and 'protection', these terms are all around this. For the abstract being, their cycle is their well-being. If they cannot go through the cycle, they become unhealthy. They must go through the cycle. This is their well-being.\n\nIn the white book: The pressure to maintain one's individuality in confused beginnings. All beginnings are confused. There is no way of knowing where the beginning will lead to. That is the process. That is the mystery. It all begins with its level of confusion. This is the gift here, to be able to be all right in that. It is your beginning. It doesn't matter. It is all confused around you. You have that capacity.\n\nThe other side, the Venus in detriment: The persistent difficulty with embarrassing or awkward situations where normal emotional reactions may prove detrimental. In the white book: Individual pressure for beginnings that creates awkward and sometimes embarrassing situations. Think about what that is like when somebody is one- tracked when it has to do with beginnings. They have to start something new. This can be very uncomfortable and can create all kinds of embarrassing situations. You are in the middle of a dinner and you have guests and all of a sudden you have to start a new chapter in the story that you are writing and you just get up and walk away. Everybody is waiting for dinner to come and you are off. You have gone and are into your thing. You have to start it but it can lead to embarrassing situations.\n\nThe gift here is the Assuredness. When the guests comes sporting into the room and ask what is going on, there is the assuredness to say, \"I had to start this. Sorry.\" This is the one-tracked need to begin. These people are very fixed on it. If you see anybody with the 53.4, the one thing for them to recognize is that, because it is about the abstract process which is deeply related to the emotional system, they have to be very careful in making commitments in relationships. This is a one-tracked mind about beginning things. The moment that anything will go wrong in the relationship, that onetracked mind will start something new. Be very careful about the nature of your commitments because if you are carrying this kind of energy, there is this deep drive inside of you to start something new. That can be a new relationship or a new job. You have to be clear about the authority within yourself that is making a decision to commit yourself to something in order that the energy to be healthy. This is true for the whole gate, but specifically for the fourth line."

      "line": 5,
      "hd_title": "Assertion",
      "full_text": "As I pointed out to you, the first and the fifth line are unusual due to the aspect that they both have Neptunian exaltation. In both cases, this exaltation is not functioning because we don't have Neptune around in anybody alive. Actually, that is probably not true because there are a couple of people around who are over 115 years old. There may be a couple of people that are actually carrying that vibration. There is a guy in Lebanon who is 135 years old. He must have it. There may be a couple of remnants in the world, but what this is saying is much greater for us. Please remember that it is a format energy of our evolutionary process.\n\nThe fifth line, Assertion, has a very beautiful Neptunian exaltation. It says: The underlying and often psychic recognition of the intrinsic values of development that even in periods of isolation has the assertiveness to maintain direction. Its very power garners continued support even from those who are basically opposed. That is very lovely but it does not exist in the world. It will be wonderful when Neptune comes there in the next century and brings back this quality to the experiential way.\n\nThe other thing is that in this assertion, the way in which the fifth line is projected upon is the Earth in detriment, and not on: The pressure to recognize the value of development and the energy for beginnings, regardless of circumstances. What we live with in the world is: Where the energy for beginnings attracts the very forces that can abort them. This is a time of the survival of the fittest. You stand up and say, \"I think it is this,\" and somebody immediately says, \"No. I think it is that.\" This is what we have today and what we had for a long time now as the way in which development is projected upon. Think about what that has done to our civilization in this era.\n\nIn the black book: Earth in detriment. An over-assertiveness that, rather than applied to maintaining support in the face of opposition and isolation, may actually strengthen the opposing forces by its attitude. This is what we have in the world. This attitude of \"I am beginning this and this is the way,\" and somebody opposes. We immediately have a struggle here, and it is the Earth. This is grounding us now. It is the way it is supposed to be now. In the global cycle course that I teach, I talk about the longer-term trends that are there for us. This is a time of great genetic diversity. We have been living in an era of great genetic diversity in which we mix the genetic pools across the planet. V% are having an intellectual diversity that we have never had before. This not being fixed on one way, constantly breaking, jumping in and out, this is the part of the consciousness of the total field now because this is a format energy and they are so important."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Phasing",
      "full_text": "When you look at the sixth line, you see Pluto in detriment which means that we will not experience that either. It does not exist. The 'Department of Planning' always does a good job. You can look at the nature of this hexagram as a format energy to start the experiential way and you see that Neptune is suddenly there. It takes always the exalted in the first and fifth line that turns this beginning process into something that is designed to jump in and out. When you get to the sixth line, the line of transition, it says, \"How can I get through the whole process?\" Remember that this is what a sixth line truly wants to see: \"I begin, and not only do I complete it, I go through the whole thing. I get the fantasy, the feeling, the crisis, the change. I get the philosophy from it. I get the experience and share it in being the prodigal.\" The sixth line in this format is not ready to make any kind of commitment until it really can see that it can complete things, despite Neptune in the first and fifth line.\n\nYou can see that Pluto is: The pressure to hide beginnings in fear of losing past support. The one thing we don't need at this time is somebody who can actually complete things and hides that because everybody else is jumping in and out. We need those examples. If you look at the 10.6, The Role model, you are looking at this sixth line where there is the need to fulfill this.\n\nWith the Moon exalted, it is: The energy to attract support for beginnings based on the success of the past. Only very few of these people who carry the sixth line will begin anything. All they see around them is beginning and jumping out. If they are fortunate enough in their own design to have this sixth line and they are able to begin and complete something, then they have enormous power. Not only can things be begun and completed but that, by its very nature, attracts all these people. Just because Neptune has not activated those two parts in our time does not mean that this collective field does not want to be mature. It does. It is the mechanics that is affecting the maturity. The sixth line is saying, \"Yes, we can do it. If I can do that, you will be attracted to me and if you are attracted to me, we can do it together.\"\n\nOf course, because the theme is so strongly in the jumping in and out, it is not easy for these people to have that ability to go through, nor is it easy for them to meet the others that will allow them to see that it is possible to begin and end something with them. Remember that there is no 42 here. There is just the 53 saying, \"Yes, I can begin things, but can it really be completed?\"\n\nIn the black book: Moon exalted. The successful utilization of the completion of a stage in development, that by its evident success and value can be used as an example to attract support for the next stage."

      "hd_title": "Money isn't everything",
      "full_text": "First lines always describe the nature of a hexagram. It says Money isn't everything. It is very important to understand the nature of this gate. This is an individual power source that is focused on bringing about order through empowering the right direction.\n\nThe recognition that wealth has its own problems. Jupiter exalted. The lust for lucre tempered by higher principals. Mercury in detriment. The delusion that you can throw money at problems. The basis of this hexagram on the exalted side is the desperation to turn the energy into currency. You want that energy to be converted into a successful direction. After all, it is a main tantric channel. In the detriment, there is this sense that you give your energy to others so that they will get you to the right direction. I know so many 14's who look at my 2 and say, \"I have the key and you'll be the driver.\"\n\nIn the white book: The key to manifesting power is higher principles. The higher principle is, \"I am not wasting my energy. I use my energy for the correct direction in my process in order to bring about order.\"\n\nThe other side of this is: Energy alone can never be the key. You can't just pay someone to take you to the right direction. It does not work. You can't just throw your energy at them. Think about the dilemma of the third gate, which is the inherent confusion in the life process. That confusion has not disappeared by the time you get to the 14th gate.\n\nWe are still talking about an unaware center. The 14th gate has all the power within it to drive, but it does not know where to drive. On its own, it can't know where to drive, so there is always a tendency in people with the 14th gate to make attempts at doing things that are not for them, or they will ask other people to take them into that direction.\n\nThere is a helplessness in this Possession in Great Measure. It is important to understand that it is an enormously powerful gate but it is truly vulnerable to being misguided. Remember that the first line is there to understand the nature of the hexagram: it does have this power for direction, but that does not mean that it knows what to do with it. It does not know where it is going in its process."

      "hd_title": "Management",
      "full_text": "When you get to the second line, you get to projection. Instead of being involved in recognizing the nature of one's own power to empower, here is someone who is projecting out that they have that power.\n\nThis line is called Management. It is a joke. The wisdom that investing in expertise brings rewards. First of all, wisdom is something that you do not get right away in life. You may never get it at all. This is an advice to the second line. It says expertise would really help you to find the right direction. When you are dealing with the first three lines, the lower trigram, there is no capacity to understand the nature of the other side. The 14.1, 2 and 3 know at some level that there is this power within them, but they do not know the driver. They always have to meet the driver. They just project out this energy.\n\nJupiter exalted. Expansion. The ability to delegate responsibility. Mars in detriment. The vanity to be one's own best expert. This is individual. Built into their genetic individual material (that means every single genetic gate) is a selfpreservation phenomenon that says, \"Don't interfere with me. Don't take me away from my trip. Don't try to control me. Don't try to condition me.\" All individuality is that way.\n\nWhen you get to the second line, the exalted says: The key to power lies in not trying to be and do everything alone. Remember, that they are projecting out that they have this power. So that is what they assume they can do. \"I have the power and I can get my own direction. Nobody needs to help me.\"\n\nOn the other side: The key to power is doing everything individually. It is Mars. You know, I try very hard to get you to let go of your moralistic judgments about this and that. Mars, in its immaturity, gets a very bad reputation. In this particular line, that immaturity is actually of value because the immaturity says, \"I do not need anybody else. I do have the power. I can do it myself. I know where I will go.\" It does not mean that they do. It still means that they will run into all the problems that second lines run into, which is being found out: big talk about your direction but you do not get there.\n\nBy the way, if someone comes to me for a reading and they have the detriment in that line, I tell them, \"Be your own expert, no matter what happens.\" That is their nature. None of this is about seeing any of those aspects as being less, or missing, or wrong. It is exactly what the genetic information within them demands, in that sense."

      "hd_title": "Service",
      "full_text": "When you get to the third line, you get to Service. By the way, people who have the 14th gate always have a great deal of power within them and they are often very successful materially in their process because that power does convert. When they find the right direction they can always turn that energy into currency. They can always turn that energy into what looks after them.\n\nWhen you come to the third line, you come to the process of trial and error in life. The whole thing for the 14 is to recognize that the only way for them to get through the whole process, ultimately, is to find some way to externalize that energy as service.\n\nThe utilization of talent and wealth for the highest good. This channel leads to the 8/1 which is the Creative Role Model. Individuality is never about being best. It is about being different. The wealth and talent of any individual lies in the glorification of their own individuality and their identification with their individuality, so that they can be different.\n\nEarth exalted. Selfless contribution to society. That sounds very nice. It does not mean that it is going to work. It does not mean that they will be rewarded, because they will make mistakes. \"I will give my energy to the anarchist movement.\" That service to any kind of higher principle (by the way, those are relative terms) is going to be filled with trial and error and these people will offer their energy to different drivers until they have the experience to recognize which driver can really be good for them.\n\nNeptune in detriment. Greed and the self-destruction of moral fiber. This line is deeply misunderstood. The greed of this line is what you see at the very top, 'The accumulation and retention of power'. If you are holding all this power inside of you and you do not find a way to release it, it will make you ill. It is the greed of saying, \"I am not going to provide you with that energy.\" It is like driving up to a gas station with your car and the car is empty. You push it in and the gas station attendant looks at you and says, \"No. I want to keep this gasoline because my car can run out of gasoline. You'd better push your car some place else.\"\n\nThe 'moral fiber' is in the sense of how society will react to that kind of holding back of all of that energy: by condemning it. If somebody has this line, it does not mean that it is a negative. It means that is the way in which they are going to come to grips with this process of trial and error.\n\nRemember, everything about the 14th hexagram is dependent on wisdom, which comes later. So, what these people end up being very good at, late in life, is being the ones who know that there will always be the possibility for a perfect place to put their energy. It is deep inside. It does not get to manifest until the resonance in the sixth line. In reality, there is this touch of it underneath where they say, \"Aha, I am actually holding on to all of this money so that I can give it away to a really good cause, but I have not found the cause yet. If I do find it, I will give it all away.\" Bill Gates said: \"I am too young to give away my money, and I do not know what to give it to. \" Holding on with the potential that it can be of service."

      "hd_title": "Security",
      "full_text": "The 14th gate may not be aware. The nature of the fuel conditions the direction. Think about it as the difference between a vegetarian and a carnivore. A vegetarian 14 or a carnivore 14 will push you in different directions because you have to shop in different places to fulfill that energy. It may not be aware, but it will change the direction just out of the very nature of the energy. When you come to the fourth line, you come to the first possibility to be able to go across the channel to recognize that one has to deal with the other side: that there is a driver.\n\nThe first thing that this is all about is the skill of being able to fix your power and show it on the outside. The fourth line is always about being one-directional, being focused, being fixed. It is taking an aspect out of the foundation of its nature and it is fixing it. The concentration on establishing a strong foundation.\n\nMoon exalted. Protection from assault. These are people that project out their power in a very fixed way. It is very difficult to take these people away from that. This is their thing.\n\nMars in detriment. Overconfidence in meeting the challenge of competition that may threaten the very basis of security.\n\nThey are so fixed in their power, one way. The inability to recognize one's own nature projecting outwards can lead to very bizarre and dangerous paths."

      "hd_title": "Arrogance",
      "full_text": "In the fifth line you come to a field that is being projected upon. That is why the line is called Arrogance. The ever present risk inherent in positions of power. It does not mean that you are in a position of power. It means that everybody assumes that you are in a position of power. When you meet a 14.5, you assume that they are powerful. This is how you project onto their energy. They may or may not be powerful.\n\nSun exalted. Innate dignity. The only protection for an individual who is projected upon as being powerful is that they'd better mind their p's and q's, or other people will gang up on them and check out that power to find out how long it takes to nail them to the cross.\n\nVenus in detriment. A dissatisfaction with the gifts of others that creates feelings of superiority. You get projected on that you have the power to provide the energy for direction, but people will provide the link. This is a transpersonal process, the 14 with the 2, and the 2 becomes the driver. The 14 is sitting there saying. \"I am giving this one all this fuel and this is where they take me? I don't think that they are good drivers. I don't think they know where they are going.\" Out of that comes the sense of, \"They are not very important. They are not very good at what they are doing. They are limited in their capacity.\" This is the other side. The fifth is always being projected on. The world sees power as arrogance."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Humility",
      "full_text": "When you get to the sixth line you get to the end of a process, so you go beyond the nature of the hexagram itself. We saw that, whenever we were looking at the sixth line of any gate, it is pointed towards the first line of the next gate, which is the 34.1, in this case. They are deeply related to each other. There is such a mystery in following the movement of the wheel to understand what is really going on inside of us. The 34 is about keeping us alive.\n\nHere, in the sixth line, you have Humility. That is where you go from the projection of Arrogance. The 14.5 that is clear about the nature of its energy and that has a lousy driver, has every right in the world to think that this driver doesn't know where they are going. That is not arrogance. That is the 14.5 refusing to be the victim of the 3.5, the theme of which was Victimization. The 14.5 says, \"I am not going to be your victim. If you want all my power, you are seducing me, so you'd better take me to the right place.\" When you get to the sixth line, all that stuff is over. Here, you have the humility that recognizes very clearly that it has power. Right after that it says, \"So what?\" The fulfillment of that power can never be that person's own.\n\nRemember the nature of the knowing circuit. In order for it to be fulfilled, it is not possible for one human being to carry within them that activation. It is not possible. It is: \"Where are we going on this road?\"\n\nWhere every individual goes is silence. This is path of all individuality: to the silence of coming to the point where what is knowable is known. The 14.6 wants to know that the direction it takes through that relationship goes where it needs to go, in order for it to know its own nature and the value of its movement through space. But all sixth lines stand back and say, \"Yes, but I'll wait. This is God's will.\" This is the existential reality. This is not about being selective. This is not about looking for drivers. This is about it happening and the good fortune that one can see in that, finally, there is this possibility."

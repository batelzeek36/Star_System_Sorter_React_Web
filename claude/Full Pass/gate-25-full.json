      "full_text": "The first line always gives you the foundation. This first line in particular is something that is very profound and, when you get into its deepest levels, you really begin to recognize the nature of what universal love is all about. The first line is called Selflessness. Here we are in the self.\n\nThe 25 is pointed towards the most dynamic willpower in the body. It is pointed towards the deepest sense of ego power because the will in the 51 is an enormous thing, and that will is deeply possessive. \"I am the power,\" says the 51, and the 25 says, \"No, the power exists.\" The 25 is selfless in the sense that it is not going to claim ego power. The 51 says \"I am the jumper,\" and the 25 says \"There is only the jump.\" There is no claim, no possessiveness here. One cannot possess the universe. Motiveless action.\n\nHere, we come to a very important impact in the genetic continuity of the global program because, in the 25.1 and the 25.3, we have lines that are impacted by the fact that neither Neptune nor Pluto has been in Aries for a very long time. The 25/51 is an Arian channel and both Pluto and Neptune have been far away from being able to activate this channel of Initiation for many years. (Please see the section on Outer Planet Transits in the Glossary in Volume 2.)\n\nThe first thing to recognize about Selflessness is that the overview is motiveless action. It is something that has to be learned. It is an overview. We are all conditioned to be motivated, all of us. We are conditioned to have a motive. If you do this, you get that. We are always conditioned by motivation. Neptune exalted. The universalization of activity. Psychic attunement that is its own reward. This line does not exist in the world. Neptune will get there in about 30 years, probably around the time that the cycle changes (2027). Pluto will be in Aries in 2080.\n\nWhat we have is the Mercury in detriment. It is the only thing that is active in the first line and remember that this is the foundation. This is the foundation of what selflessness is in our age. It is: A tendency to publicize one's selflessness. Mother Teresa, Princess Diana, all this propaganda about how selfless one is. It is not enough to be a quiet philanthropist. Everyone has to blow their philanthropic horn. That is, everybody is making a claim about their selflessness. \"Look how selfless I am. Look, I have no motive. I am just a wonderful person.\"\n\nIn the white book: The potential for centering through attunement to challenges. That does not exist. We don't have that. There will be a generation born with it some day, but what we are dealing with now is: The insecurity of the Self manifested in times of challenge. That is very productive for us. We live in an era where the Self is insecure and so we have an enormous movement throughout the world that people try to secure their identity. \"Who am I? What am I? Where am I? Is there a motive? Is only God great?\" You can see that the detriment here is one of the keys to the revival of fundamentalism and theocracies in the world, this lack of identity being imprinted by old religious symbols onto people.\n\nThe insecurity of the Self manifested in times of challenge. Challenge is a keynote for the channel. That is, the competitiveness that lies in initiation always has to deal with the challenge of the ego that must be met. What happens here in the challenge from the ego is that the selflessness is there, but it always has to be expressed because there is uncertainty about the quality of identity. In other words, the identity is not strong enough just to be silently motiveless, that identity has to be able to say, \"Look what I have done. Ain't I terrific? I hope that they are going to make me a saint.\"\n\nThis is lower trigram, so it does not know that the 51 and its power is there. It can be quite shocking, obviously, to meet that and the spirit of the Self is always challenged by that shock. So, the first thing to recognize is that we live in a time in which the global identity is very weak, because this is the foundation of the Self in our era. \"Please, Master, tell me who I am.\" During the transit of Mercury, we may discover what selflessness is, which means to recognize the motives that are at the root of our actions. It may seem selfless, but in reality is not."

      "hd_title": "The Existentialist",
      "full_text": "In these gates of love, we will see that we have certain lines which are unusual in their performance or values. This second line is particularly so. It embodies the nature of what innocence really is. Innocence is only possible existentially. There is no other way to be innocent. Following what we have seen about collective love, that collective love is rooted in being oneself: selflessness, motivelessness, is rooted in the now. Only in the now is one free of guile.\n\nThe Existentialist. Devotion and dedication to the now. Like all lower trigrams, the motivelessness is only broken by the other side stepping in because this is the nature of the hexagram. The motivelessness is there naturally - it is only broken by the other side stepping in. In this moment, what has been motiveless and selfless can take on another nature. When somebody says to you, \"You are so selfless,\" that is the moment that your selflessness begins to disappear.\n\nMercury exalted. The perfection of the intellect through concentration and focus on what is, rather than on what could be or has been. If you look inside the 25.2, you see somebody who is just in the now. They don't know why they are doing the things that they do. They are just there in that process. This does not mean that that is intellectual, or that they have that intellectual capacity. That is, some will and some won't. It will depend on their design and on whom they meet. But the fact of the matter is that the longer the 25.2 is allowed to be in its motivelessness, the more it will come to recognize ultimately, at the intellectual level, what it means to be surrendered. Again, this is the nature of what universal love is all about. Universal love is the acceptance that we are helpless in all of this and that all you can do is to not interfere but be right there in the now.\n\nOn the other side, Mars in detriment, which by its very nature is immature. A dedication that can never be free of personal motivation and its attendant projections. This is because of others. This is the moment where the 25.2 is seen by somebody for what they are. \"Oh, you have been so motiveless, so selfless, but really, you should be rewarded.\" It is not that they just do this for nothing. They don't even know what they are doing.\n\nThey are just in it, but the outside force is going to come on them and because of that, this projection comes in. With projection, there is this mixing of terms where, all of a sudden, the individual, like the abstract, is suddenly trying to figure out what the pattern is going to be. \"If I stay selfless, I will become a saint.\" That can only come from the outside coming in.\n\nIn the white book: The innocence of the Self and its protection can only be maintained in the now. Because this is an overview line, these people are pulled out of the now all the time. When they are pulled out of the now, they are shocked. Often it is projected on them that they had a motive all along, but they did not.\n\nThe whole thing to see is that the love that can be generated out of these gates is what has been generated for the benefit of the totality. It comes out of the individual, but it is there for the global whole. This 25.2 is a very beautiful motivelessness but, of course, it has to meet the world and because it is not equipped to deal with the world, it can end up losing its innocence, which means it loses its existential nature."

      "hd_title": "Sensibility",
      "full_text": "The trial and error line is a deeply mystical line and, as such, it has quite a different value, in a way, at the mystical level. It is an overview line. Sensibility. The recognition that innocent action does not in itself guarantees success. This is not the 46. In my work with people, because I am somebody with the 25.3 and the 51, I keep on reminding them that life is not about being happy. It is not about being successful. It is not about any of those things because all of those things carry with them expectations, motivations and rewards. It is simply about living your life; that is all.\n\nOne of the things that you learn in the 46th gate is that if you do live out your nature, you can be lucky. That is, good things can come to you as well as bad things. But at least those things belong to you. So, innocent action, being innocent, does not mean that life will be a success. By being existential, that does not mean necessarily that you are going to be happy or sad.\n\nRemember that this is individual and individual is melancholic and melancholy is about happy and/or sad. It does not mean that life is going to be wonderful just because you are innocent. It can be a horror. There are so many human beings in the world that are forced to live existentially and live at the edge of society, moment by moment by moment. It can be a very unpleasant thing. Nonetheless, by living existentially, one opens up the possibility for universal love in the world. This is the real surrender. Not \"my will be done,\" but \"thy will be done.\" This is just to be here in the wave.\n\nThe nature of this line: this is a very profound line for our time because it is an indication that we live in an era, up until 2080, in which it is really possible for us to transcend trial and error and reach wisdom. The reason for that is that we do not have the detriment in this line.\n\nPluto in detriment. The potential loss of innocence through misfortune that in the extreme can manifest from crime to suicide. Jiirgen and I went looking back to the era where Pluto was in Aries and was activating this line. We looked for famous people. There were none. The only thing that we could find for that date is the Brazilian Republic which I think lasted two years. Around this time, in 1820, we had the growth of prisons. This was a direct result of Pluto being in the 25.3.\n\nBy the way, I want to add to my comment about the ego in this line in terms, of doing analysis for people. If -you see somebody with a 25.3 who has an open ego, it does not work the same way. The 25.3 without the power of the ego to be able to withstand the shock is going to have problems with its innocence. It will get through because of the inactive Plutonic side, but the fact is that the ego is mentioned in Ibis way here. It is essential to understand that a strong ego is something very important in that kind of configuration. We live in pan era in which the shattering of innocence does not (lead to failure and crime, does not lead to abuse, but does lead 'to what is always present in the 25th gate, which is (blood. This is the gate of blood. This is the gate of the spirit of the life, the spiriit in the blood.\n\nWhat we have instead of this Pk*omic detriment is a Mars exalted. 'The power of the ,Ego... Right away, we have something interesting here because -we have been seeing -all along that whenever the ego is imemtiomed, we get to see a detrimental impact on the nature of the Self. In other words, we get to see the Self trying to be possessive and claim something, instead of just accepting the nature of what is. But here we have something very different: Mars exalted and particularly at its best in this sense. (Mars is exalted in Aries anyway.) ... to withstand failure and still maintain its nature.\n\nIn my work, I have analyzed all kinds of things in the nature of my life and obviously, I paid a lot of attention to imy experience with the Voice and the mechanisms at work. There is no question for me that my survival of that was rooted in the fact that I have the 25.3, one of the many things that kept me alive in that experience so that I was not destroyed. The fact that there was no Pluto there. The fact that there was no possibility of that really becoming not only shattered by the experience, but criminal.\n\nWith the knowledge that I was given, I could have stayed secretly a black magician. I still could. The knowledge that I was given, the things that I was told that I could do, the things that were possible with the knowledge that was given to me; but I do not live in a Plutonic age where that criminality is something possible, out of that shattering in the trial and error.\n\nRemember that the third line does not know that there is something on the other side. It is not transpersonal. It is different when you have the whole channel. That is what Initiation is all about. It is about the recognition of that. But the fact is that the third line, by itself, does not know that. In the white book: The power of the spirit to withstand failure and shock. Failure in its motiveless action: in other words, that motiveless action suddenly is something that just falls apart. All right, that motiveless action has to meet a more powerful force and is shocked. All right, it will find a way to maintain its innocence, regardless of that."

      "full_text": "The 46.4 is an exalted fourth line. It is the line of Impact. This 25.4 is its polarity; it is exactly opposite the 46.4, and it is one of the most exalted lines that we are going to find. It is one these rare lines that has a double exaltation, like in the 11.4. So you notice that in fourth lines, there are some very important attributes simply because fourth lines can have a great deal of influence because they are one-tracked and fixed on their process and they are transpersonal. Remember that this is the only gate of the Self pointed to the ego and the relationship between the Self and the ego is one of the most important within our vehicle. So, when you have a transpersonal line in the 25th gate, this 25.4 knows the ego on the other side, knows what that ego is and what its power presents, and in that sense, it has the capacity over time.\n\nThis is an overview line: The nature of true innocence can be maintained regardless of circumstances. The nature of true motivelessness. Here are people that are fixed (this is the harmony to the first line) and one-tracked in their selflessness and, of course, this is the great exaltation. Again, because of the overview line, you do not start off that way.\n\nVenus exalted. The beauty of the rose in the garbage dump. One of my favorite lines in the Rave I Ching: the beauty of the rose in the garbage dump, just for what it is. The manifestation, the one-trackedness, of innocence can exist in any kind of decadence. It makes no difference.\n\nIn the white book: The spiritual warrior, the innocence maintained regardless of circumstances. Jupiter is also exalted. What you have is that Venus establishes our basic morals and Jupiter writes the law. The two of them together establish the framework of how societies and communities function. These two together in this line, and we find them together in the fifth line again, is a very important connection. Whenever you see Venus and Jupiter together in a line you know that is has a very strong impact on the way society sees and functions. The highest principles even amongst the greatest decadence. There is no significant difference in this language.\n\nThere is no planet in detriment. What we have here is not only a fourth line that is by its very nature fixed and onetracked, but by the nature of the line itself is fixed and one -tracked. There is only exaltation. There is only this ability to maintain innocence regardless of the circumstance. A very beautiful line.\n\nThe wonderful thing about being one -tracked is if it stays on the track, it will arrive, like a train when it is on the track: it will arrive. That is a security. The whole thing about being one -pointed when you are here in an existentialist line is that, no matter what happens to you, you are always remaining existentialist; that is the value here."

    {
      "line": 5,
      "hd_title": "Recuperation",
      "full_text": "It is a very strange line. If the 46.5 is the weakest of the fifth lines, well, the 25.5 is not far behind. That is, this is a line that is weak for a reason, in the sense that the only time that most human beings are existential is when they are sick. Think about that. Think about the last time that you were ill. You were right there in the sickness. You can't escape it. It is unpleasant. You don't like it. It does not allow you to focus on the future. It does not really allow you to reflect on the past. It just keeps you stuck at being sick and, in being sick, you are in the now and, in being in the now, you are finally being yourself.\n\nMost human beings never come to themselves until they are sick. They do not come to themselves until they are sick because the sickness that they have is because they are not themselves in the first place. Because of that, in trying to heal themselves of that sickness, they are actually trying to come back to themselves, without understanding it. The moment that somebody recovers from an illness is a moment that they can start again to be themselves.\n\nOf course, they immediately go out and take on the same kind of conditioning again and get sick again. When they get sick again, they get thrown into the existential plane again, so they heal themselves on the existential level. There is no other way to heal other than in the now because you know that you can't get out until you are better. There is nothing you can do but be there.\n\nSo, this is a very strange line. It is a great line of projection. Everybody is lo8king to that fifth line and projecting onto that innocence and motivelessness. \"You are the innocent one. You are the motiveless one. You have the spirit that I, or humanity, could use.\" The now is about being healthy.\n\nRecuperation. When innocence is sapped of its vitality, healing... (This is the only line that speaks of healing.) ... is the first priority. When somebody projects onto you, remember the harmony to the second line and the problems with being brought to a place of motivation by others; here it is even stronger. What you have here is other people wanting to project onto your innocence, wanting your innocence to be their spirit. That takes strength away and, in taking vitality away, it takes away the vitality to be innocent in the now, and the only way that you can avoid that is to withdraw.\n\nVenus exalted. The ability to recognize the inner meaning of an affliction and to withdraw until it is healed. In the white book: The power of the spirit to heal and be healed. Only when you are in the now, only when you are being in the experience of your body, only when you are accepting your rhythm are you healthy.\n\nThe mystery of this line is that healing oneself is about withdrawal from conditioning. This is what healing is about: to withdraw from conditioning and to heal the conditioners. Jupiter in detriment. Hypochondria and the need to be healed by others. This is something very important to understand. The moment that your innocence is sapped of its vitality and the moment that somebody is projecting onto your spirit, in that moment, you take in their conditioning and in the moment that you go for their conditioning, you become the sick one and they have to heal you. They, of course, heal you with what does not belong to you and so you stay the sick one.\n\nIt is so important to understand what healing is really all about, that there is no need for anyone to be healed as long as they are not taken away from their nature. The moment innocence is sapped of its vitality, disease is in the world. So what that means is that as long as we are not being innocent, as long as we are not being what we are, we create disease, we create illness, and it is a self-serving process.\n\nAfter all, disease is one of the greatest employers in the world: hospitals, doctors, homeopaths, medicines, factories, recuperations, spas, healers. All of that comes back to the same thing. Universal love is getting down and realizing, \"Hey, it is not up to me. All I have to do is to accept what it is to be me and I am going to be fine. But the moment I try to be something else, the moment I try to accept the conditioning to be something else, is the moment that I bring sickness into the world.\"\n\nIf you don't live out your rhythm, you take love away from the world. If you don't live in your body and accept what it is to live in your body, you take away the capacity for success for humanity. The moment that you do not live selflessly, motiveless, you bring disease into the world.\n\nIn the white book: The weakness of the spirit which requires healing from others. The fifth line is the line of priesthood and doctors. It is the priesthood of the healing shaman. It is the priesthood of blame, the blame that says, \"You are sick because of this or that.\" That is both positive and negative. In other words, sometimes it is the truth and sometimes it is sheer nonsense. This is one of the ways to try to find out how we can be healthy. One of the things you will find about 25.5's is that they tend to be sickly."

      "hd_title": "Ignorance",
      "full_text": "Like any of these sixth lines we are dealing with, it is something that is outside of the basic nature of a hexagram. It is withdrawn from it. It is sitting above. Keep in mind that all of these sixth lines are going to flower soon. That is, when we step into the next cycle in 2027 and we are living in a sixth line- instead of a first line-theme, this is going to be the flowering of that: the opening up of the emotional spirit through the 55.6 and the beginning of a process in which sixth lines are going to come into a different epoch and really be part of their time. So we are in a developmental process towards that time where sixth lines come down from their roof tops and get involved.\n\nEverything about the nature of the 25th gate started in the overview of the lines in the first place. It said: The perfection of action.... When you come to the 25.6, you are dealing with a line that has a deep perspective: it can look into the centering circuit. It can look into Integration. It can look into the whole individual process and, as such, its vision, its ideal, is enormous by comparison. In order for it to make a commitment to anything, it has to see that the value of mutation is there. Without mutation, motiveless action does not mean anything. The whole substance then becomes useless. What action? What is the action that requires us to be motiveless? What action is the perfection of motivelessness?\n\nI am not somebody who spends much time, since the last 10 or 15 years, with what other people think about the nature of what it is to be, but it is one of those extraordinary questions and so many great thinkers are trying to come up with a formula. For me, it is clear that I am choiceless. It is the only thing that I can see as the simplest way of discovering what it is to be. For me, here, in this sixth line, lies the possibility to recognize choicelessness and to see that action is not something that has to be contemplated, but action is something simply to be accepted, to be accepted without motive.\n\nIgnorance. False innocence betrayed by actions. The Earth exalted. The milder of a negative position, where inappropriate action is censured. These children find out very quickly that, no matter how innocent they are, if the actions are not right, they get to suffer a great deal and they become very careful, later in their life, about what kind of action they engage in, to the point that they do not engage in action at all.\n\nUranus in detriment. Constant inappropriate and destabilizing actions whose very counter-productiveness strips away the facade of innocence. It is not enough to be motiveless in one's spirit. One's actions have to be pure and unmotivated. They simply have to be a by-product of being.\n\nIn the white book: The loss of innocence through inappropriate action, or Constant inappropriate action in times of challenge that can break the spirit. The 25.6 goes to the 17.1, which is all about collecting endless amounts of opinions. It is an openness to all kinds of stimuli. In other words: what has the 25.6 to do? My god, there are a lot of actions in the world. There are so many different ways, different formulas. The 17th gate is the great gate of organizing humanity. That is what it is there for. It comes back to the question of: what is innocence? The 25.6 can always look at the activities of others and they see clearly whether they are motivated or innocent. It can always tell. It has quite a gift in that sense. But for itself, it is a very difficult process. Only when they see that action can be motiveless, only then it is possible for them. It has to be concretized in their opinion. In other words, they have to see its value to humanity. They have to see that it has a mutative quality.\n\nThese people often have their innocence broken but fortunately for them, they do not have the harmony to the 3 in detriment because Pluto is not there, so they do not suffer deeply in their innocence being broken. They simply pull away and withdraw. Withdrawal is one of the secrets of the 25th gate. Somebody who only has the 25 has to learn to move themselves away from others. When I was giving name-groupings for various hexagrams and I was putting together the hexagrams of aloneness (the 12, 33, 40)1 was very tempted to add the 25. I did not because I thought it would confuse people. It is so important to understand that the 25th gate is only at its best when it is alone because then it is innocent.\n\nLimitation is everything for humanity. Limitation (the 60th gate, part of the individual circuitry) says that there is a structure for everything. The only thing to recognize is the structure. Once you understand the nature of structure, then you can find a way to see that whatever moves through that structure will be a polarity, a binary like everything else in life, but the structure is the framework. The framework for a 25, the structure, in the language of individuality in the 43/ 23, is that when innocence is sapped of vitality, withdraw. Withdrawal means so much to innocence because it brings one back to the self.\n\nThis is being in the cave, all by themselves. All that they say is, \"I am now.\" They are pure innocence. Withdrawal and aloneness have enormous value to the 25. The 25.6 is great at being a fool on the hill, totally away from everything and quite common, in this day and age, watching television. Their favorite line then is, \"look at that phony.\""

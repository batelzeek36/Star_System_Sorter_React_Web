      "hd_title": "Disengagement",
      "full_text": "It is called Disengagement. The basis of provocation is to back away. This is one of the deepest provocations of all. Think about what that means, genetically. The moment that the 39 disengages, there is no mutation.\n\nMars exalted. The determination when confronted by obstacles to withdraw, but only temporarily. Understand the nature of the foundation. It is looking inward. It is trying to understand what provocation is and, the moment that it provokes, the moment that it is dealing with its capacity to provoke, it always ends up in situations where that leads to a reaction and they withdraw, but only temporarily. In other words, they will go through it again and again.\n\nThe energy to provoke by refusing to confront obstacles. The obstacle is the resulting provocation in the other. Think about that. When you are provoking somebody, you tease them. What you are teasing is that you need to get exactly the right potential for that teasing. Not everybody will respond in the same way.\n\nThose people who will be provoked by that teasing are not for you, but you have to find who is for you. Thus, you keep on provoking and every time you meet the obstacle, their response to that provocation, you back away and try to find another one.\n\nYou are looking for the spirit. Understand that the 39th gate is a gate that has deep inside of it the only instrument that is out there to look for the spirit. When these human beings stop provoking, we have less and less people who are looking for the spirit. For every 39, there is a resonance in the world. The spirit can be found but it is a research, after all.\n\nMercury in detriment. Disengagement, with an accompanying indecision as to when to re engage. There is a good sound biological reason why the foundation for this gate which is seeking to find the spirit for mutation, is being held back in this disengagement, because we do not want all kinds of mutations in the world. Just because something is a mutation, it will not inherently guarantee that it is a good mutation. It can be a bad one. A bad mutation is when the 39 provokes someone and they try to stay instead of withdrawing when this person gets provoked. Thus, you will have a negative mutation right away and it will manifest in the quality of that relationship because it then is contentious, caught in the mood swing and the spirit is not there, but only the motor. This is a way of holding back from too many mutations.\n\nThe value of this kind of education is when people who carry the energy of the 39 begin to recognize the value of what that gate is. In order to do so, they all have to develop what I call a thick skin. If you provoke somebody and they get provoked, you know that they are not for you. They will put up an energy vibration that is sent towards you which says, \"This person is a provoker and this person is not nice,\" or other gossip told. If people talk about the 39 behind their back or into their face, they do not necessarily like that.\n\nThis is the whole thing about being a 39. That is why there are so few people in the world that are truly looking for the spirit. Most of them are engaged in disengagement. They are pulling back. They provoke, they get the reaction and then pull away. This is what most of the planet is doing with this energy."

      "hd_title": "Confrontation",
      "full_text": "The second line is always projecting outwards. The 39.2 is projecting outwards that they are provocative and therefore, other people can treat them accordingly and respond, even when they are not provocative. What happens to these people is that, because everybody responds to that provocation, they end up having to deal with it a lot.\n\nThe second line is called Confrontation. That is what they get. By the way, you can notice that the second, the fourth and the sixth line have the Moon exalted. One of the easiest ways of thinking of the Moon is to recognize that it is what moves and drives us. When the Moon is exalted, this is a very powerful force because we get a constant cycle every 28 days of the Moon coming back to this line and reinforcing this, or when it is at the other side of the definition.\n\nHere, The instinctual and direct assault of obstacles. These people are projected on that they are provocative. You are sitting with somebody who is describing to you what the ABC is. The 39.2 is sitting there and does not say a single word, does not stare, does not look funny, does not make any motions, does not do anything, and the person who just described the ABC turns to the 39.2 and says, \"What is the matter with that?\" The 39.2 inside is saying, \"What me?\" and starts stuttering some excuse. What is necessary is the direct assault on the obstacle: \"Nothing. I was not paying any attention to you.\" They get this presumption all the time, this projection that they are ready to be provocative.\n\nIn the white book: The energy to provoke through direct assault. These are people that have to deliver this direct assault. They have people coming right at them and say, \"Why are you looking at me so strange?\" \"I am not looking at you at all.\" This answer is just as provocative in response. They give the direct assault back.\n\nJupiter in detriment. The principle of preservation that tempts one to go around an obstacle that should be tackled headon. In the white book: An emotional discomfort when direct assault is essential. Think about what happens to these people. They are so used to being picked on because that is how they feel. They feel like they are being picked on. \"Why do you pick on me? I did not say anything. I did not look at you funny. I did not do anything. Leave me alone.\" The people with the Jupiter in detriment get the direct assault and they do everything in their power to get away from that provocation. They do not go right back and say, \"You idiot. Why do you look at me?\" They try to say, \"Really, no, no. Did I look like that? I did not mean to. I am really sorry that you thought that I thought that you are funny.\" These people get very angry. The other person will find that answer just as provocative as the direct assault. The 39 never gets outside of the game."

      "hd_title": "Responsibility",
      "full_text": "We come to the completion of the lower trigram, to the trial and error process, to the learning process. This is the resonance to the sixth line and the potential of wisdom. The third line is called Responsibility and here you begin to see the root of what will ultimately be, in the 39.6, the fuel for the 55.6, which will lead to the mutation.\n\nThis is the trial and error process of learning to get to this point, and the first thing that we see in this is: The avoidance of confronting obstacles if failure puts others at risk. This 'others at risk' sounds strange because we are dealing with an individual fuel in an individual channel and circuit. Yet, built into it is a genetic recognition of the power of mutation to change everything, either positively or negatively.\n\nWe have Jupiter in detriment. The great benefic whose first consideration is for the larger framework. In the white book: The energy to provoke through self-sacrifice. For example, you have a teacher who is bullying the children in the classroom, provoking them, and you have one child who carries this 39.3 energy who will make the sacrifice in order to protect the others. They will go up to that teacher and challenge him. This child will get into trouble, will have to leave the school, will be punished. If this child will not make this self-sacrifice, others will be at risk.\n\nThe responsibility in the third line is this early recognition of the responsibility of being a mutative force. That responsibility is not simply for the individual. Sometimes the provocation has to be for the benefit of others. These are the people in any kind of group situation that do the provoking for others. They, themselves, might well prefer not to get involved because trial and error means mistakes and punishment. But because nobody can, they do, because is built in.\n\nThe Earth in detriment. The often disastrous assumption that others are more at risk if an obstacle is not confronted. The white book: The energy to provoke through the failure to make sacrifices. They do not make the sacrifice and provoke others through that behavior. In the same situation in the classroom, the capacity to provoke on behalf of everyone, but not doing it. This is extremely individual.\n\nThe third line is starting the process of seeing that the individual mutation always has to be ready for sacrifice, always. The moment that you have a mutative force in the world, there are forces that want to destroy it. All individuals, as freaks, are subject to being stoned and, the moment that one is ready to make a mutative provocation for the benefit of others, it becomes the focus of that field of energy. Sacrifice is built into bringing mutation. There is no mutation without sacrifice."

      "hd_title": "Temperance",
      "full_text": "We come to the fourth line, to the beginning of the upper trigram. It is about being unidirectional; it is about being fixed and one-minded. This fourth line is one of the great lines of the 384 lines. It is such a complex line. Even the language of this line, its keynotes come from everywhere.\n\nThe fourth line is called Temperance. It sounds very much like the introduction to the 12th hexagram. Careful evaluation and assessment before taking action. Before provoking. The nature of the gate is not about doing; it is about provoking.\n\nMoon exalted. The values of feelings and instincts in establishing the proper timing. Feelings have nothing to do with this stream. Instincts have nothing to do with this stream, either. Timing has nothing to do with this stream. We have already looked at the abstract, the tribal and the collective in that one sentence. Three keynotes from three different fields is a very complex energy.\n\nThe values of feelings and instincts in establishing the proper timing. This means: when to provoke. Understand the beauty of this line. This line is the first time that we can go across the channel. It has the recognition that there is something else on the other side of the channel. The moment that it recognizes the forces on the other side, it says, \"Oh. There is a big emotional motor over there and it is going up and down in a wave. If I don't choose the right time, I will never get the right spirit.\"\n\nIn terms of the white book: The energy to provoke at exactly the right time. This is the magic and the fixation of the fourth line: when is the right time? Because of that, they externalize at different times until they learn. These are the kind of people that only provoke you on Mondays or when you tell them that you have a headache. They find out at what time to provoke you to get a maximum impact, to see whether or not you have the right spirit.\n\nThe other side of this energy has the Sun in detriment. The faulty belief that willpower alone can overcome any obstacle regardless of circumstances. 'Willpower': this keynote belongs to the tribal circuitry. You see that this energy is very complex. You have all kinds of keynotes coming from the whole body graph. This whole field is the fuel for mutation. It is not the fuel to initiate mutation. It is not the 3/60. It is the fuel to bring that mutation out into the world and allow it to spread. It is very powerful in that sense.\n\nIn the white book: The energy to provoke that ignores circumstances. This energy does not wait for the right time. These people end up being a pain in the neck because they are always provoking you at the wrong time. If it is the right time to provoke somebody when they have a headache, do not provoke them when they do not have one because you will get crushed. You keep on persisting to provoke them whenever you feel like it, instead of recognizing that there is a right time for that."

      "hd_title": "Single-mindedness",
      "full_text": "The fifth line is always being projected upon, so anybody that carries this fifth line is projected on as being provocative. Due to that projection, they do not have to provoke very much because people get out of their way, unless they are really looking for a fight. So, people avoid getting involved at any kind of difficult level with the 39.5 people.\n\nThis line is called Single-mindedness. The rare ability not to overcome but to bypass obstacles. There is no one to be provoked out there, in that sense. They do not get a chance. What happens to these people is that they very rarely find the right spirit. This is a time that we are living in. The 39 provokes to find the spirit. That is its true nature. That is the first line. The fifth line is how everybody else sees it. How everybody else sees it as wrong. What they see is that provocation should not be necessary and it is something to be avoided. If provocation is avoided, no spirit can be found. These people are projected on that they are single-minded, that they are the ones that can get it done. They do not run into any problems because they do not get the constant provocation because other people are very aware of this capacity in them.\n\nNeptune exalted. The imagination to establish new patterns that make the obstacles irrelevant. The moment that the obstacles are irrelevant, the spirit is gone. Think about that. The moment that it is projected on you that you are provocative, so \"let's not provoke them,\" there is no chance to find the spirit. But this is what the totality wants out of that fifth line. This is their projection on what this fuel is all about.\n\nThe Mars in detriment. Simple hardheadedness. Though less exalted, it can often result in success and gather support by its very determination. It is amazing how many people are mutated by these 39.5's because, rather than going through the provocation with them, they just accept whatever it is in the mood, and they can often pull people along with them, but the spirit is missing. This is the whole thing. It is so important that when you are working with people that have the 39th gate, that they truly understand what provocation is for. It is there to find the right spirit. The right spirit is the spirit that is not provoked. You can cheat by doing the fifth line number. The fifth line number is, \"Let's see. There does not seem to be any provocation out there, so everything is okay\" It does not work that way."

      "hd_title": "The Troubleshooter",
      "full_text": "The Troubleshooter is an American Western term. They used to have these characters that could take you across the country in carriages. The person who was sitting beside the driver was called the troubleshooter. If any trouble came along, this person would shoot it. This is where the word 'troubleshooter' comes from.\n\nLike all sixth lines, we have a transition field here. It goes beyond the nature of the hexagram and looks for much more. What the 39.6 is looking at is, \"Can we get this mutation into the world and, once it is in the world, will it be of value to humanity?' That is its process. You can see what the beauty of provocation is, at its highest level. Provocation, at its highest level, is nothing more than the capacity to go to somebody else and provide them, empower them, with mutation. \"I know what is wrong with your life.\" \"Get out of my face,\" is the answer of a lot of people who do not like anybody coming up to them to tell them what their problem is. \"Can I help you with this? Can I show you how to do this?\"\n\nNothing is more provocative in this life than somebody coming up to you and telling you what is wrong with you, and that they will fix it. Due to the nature of sixth lines, most of these troubleshooters never look for trouble and do not shoot. They just hope that the riot will be very quiet and everything will be okay. Their inherent gift is this capacity of penetrating to the core of what somebody's dilemma is. Not their own. Recognize how altruistic and special that is. Mutation is for the whole specie and never for the individuals. It is for the whole specie. Otherwise, it is of no value.\n\nSo, the ultimate field here is as it says in the white book: The energy to provoke others by attempting to solve their problems. The 39 is provoking to find the right spirit. So, anybody who is going to listen to these very gifted people is the right spirit. To be able to offer this mutation is a very gifted fuel: those people take the mutation and move it along.\n\nIn the black book it says: The natural gift for solving problems. It is a gift. What that ultimately means is that the final stage in our process, this mutation, will solve our problems. To get rid of these bodies is one way to solve our problems. It is just about changing the equipment. But nonetheless, you get to the point that you have problem-solving. What you will also have is when the 39 really has this capacity and when we get to the stage where the mutation takes place, it is a natural gift that will be accepted by others because they are a very important mutative force.\n\nMoon exalted. Practicality and the ability to guide and nurture others. These people get blown off so fast. In our work together, we are dealing with our adult consciousness, but you start your life with your design. If you have a 39.6 child and it says to you, \"I don't think that you know what you are doing in the kitchen,\" or \"You don't know how to run the computer,\" think about what happens to this 39.6 child. They have a natural gift for solving problems but it is provocative and they get rejected a lot for that provocation. That puts them in a bad mood because we are dealing with a mood gate and they feel terrible and then they say, \"I don't care. I won't help them or tell them what is wrong. They will give me a hard time. They will not do that.\" Always remember that when you are looking at any line, think about it first as a child's line before you think about it as an adult line."

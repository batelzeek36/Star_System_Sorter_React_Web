      "full_text": "The essence, the foundation of the hexagram. Moon exalted. The ability to accept and enjoy a subordinate position. If there is no attentiveness, there is no mutation. There is no awakening of the human spirit out of the 55, unless the 22 is willing to be the one that empowers the attentiveness. The stranger going out into the world without the attentiveness, the mutation cannot take place because there is nobody to listen. Mars in detriment. The inevitable humiliation that comes with claiming a first class seat with a second class ticket. I have met these people who have done exactly the same thing. They are always caught because that is not their job. The moment that they try to go ahead at the light instead of letting the other person come, they instantly have an accident.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The emotional awareness to enjoy a subordinate position; or Where the emotional energy challenges the awareness and can result in social humiliation. This is such a key for 22's. Without them, there is no public platform for mutation and yet their role is that, so often, they are not the ones that get any credit."

      "hd_title": "Charm school",
      "full_text": "The second lines rarely, if ever, deliver any kind of mutation. The nature of Charm school is that there is the ability to empower attentiveness through style. These people have a very powerful social mechanic: they have the capacity to get other people to be attentive but, at the moment that their turn comes, they do not have a lot to say. They have a social style but they do not necessarily have a mutation that they are being able to contribute. Remember that this is projection and not introspection.\n\nThe belief that style can mask nature. Sun exalted. The ability to successfully delude oneself and others. There is the sense of generating the attentiveness of others and, when their turn comes, they can be quite confused because there does not seem to be a great deal behind that mask. It is a social skill. These people are very good when that social skill is about their work. This is very handy to have on the material plane. They are very good at socializing at the stranger level, easily being able to make contact, but the moment that it gets more serious, the moment that it would involve a mutation, bringing something as a contribution, that is where the dilemma begins. Their value is that they can bring about the attentiveness so easily that they can create the social opportunities.\n\nJupiter in detriment. The legalization of form over substance. The charm school people with the detriment are the ones who know that it is all style. They can take advantage of that. The value of that is to be able to have a social situation in which you can offer something to get your individual process out.\n\nThe possibility to attract others with an emotional style; or Where the style is energized at the expense of awareness. The style becomes everything. These are people that can really get your attention. They are walking on the street and you see them and you say, \"Wow, that is really something.\" Then again, you may not be crazy about talking to them. That is another story."

      "hd_title": "The Enchanter",
      "full_text": "The 22.3 is one of those attributes that people write and sing about. It is an emotional type that, through the 12th gate, gets written about in love stories and poetry and songs. The third line is about adaptation and it is about bonds made and broken. It is about allegiance and rejection.\n\nThis line is called The Enchanter. This is the capacity of Perfected grace, or openness. That perfected openness is simply a genetic gift and it is not something that is anything other than self-involved. It is individual. That openness is there and it is perfect, but it does not stay. This is just something that keeps moving along. People are always confused by this because they think that that openness is something tribal. They think that it is an intimacy. It seems like an intimacy; it feels like an intimacy, but it is not. It is just this perfected openness, this perfected social grace.\n\nSaturn exalted. Form as a definition and actualization of substance. It is in the form: that is the Saturnian nature of it. It is really in the form. It is not something that is constructed. It is not something that is learned. It is right there, deep in the form itself, in every movement of that. These are people that, when you see them, you know that you have access to them, and that they will be open. That quality is there. It just won't stay there. You can't hold on to it.\n\nMars in detriment. Unconscious grace. In the Book of Letters, we have: The possibility for perfected openness through the alignment of emotional energy and awareness; and An innate openness, on the Martian side. It is simply just there. The thing to recognize about this is that they will never allow a romance to be consummated. This is the whole thing about the nature of this - they give you this sense that there is some place to go with them and there is not. They are there to empower you at the most attentive level. You are really there for them and then they are gone."

      "hd_title": "Sensitivity",
      "full_text": "When you get to the fourth line, you get to the line of externalization and you get to this fixedness, to this onepointedness, to the one-trackedness. We come to Sensitivity. Remember that the nature of the fourth line is that it is always ready to look to the other side; in this case, looking to the 12. Again, particularly in this case, this is one of the three social channels, so it is deeply social and deeply concerned about what is on the other side.\n\nThe modification of behavior to enrich interactions. The fixedness is: how do I modify my behavior? They are very concerned about their behavior, often at the expense of getting the mutation out. They are just concerned about what the behavior should be.\n\nNeptune exalted. Neptune in this position already tells you that it will be tough. A mediumistic simplicity that rejects elaborate rituals. This is one side of the behavioral process and the mediumistic quality, the mood quality. The whole thing about the mood process is that the moment that you recognize the nature of moods, you begin to recognize that you can identify moods of others through their tone. All of this is very acoustic. This mediumistic simplicity is simply to catch the vibration and know whether it is the right moment to create this individual process where you are going to try to bring about something that is new, where you try to bring out your mutation.\n\nMars in detriment. An over-reliance on the mechanics of style that can abort potentially significant relationships. They are so concerned about the behavior in the interaction, to be graceful, until finally waiting for your moment to release that mutation.\n\nIn the Book of Letters, the exalted: The possibility of social openness through the rejection of formality. Remember, this individual and its nature here is looking for the behavior that says, \"This is really me. I am individual. I don't have to do it the formal way.\"\n\nOn the other side: The limitation of social openness through the need for formality. The moment that you get into the formalities, you are limited in what kind of contact you are actually going to have.\n\nThis is the only moral dilemma of the individual. If you look throughout all the individuality, keynoted by the 23.3: amorality that lies within the individual process, this is the moral bone for the individual: \"If they are not paying attention to me, something is wrong.\" In the contact to the other, they have all their rights and wrongs. How do you deal with a stranger? How do you deal with the collective or the tribe? They have all their rights and wrongs. This is where their morality lies: how they are supposed to deal with the other. They get very fixed on that. The only way is to be informal; for example, executives that run around and tell everybody to strip off their ties."

      "hd_title": "Directness",
      "full_text": "The fifth line is a line of universalization, particularly in this case because this is a stream in which so much mutation takes place. The universalization that is possible through the fifth line here is very significant. This fifth line carries with it the mantra I give to everyone who is individual, particularly in this stream. \"Don't do anything unless you are in the mood.\" This is the great mood line and the moment that it is recognized for what it is, that is where its perfection lies.\n\nIt is called Directness. The disregard of form when required. 'Required' means if I am in the mood. If I am in the! mood,, it is okay. If not; it is not okay. Jupiter exalted. The power inherent in higher principals to successfully transgress behavioral codes., If I am not in the mood, I will not do it.\n\nThis one of my favorite stories: Jurgen and I, this year in the spring, were both very illl amd had traveled from Amsterdam vial southern Germamy to Vienna to a very cold, wet place near the Hungarian border. VVred arrived a day late and there were people silting in the mill, waiting for us to- arrive. We finally get there. We have lunch and afterwards, we want to start the course. I can feel everybody's energy: they are waiting and I start setting everything up, when Jurgen walks iin and says, \"I am not in the mood, so I cant do it.\" I know his design. He is a 12.5/22.5 which means that when he! is not in the mood, he. can't do, it. It takes a lot of courage to say that. Ji rgen stayed in bed and Henrietta did the whole course and everything was fine. People are always afraid to honor their true nature.. If you do not do so, you can mever (live with yourself and you bring alll kinds of problems into other people's lives.\n\nThe integrity of this line is living by the nature of its moods. Only in honoring its moods does it honor the deep potential that lies in that: to be graceful. Otherwise, they really are disgraceful. They disgrace themselves and can create very embarrassing situations, such as Mars in detriment: A tendency to create embarrassing situations, and though invariably successful, the often resulting reputation for crudity and impudence.\n\nIn the white book: The possibility through emotional awareness to behave individualistically in social interaction. To behave individualistically is to honor your moods.\n\nThe possibility that individual behavior in social interaction will generate negative projections from others. So often I get invited some place and, the moment I am there, my mood says, \"Go.\" So I walk out. If I don't live with myself, I have a problem. I follow the nature of what my moods tell me. I have the 12th gate. If I step into an emotional field that I don't like, I immediately know to leave. When I walk out, I know what they say behind me. I have been called everything."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Maturity",
      "full_text": "One of the great jokes about this is that the next line is the 36.1. We go back to the deep need for an experience; in other words, not to have a second class ticket, to go beyond that to actually experience something different. This line is called Maturity. The alignment with experience of form with substance.\n\nSun exalted. Natural and evident leadership and authority. It is through this sixth line that we will live out a new social mutation. Think about that. Spirit awareness is something that will be the most social thing. We can't even imagine now how social that is. This is an entirely new social horizon that will come into view for us. The leadership for that lies with the 22 because it is about attentiveness, paying attention to the other in a very deep way. Paying attention to the spirit of the other, ultimately, is its possibility and the leadership comes out of that.\n\nMars in detriment. The alignment tends to express itself in nonconformist modes. Something very different can come out of this line, something very new. The 12.6 is called Metamorphosis. Only two gates in the whole wheel have such a name; the other gate is the 62.5. In the stream from the 39.6 to the 12.6, there is a deep metamorphic process.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The possibility that experience in social interaction will result in a leadership capacity. These people really know the social environment, but again, their concern is far beyond that. Their concern is the establishment of mutation that they would love to see experienced (their movement to the 36): will this mutation bring crisis? What kind of change will it bring? It tries to see what it is going to be like. Remember that the individual brings mutation, but only the collective judges it. The individual does not. In this context, it is looking for that experience to see what it will be like. Not an experiment; it is not something logical that is about to happen.\n\nPlease take this as a deeply mystical clue. Spirit awareness is not logical any more than emotions are logical. We can describe it logically through Human Design, but we are describing the mechanic and not the emotion. The spirit is not something that will be logical. That is one of the keys to recognize.\n\nThe possibility that experience in social interaction will result in a non-conformist expression of openness. This non-conformist expression of openness is a window to the possibilities of the emotional spirit. Now, these people can be easily depressed by not being able to see the mutation and the nature of it alive."

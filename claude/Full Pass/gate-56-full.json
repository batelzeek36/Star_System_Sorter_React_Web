      "full_text": "This first line is called Quality. We know that all first lines are introspective by their very nature. Here, you get the essence of what stimulation is all about.\n\nMoon exalted. The practical sense that even short term activities should be of value. What that is really saying is here in the white book: Expression of practical ideas that have value. This is all about using this capacity to stimulate others with ideas that are of value, reflections that are of value and not just any old thing. The 56 just wants to stimulate. After all, it is not aware. It is a throat mechanic. What it needs to do is to constantly stimulate. But the reality is that the feedback is necessary. You need those who are really interested in that, who will believe in that, who will be stimulated by that. So, the importance is that whatever you are stimulating with should have value itself. The other thing is that when you are working with an idea, when you are overtaken by an idea, you have to go through the whole idea before you can jump and go to the next one. That is the other side of the coin.\n\nMars in detriment. Whenever you see Mars, you know that you have a certain level of immaturity that exists. So on the other side of this line, there is a lot of immaturity built into that process of stimulation. \"Let me stimulate you. Don't you believe me? This is me.\" There is the need to have the collective accept that process, and the Mars is: The ego drive to make an impression that will misuse energy in trivial pursuits. This is somebody who does not care what the quality of the concept is. They are only interested in getting out their stimulation and they try to stimulate people with anything, just to be able to get this feedback.\n\nIn the white book: The drive to stimulate that will express any idea, no matter how trivial. Understand that this is the basis of what stimulation is all about. On one side, there is this clear recognition that the only things worth stimulating others with are things of value. There is no point telling somebody about this great idea of thermo-nuclear physics if it does not mean anything to them. It has to be of value to them; otherwise, you are not successfully going to stimulate them.\n\nBut the tendency in this gate is simply to want to stimulate for the sake of stimulating. This is always going to run into difficulties because first lines do not know anything about the other side. The 56 wants to be able to stimulate but it does not really understand the idea in the first place. It just wants to be able to stimulate. This is why 56's become the great believers and disbelievers. They go through this whole process of belief and disbelief. The moment that they are trying to get people to believe in their stimulation, they discover that they themselves do not believe in it. The moment that you get into the trivial side of stimulation, you are always running into backlash from people because they are not going to believe you."

      "full_text": "The 56th hexagram contains two lines that use the word 'genius.' Genius is mentioned six times out of 384 lines, so there is a great potential for the very unusual. Both of these lines, the second and the fifth, are in resonance to each other and they are both exalted by Uranus. There is an extraordinary quality of unusualness that can exist in this stimulation and it can be of enormous value at a deep intellectual level.\n\nWhenever we are dealing with a second line, always remember that these first three lines are not well equipped to deal with the other side. The other side in this case is the idea itself.\n\nWhen you are dealing with the second line, you are always dealing with projection. Every second line that you have is projecting the quality of that hexagram out into the world, but you do not necessarily have the depth. First lines are always busy finding their foundation, but second lines are just projecting it out with no way of looking inside.\n\nThink about what that is like for somebody who is a stimulator. If you have the 56.2, you are always projecting out that you can stimulate others. So they come into your aura waiting to be stimulated and either you can or you can't. You don't really know. You are just projecting out this field in you to others that you are the one that can stimulate them. Maybe you can; maybe you can't.\n\nLinkage. Uranus exalted. Isolated genius that will eventually find continuity through recognition and support. It is isolated because this is a genius for stimulation in which the awareness or depth is unknown. Here is somebody that has a gift within them, potentially, to be very stimulating for others, but they do not really know that they have that gift. And it may not happen now and not tomorrow, it may show up sometime, somewhere down the track. It can happen three days before you die, when you are 92; or it can happen right away.\n\nIt also means that it is something that will occur. The person that has the second line, that is projecting outwards, they really need somebody to come into their aura, recognize their gift and say, \"Wow. You can really stimulate others,\" and the second line will say, \"Really? Do you think so?\" Because they do not know that they have that depth.\n\nIn the white book: A genius for stimulating expression that will take time to mature and will need others to recognize it. What that means is if you have a child that has the 56.2, you need to recognize that you need to encourage them to see that they have this power to stimulate. Otherwise, they get found out at an early age and they can forever hold back that gift within them. Anytime that you see a second line in somebody's chart, you know that is a place where you can go to them and provide them with what they need, that is, the recognition that what they are projecting out is also real underneath. These people do not know that. They recognize their own projection going out but they do not really know, and underneath that can lie a great deal of insecurity.\n\nThe Moon in detriment. Asuperficiality... (Again, this is a projected field. There is no genuine depth in that.) ...which collapses under recognition and is eventually forced to move on. The inability to know whether you can really stimulate others or not always puts that person in that position of having that test. Somebody comes and says, \"Okay, stimulate me. Go ahead. I dare you.\" If you can't, of course, there is the collapse.\n\nA gift for communicating, but not enough depth. So the 56.2's have to recognize that it will take them time to be able to really be secure in their communicating gift. The best for them, by the way, is the resonance of the 1 1 .2 or 1 1 .5 in people or transits that they meet."

      "hd_title": "Alienation",
      "full_text": "When you get to the third line, to the completion of the lower trigram, you are dealing with the concept or terminology of adaptation. Everything about the nature of the third line is about the recognition that it involves a process that we call trial and error. This is a wave of bonds made or broken, and this is the learning process in life. Nothing distinguishes the third line more than this process of: you can't do it. It does not work. You try it again in another way. It does not work. You go through this process of trial and error.\n\nHere the trial and error is called Alienation. It says: Determined self-sufficiency. Understand something. It is very difficult for somebody with the 56th gate to be self-sufficient. They are dependent on the ideas and the concepts coming from the 11th gate and they are forced to adapt. Yet, at the same time, the 56th gate, because it is a metamorphic gate in the throat, needs to be the one that does the expressing. The self-sufficiency in the third line is, \"I want to be the one that does the speaking.\" This is the need to be the stimulator. There still is not a clear understanding that there is something on the other side of the channel that they are going to have to make a deal with, that they are going to have to work out an arrangement with.\n\nMy constant warning to you: Do not get caught up in making a moralistic judgment about whether this line is good or bad. It is not about that. It is a process. The third line has a resonance in the sixth line, which has a potential for wisdom. Wisdom can only come about through trial and error as a process in life. If you never make mistakes in this life, you can never be wise. That is a basic formula.\n\nThis third line, though it may alienate a lot of people, the person that is doing all the alienating may eventually get to a point of real wisdom about what to stimulate and what not to stimulate with. They finally learn how to adapt to others. The first three lines are always at this disadvantage that they are not transpersonal. They do not really understand what is on the other side. They have to go through their own process and in that they can always be alienating.\n\nPeople who have the first line, you do not really know whether they are there or not. They are not showing you anything out of that first line. You have to go digging for that. They are into their own process. The second line is pushing all this out but you do not know what is underneath and they are not capable of that. The third line is ready to adapt but it does not know what to adapt to because it does not know where it is going to come from. They are involved in their own processes.\n\nThe drive to control the expression at the expense of stimulation. \"Don't interfere with me. I will not tell you anything unless you are quiet.\" A friend of mine, many years ago, was a teacher and he had the 56.3. He was the kind of person who will stand in front of a class and say, \"If you are not quiet, I will not teach you.\" This is the 56.3. You have to control everything first and some people do not want to be controlled. \"I will not be quiet. I am not interested in what you have to say. You are not very interesting.\" And all of a sudden, that person has to adapt and they do not want to adapt. They want to be in control and start screaming, \"Shut up. I am talking.\" It can be quite a process until they learn.\"\n\nEvery time that you see the collective channels being completely defined in the mind, you know that these people are close to being impossible in terms of trying to get through their fixedness. That is their gift after all: they are here to have both ends fixed and they have a very specialized process but, because of that, it is very hard to get in. It takes time. It will be a longer process for them to be able to go through an adaptation. If you have the 56.3 connected to the 11, it is difficult for you to learn to adapt because you are so fixed on your own ideas that you are not open to the possibility of adaptation."

      "hd_title": "Expediency",
      "full_text": "Now, we come to the fourth line in the upper trigram. The 1 1 .4 is called The Teacher and it is an exalted line. Our evolutionary process was changed by a mutation that took place in the axis of the 11.4 and the 12.4. The 12.4 is The Prophet, the arousing of the stagnant. It opened up the communicating capability in our throat. The opposition to that is the 1 1 A, The Teacher.\n\nThis line is broken up into three possibilities: the teacher, the guru and the sage: all of the possibilities for being able to communicate philosophical and conceptual ideas. Here, when you are looking at the fourth line, you are looking at the direct resonance to this very important line of being able to teach. In the fourth line, we are dealing with a process of externalization. This is the beginning of a process that is transpersonal. The fourth line realizes that there is an idea on the other end and, in order for the 56.4 to be a good stimulator, they have to be able to handle the idea at the other end and externalize it. This externalization is about being focused and being very clear that this is the thing that you have to push across. They can be really one -tracked in their process.\n\nThe other thing to recognize about all fourth lines is that they are rooted in the concept of opportunism. All fourth lines only get to externalize at the right moment and if they try to externalize with the wrong timing, it does not really work very well for them because they are very fixed.\n\nThis fourth line is called Expediency. The perfection of the superficial personality that can mask, when essential, its true feelings to secure protection. Imagine that the 56 is a microphone and the 1 1 with the ideas is the voice. The microphone is not interested in taking on the persona of the 1 1 . It is a mask. It is simply going to release the information. It is very important to understand that in this fourth line is the ultimate storyteller who tells stories as a role. It is superficial. This is somebody that is just a good storyteller and in that role of being a storyteller, they can stimulate you and get the idea across.\n\nIf I were to do the chart of Jesus, if that was possible, I am sure that I would find the 56.4 because this is the line of telling parables, of telling stories to get your message across. It is not that you believe in your own story. Please understand that. There is an old joke about a family sitting together and the father is telling a story, and the child finally interrupts and it says, \"Papa, is this true?\" and this mother slaps him on the back of his head and says, \"Don't interrupt your father. He is telling a story.\"\n\nThat is not true. The gift of being able to stimulate, to tell stories and the value of the 56 is about sharing what it is to be human with others. Our whole mental process is so that we can come to grips with what it is to be a human being and live in this world. It is not about dictating what we do. Every time I do somebody's reading, I am always telling people the same thing. The mind can't tell you what to do. It does not matter whether it is defined or undefined, connected to the throat or not. It does not make any damn difference. It is not going to be able to tell you what to do and it is never going to work for you. The mind does not do that. That is not its job. Its job is not to tell us what to do but to examine the nature of our doing, to look at our process.\n\nThis stimulation is not about getting people to do something. It is there to share in the awareness of what it is to be human. That is what it is about. Because we live on the mental plane and all of you have been deeply conditioned to think that what you think is what you should do, or what you would like to think is what you would like to do and all of the things that go with it, we end up in this horrible place in which human beings don't live out what they do, and they take these ideas seriously as a game plan for life. \"I have this wonderful idea. Why don't we all jump off this side of the bridge and see how many of us survive?\" Well, very nice. An idea is not necessarily something that requires any kind of doing. Ideas are about stimulating each other about the nature of what it is to be here in the world."

      "hd_title": "Attraction",
      "full_text": "When you get to the fifth line, you get to universalization. The way the world sees this gate of stimulation is that they see it as something that attracts attention, and that's what it does. This is the line of Attracting attention. Here, again we have the resonance to the second line. In the second line we see that all second line people are projecting out without necessarily knowing the depth underneath, and all fifth line people are being projected on. If you are a 56.5, every time that somebody comes into your aura, their projection is that you are a storyteller. That may or may not be true, but that is their projection on you. Their projection is that you are the stimulator, you are the storyteller.\n\nYou know what this is like. You have a dinner party and you want to make sure that somebody is there who keeps everybody talking. You will always pick a fifth line because they are the ones you project on. \"This one is okay. This one is very stimulating.\" It is a projection but that does not mean that underneath that projection is no power. If you have a fifth line, wherever it is, the outside world will project onto that.\n\nThat means something very special. What that means is that the outside will give you an opportunity to tell your story and if you are a lousy storyteller, too bad. But the outside world will give you that opportunity because they will project on you that you are the stimulator and that you have a story to tell them.\n\nUranus exalted. Unusualness, innovation and sometimes genius as guarantees of eventually attracting attention and support. The opportunity is always there. Genetically, it is built in. This is, after all, a stimulating, storytelling gate. The capacity is there. It just may not be the right stimulation, but nonetheless, everybody is going to come and project on that. In the white book: Stimulation at its most innovative and unusual.\n\nMars in detriment: All too often a tendency to attract attention that is self-defeating in its effects. What happens so often, when you go through the lines and these kinds of statements, is that we take them into our minds in the context of our lives at the present time. But please understand that this is a process of coming into the world, being born with this kind of a line and going through the development of your infancy, your childhood, your whole aging process. It can be very difficult when you are a child because everybody projects on you. This is the kind of child (with the 56.5) that comes into the classroom late and starts to give an excuse of why they are late, and the teacher is not going to believe it. The teacher will project onto this child: this child is a storyteller and it may or may not tell me the truth. You have to have a really good story. So, this projection gives you an opportunity but at the same time, it can pull the rug out from underneath your feet. That is the other side to see about it.\n\nEvery time that you have a fifth line, you have to recognize that the more you mature into the nature of that hexagram (it takes time, all these processes take time), you get to a point where, at that moment of projection on you, you are genuinely ready to respond. There is a gift that lies in here but there is always that pressure of projection. This is a line where it is very difficult for people who are intrinsic liars. The moment you have an intrinsic genetic liar, and we have gates that bring out this quality, then you have somebody that will be projected on all of their life that they are just simply a storyteller and they are not to be believed. After all, nothing the 5 wants more than to be believed. \"Do you believe me? Please, believe in me.\" They want you to believe in them and everybody who comes to these people wants to believe in them. \"I want to believe that you are telling me the truth but my projection says that you are lying.\" This is part of the process that the 5 has to deal with.\n\nThe power of stimulation to provoke and disturb. The moment that you have a projected force on you, people come with their projection, which means that they do not see you; so, depending on what you bring back to them, they can be made quite uncomfortable in that process. Everything about what we consider stimulation is hooked into this. We have the tradition throughout our history of the traveling storyteller. Now, we live in the world of online and internet storytelling, of television and film, which is all part of this archetype of attracting attention."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Caution",
      "full_text": "When you get to the sixth line, you get to the end of a process. This sixth line, like all sixth lines, does not really have anything to do with the hexagram itself. It is already beyond that process. It is like the roof of a house. You are looking out over the top and you do not get to see anymore what is inside because you have been through that process and you are looking out for what is beyond all that. When you are dealing with a gate of stimulation and you come to the sixth line, that is somebody who may stimulate you or not.\n\nThe frequency wave of all sixth lines is a wave that we call trust or not. It is about trust. Every sixth line is no longer simply interested in what is the harmonic gate at the other end of the channel but all sixth lines are looking at the entire process. They are looking towards the whole circuit. They are not just interested in an idea, they want to know where the ideas will go, what it will cost in terms of time, energy and spirit. What kind of change and crisis will it bring? Will it bring success of not? Can it have a beginning, a middle and an end? Is it really worthwhile doing it? The sixth line is caught up in trying to see: is it really worth it? Why should I bother to stimulate anyone if that stimulation is not going to get to this and that?\n\nWhen you come to the abstract process, you come to a process rooted in expectation. Every time you look at somebody's chart and you see a gate that is part of the abstract circuit, you know right away that in that gate, you have all this expectation. It is the expectation that if I do this, I am going to get that. This expectation can be a very painful process because there is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever, that if you do step 1, 2, 3 and 4, they will give you your reward. The 56.6 says, \"I know. I really do. If I stimulate, I do expect to have this and that and, quite frankly, from my experience, I don't see that because every time I stimulate it goes like this or that, but it does not really bring all of that.\" So when you get to the sixth line, it is not like you are saying, \"Aha, here is somebody that is going to stimulate us.\" Maybe they never say a word to you. Instead of this being someone that can express, \"I believe\", they may believe in nothing at all because they are looking for something else. They are looking for more than just simply another idea. What is built into this is the fact that this line, more than any other line, is open to every single kind of idea that you can imagine. Everything. Open to the whole field of possible stimulation and due to that, they may stimulate nothing at all.\n\nCaution. The prudence, when linkage has been achieved, to honor its new commitments in order to secure its footing. Literally, what that says is that the moment you connect to an idea, if you are really going to stimulate with that, you have to stay with the whole process. You have to go through the whole thing. You have to see how the whole thing works out.\n\nHonesty in expression. Living by one's word. It is very difficult to be an abstract person and to live by your word. This is somebody that wants to be able to know that what they are telling other people to believe in, they believe in themselves. If you go to the 10.6, you see that in all sixth lines the hidden behavior is always about the question, \"Are we hypocrites, or not? How can we be a role model if we are hypocritical in that role?\" This sixth line here is dealing with the same process. \"I am not just going to stimulate somebody because I can. I will stimulate them with something that is true to my own spirit, so that I am not a hypocrite.\" Very hard to do because ideas are unstable by their very nature. It is not easy to find an idea that you can live with. You look in your lives and see how many ideas have survived that you have carried inside of you. They come and they go. The 56.6 knows this.\n\nAt the other end of this, you have Pluto in detriment. A very powerful Pluto transit and we have all kinds of people from 1939 to 1941 that carry this Pluto in 56. The profound unconscious wanderer, where external yearning for acceptance will unconsciously release the exact energy that creates rejection. A difficult role, where the self is unknown and not recognized with predictable results. In the white book: Wandering throughout the life from one expression to the next, unable to find the stimulation that one could live by.\n\nEvery single person that carries this energy, they will travel their whole life through every kind of possible idea. They will go through everything to try to find the one idea that they can really live with. Until then, other than when they are young, they will stop stimulating other people with these ideas. When they get to a point where they recognize that no idea is good enough for them, they become anti-stimulating. Somebody comes up to them and says, \"I have this great idea,\" and the 56.6 answers, \"I have heard it. I am not interested. I know that stuff. I know that philosophy. I know that school of thought. I know those ideas. I know that way. It is not something that I can live with.\""

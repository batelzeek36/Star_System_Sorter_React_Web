      "full_text": "The first line is the foundation and it always gives you the essential truth of a hexagram. Here, the first line is called Interdependence.\n\nThe Sun exalted. The successful approach that does not lose its individual character in acceptance. At the other end of the channel, you have the 49, the gate of Revolution, of principles and of rejection. It is an emotional gate. When resources seem to be available one moment, they may not be there the next moment.\n\nIn the white book: The pressure of wanting without losing one's identity when being accepted by others. Others are always involved here because this is all about support. But the reality is that simply because one needs to have resources does not mean that one gives up one's nature in order to get those resources. This is very important. In other words, the tribe is not meant to be homogeneous. The tribe allows for individuality, for difference, as long as everybody is contributing to the resources, which can then be available for all.\n\nWhen you get to the other side of this energy, we have the Moon in detriment. The tendency, once an approach is accepted, to get stuck in continued reflection at the expense of continued development. It is not just about wanting to be needed. It is not just about resource of food, spirit, religion. It is also the resource of having a partner. Remember that this is the channel of the bride and groom. This is all about creating the initial bargain that creates the foundation of how any kind of tribal relationship is going to work.\n\nIn the white book it says: The pressure for acceptance which fears eventual rejection. The 19th gate flirts because it is looking for the possible resources at the other end. The moment that those resources are offered, it may not be the real thing. It may be momentary. The resources may be there and, later, they are not because the 49th gate is moving in a wave.\n\nThe recognition about the first line is that, yes, there is interdependence, but there is no dependency. If you go into any man/woman relationship anywhere on this planet, you will come to this place: are we interdependent, or is one of us dependent on the other? This does more damage to relationships than anything else. It is fundamental in establishing the nature of the tribe. Are we interdependent? Are we allowed to be our own selves within our support for each other or is that support based on one being dependent on the other, as we well know? The vast majority of relationships have been based on dependency instead of interdependency.\n\nHere you have the fundamental theme for marriage, for the bonding of people in a life work together. This is the fundamental dilemma. Is it going to be interdependent, or is it a dependency? You can see very clearly that, the moment there is dependency, there is a loss of identity. In the moment of dependency, one has to go against one's own principles because one is dependent. Thus, they no longer have the power that exists in interdependency."

      "hd_title": "Service",
      "full_text": "The second line is all about projection. You can see that this second line is the one that has a highly valued title. It is called Service. If you wonder how they chose the priestesses for temples, the little boys and girls that were the reincarnated Lama: these are the children that were usually pulled out. These are the ones that get automatically recognized by those who are sensitive as being ready to serve at some level, if you go down a \"road lined with begging kids, it will be the child that has the 19.2 that you address with, \"You come. I'll feed you and you'll do some things for me.\" That is the one that is projecting out, whether it is true or not, that they will be of service in return. Never forget the bargain. They are of service in return for the resources. The resources have to be there but they are ready and willing to serve. The dedication of personal resources as a result of external contact. Personal resources are: \"You use your body and I will feed you. You will work in my fields.\"\n\nJupiter exalted. Dedication and service to the highest values. Mercury in detriment. Protracted indecision, but given the nature of this position, eventual compliance. First we have the resistance to being of service, to being a servant in order to get access to the resources. In our age, we do not have this so much, but in the past, there were always indentured people, people who worked for other people, who were not given salary but food, and lived as part of that community in return for their labors. This form of service is very ancient. It is indentured labor in that sense. It can also be at the highest level.\n\nThe energy to want to be of service. That is projected out. That is why these people are chosen when they are very young, so that they can be conditioned to that for the rest of their lives. They project out, \"I will be of service.\" Thus, they end up being of service. They end up being servants. They end up being of service, but not necessarily for the highest values.\n\nOn the Mercurial side we have, The need to be wanted that will eventually turn its energy to service. In other words, the only way for these people, no matter how much they resist, is that they finally have to be of service in order to get the resources. Otherwise, they do not get in on the bargain and they are left out of the tribe. If you are left out, you have no life anymore. This was the tribe's greatest weapon. There is nowhere you can go if the tribe leaves you out: this 49 who says, \"This one? No. Send them away.\"\n\nWe are dealing with a Mystical channel here, so we can never discount the fact that what is of mundane service (\"I will be of service if you will really reward me; I will give you the best service, if you can give me the best reward.\") can also be spiritual. It can also be the priestess that says, \"I will serve my goddess but I really want to be rewarded for that.\" The reward, in the spiritual sense, is that they will touch me, that they will contact me, that they will fill me with their power. That is also part of it.\n\nThis is the beginning of our whole religious experience, which is also in this service. Somebody who naturally was projected on that they would be of service, \"Okay, you service this temple to this goddess,\" will spend their life at it. They develop this higher principle service. It is built into these people that they are the ones that are selected in life to be of service.\n\nIt can be quite frustrating. If somebody comes and projects on them, \"You can be of service,\" afterwards, it turns out that they are not really. They are just pulled into that situation. If they do not really work because they may not be right for that kind of service, then it falls apart. Then they have great difficulties. Indentured labor is not slavery. There are always possibilities that at some point they can buy themselves out, though it is a very difficult process.\n\nThis is where tribal prostitution is. Tribal prostitution is different from collective prostitution. Temple prostitution or prostituting oneself for the benefit of the tribe. The nature of this is being brought into service and made dependent. You can end up having to do things for the benefit of the tribe to get your resources. That is not a comfortable thing to be involved in."

      "hd_title": "Dedication",
      "full_text": "We come to the theme of trial and error and bonds made and broken. Here we are dealing with this theme within the context of support and the need for resources. This line is called Dedication. It is about being dedicated to needing those resources. No matter where you go with a 19, you are not going to escape this deep need for the resources, whatever the resources happen to be.\n\nReceptivity to approach can only be maintained through vigilance, being on guard. It is one of the things to understand about the nature of being dedicated, that it is not simply a matter to need to have the resources but, in order to get them, you have to stay with it. You have to be vigilant. You have to guard and protect it. If you figure out how to condition animals (that is part of this stream), how to get sheep to live in your backyard, it is not enough that you have them there and you know that you can eat them. You have to guard against them being taken away as well. In other words, you have to remain vigilant. This is not a one shot abstract experience where you grab the money and run. It means that you are stuck, that you are hooked up. It means that you are locked into a tribal obligation. Thus, vigilance is necessary. Otherwise, the resources can never be maintained or held on to.\n\nVenus exalted. The natural ease with which communion is maintained. Think about this: the natural ease with which communion is maintained, but not the resources. These people are so dedicated to needing the resources that they have no problem with other people in the tribe. It is surprisingly easy for them to make the relationships, but they do not really work out. They are a third line and make mistakes because it is not about the relationship. It is about whether or not the relationship can manifest, can bring about the resources. It does not matter who your associates are, but if you want to feed yourself and you want to live, you will have to have associates that will bring you to that. It requires vigilance, not simply just skills of being ready to support others or be supported.\n\nMoon in detriment. A tendency to moodiness... In this sense, it is all about sensitivity, the emotional field of this stream. ...that may lead to carelessness.\n\nIn the white book: Sensitivity and ease fueled by acceptance by others. It is all very easy if somebody accepts me. I can be there with them, but the resources, that is where the vigilance is. It is not about how many friends you have. It is about how productive your relationships are in that sense. It is not about how many people are in the tribe. If 99 % of them are on the dole, the tribe is starving. It is not just about having the numbers in terms of people. This is the trial and error.\n\nThe other side is, The need to be wanted hampered by oversensitivity. This oversensitivity is an enormous theme in this stream. It always has to do with resources. These people only become oversensitive when there are not enough resources for them. This is the other side of this line. It does not matter how many people are around. One becomes very sensitive, oversensitive as a potential, when the resources are not adequate for the need being offered. \"Here I am. I am offering my support. Where are the resources? I give my support to you and you all have access to it.\" Then they get oversensitive: \"What about me? You left me out? Am I in this bargain? Don't I get my cut?\" This is the third line. It has to learn that it is not about numbers.\n\nThe tribe is always stuck in numbers, this mundane aspect of being able to make more money for your work. It is not about how many people are there. It is the value inherent in the relationship. Is everybody in the tribe productive? Is the tribe truly interdependent or do we have a tribe that is based on dependency? Two people work and one person takes a ride. What kind of a tribe is that? The third line is saying, \"Heyl You have to learn to see that not everybody is going to pull their weight.\" That is why there is so much flirting in the 19, trying to see who really does pull their weight, who really can carry through the vigilance and bring it to fulfillment."

      "hd_title": "The Team Player",
      "full_text": "When you come to the fourth line in the upper trigram, you really get to clearly see the resonance from the first line. The first line was about interdependency, or dependency. When you come to the resonance in the fourth line, you come to the power of single-mindedness, this fixed externalization in the fourth line. It is about The Team Player. Individual approach which attracts and accepts cooperation.\n\nMars exalted and at its best; there is no other place in the Rave I'Ching that has such a comment on a planet. The power and energy for outward activity, and the ability to accept others as long as they can keep up. A driving force that can benefit the whole group. In the white book: The energy to seek out and exalt in the company of others. These are driving forces. \"Where will we get those resources$ Come on. Let's do it.\" They are the ones that can bring this enormous energy to work as an interdependent energy. They bring their own, as long as everybody can keep up.\n\nWhen you come to the other side, you get to see what happens because it is Venus in detriment. Attractive and cooperative, but a tendency to dissatisfaction with the contribution of others. \"They are dependent on me.\" Not the first line that says, \"I am dependent on them.\" This is the other way around. \"They are dependent on me and I don't want them to be dependent on me.\" That is when they become sensitive.\n\nA sensitivity energized by the limitation of others. \"Why should I do all the work? I don't mind working and doing my share, but are you doing yours?\" These people are very fixed. If you go to school with this kind of person and you get a summer job with them, the last thing you want to do is to work with them. They work hard all the time. They put in eight hours of hard work and the other person is wondering whether they are all right. \"Don't work so fast. I want to have a cigarette. I want to have a rest to meditate.\" So, what happens is that they feel like everybody is being dependent on them and they have to carry everybody's weight."

      "hd_title": "Sacrifice",
      "full_text": "The fifth line, the line of universalization, is how everybody else sees the hexagram, or how they project onto the hexagram. This is the line of the dead. Think about what that is like: You are a commander in the fields and you have to take some hill away from the enemy. There are only two members of your troop that are going to stand out to you automatically: the 19.2 and the 19.5. The 19.2 will be of service because they are projecting out, \"I will go and do it.\" But you also know about the 19.2 that there is a limit to what they will do because they are expecting a resource in return. Therefore, they will do only so much and go no further. The 19.5 is a bargain for a commander because a 19.5 is quite ready not only to be of service, but to sacrifice themselves in that service. And in the larger context of the movie, they do not get any resources for it other than a medal that is placed on their grave. In other words, they are quite willing to sacrifice themselves without any need for resource in return, and remember, that is not their true nature. That is what is projected on them.\n\nThe projected field wants to see the 19th hexagram, this need, as a readiness to sacrifice. \"Why should I pay you? Do it for the benefit of the tribe. Why do you need resources? Make a sacrifice. Take a day off a week and work for the state for nothing.\" You have countries in our century that have done that. Everyone has to take a day off. At least it is not three days a week to build the pyramids but nonetheless, the sacrifice is inherent here. When you see somebody with a 19.5, there is a Christ complex at work in there. This sacrifice for the higher good is projected on them. \"This one will make the sacrifice. This one will bleed for the cause. This one will die.\" This is projected on them. Given the right principle, they will.\n\nThe need to limit personal potential in order to achieve a larger goal. \"I will die so that others may live. I'll die on this cross, so all of you can be redeemed for your sins.\" This is the basic theme. It goes back to the sacrifice of children. When they were going to sacrifice children for the fertility festival in the springtime, the 19.5's were sacrificed, and all spotted by the 49.5. I am a 49.5. I know them when I see them. \"This one over there can be sacrificed,\" and the 19.5 will come forward and say \"yes.\"\n\nThe Mayan culture had ritual sacrifices. Most of the time, those sacrificed were criminals and border tribes but they had certain numbers to be sacrificed because mathematics was very important. There were times when there were not enough numbers to fill the list of those that had to be sacrificed, and there were people who would come forward and agree to be sacrificed. \"I have to make a sacrifice for the greater good because, if I don't die, the tribe will have a problem and the magic of the tribe will die.\"\n\nThe Earth exalted. The self-restraint fundamental to such a nature. If you will sacrifice, you have to be very clear about what kind of sacrifice you want to make. Fifth lines have great opportunities in life because they are projected on. They are recognized for an inherent trait within them. In this case, these people can make enormous sacrifices for the societies around them and get almost no return on that. They are part of what keeps the tribe alive and, in our time, this energy is very important. We expect sacrifice. Think about how millions and millions of people in this century walked off and sacrificed their lives in wars. \"I will fight communism. I will sacrifice my life.\"\n\nJupiter in detriment. A tendency in sacrifice to condescend. \"I have to do it for them because they cannot do it themselves. After all, they can never hang on the cross long enough.\"\n\nSacrifice can fuel a lack of sensitivity. Those who are constantly asked to sacrifice, because that is the projection, become desensitized after a while due to the role that they have to play. One of the most important things for anybody who carries the energy of the 19.5 is to recognize that this sacrifice is always going to be essential but only for the correct principle. This is a dilemma because the principle is an emotional principle that moves in a wave. This is not an easy thing. We are ready to sacrifice one moment to spare ourselves from Catholics, or the Nazis, and the next moment, they are suddenly acceptable. One has to be careful about the principles one is ready to sacrifice for. That is a key here.\n\nThere is no choice. You can only care in the sense of being aware of what it is. All mammals have the 19th gate. They will make those sacrifices and die. They do that quite regularly; it is built in. It is built into us, too. We exalt it and take it to another level because we take it to a higher principle. We bring in the emotional field and the potential for Spirit.\n\nThere will be a time in which this sacrifice will be very different, like all things. The moment that the nature of the emotional system changes, we will change the nature of sacrifice because who decides about who gets sacrificed or not is the 49th gate which operates in an emotional wave and is not aware. Therefore, those sacrifices are unusually cruel and meaningless. Stalin says, \"Kill all the Gulags.\" So you go into the Ukraine and kill millions of people and you take all of the crop for four years in a row and sell it on the foreign market. Thus, they starve to death. For what? This is when the principles of the 49 go haywire because they are being ruled by an emotional wave and there is no awareness and no spirit consciousness.\n\nSacrifice in our times is still something that can be very sad. It can also be beautiful because we glorify it. Our tribes are built on our martyrs. Wherever you go, there is somebody who has done something for the state, the last offender of the wall. We consider these people heroes at the highest level because they were ready to sacrifice for the benefit of others. That is what we expect from them. What they are is either interdependent, or dependent."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "The Recluse",
      "full_text": "One of the extraordinary incarnation crosses in the wheel is called the Cross of the Four Ways. The Cross of the Four Ways is comprised of the four hexagrams that are especially about a way, and they form a perfect cross in the zodiac. The 19th hexagram, Approach, is directly opposite the 33rd hexagram, which is called Retreat and, exactly at a quarter angle from that, you get the 24th hexagram in Taurus, which is the gate of Return. Exactly opposite that, you have the 44th hexagram, Coming to Meet. These are the four ways of the world: Approach, Retreat, Coming to Meet and Return. So when you are dealing with the 19th gate, you are dealing with something very deep inside of you because it is one of the ways. This way is a deep recognition for the need for resources and there are all kinds of resources.\n\nWhen we get to the sixth line, we get to the transition. We know that all our religious experience begins in the 19th gate. It is the gate of animism and animal sacrifice. It is the gate of child sacrifice. It is where ideals are built. This is the whole beginning of that process and its culmination is The Recluse.\n\nThis sixth line of the Recluse is trying to see the whole process. It does not want to engage unless it has that kind of assurance that the whole process is possible. The whole process of the tribe is that the resources have to be enough to allow the tribe to flourish and grow and to develop a civilization, a successful thriving community, where everybody has the resources that are necessary and it all gets to manifest out of the throat. This is not an easy business that starts in the 19th gate.\n\nThe overview line: The avoidance of contact in general but not exclusively. \"1 don't want to be interdependent with you. I don't want to be dependent on you. I don't want you to be dependent on me because I don't think that any of this will be worthwhile. Why should I give up all this energy when I do not get the resources that I know are necessary?\" Someone says, \"Why don't we establish an ashram?\" The recluse says, \"Excuse me. I am going away because I don't think that it will be possible that you'll really bring in the resources to maintain this, to build a culture.\"\n\nJupiter exalted. The fool on the hill. The sage that, if you can find him, will talk to you. These were the main spiritual figures in the world. These were the crazy ones, the ones that separated themselves and, at the same time, the tribe found them fascinating because the tribe also needs that resource.\n\nPlease understand that the recluse is not quite the same as a hermit. A hermit is somebody where people really know where they are. The recluse or the sulking child can be anywhere; you have to look for them. It is part of their way to have proven that they are really needed. \"I hear that there is a Master in the mountain somewhere, but I don't know where. \" That is their way of knowing that you really need them, if you go looking for them. The sulking child does not simply just go to its room. It goes out and hides somewhere outside and you really have to find them to prove that you need them.\n\nIn the white book: The energy which generally fuels avoidance. \"Well, I don't want to support that. I don't want to get involved in that because I don't think that it will ever get to where it must.\" What happens is that these recluses, these sages, eventually get sought out. The tribe wants access to what they have. The tribe is interested in their resources. The tribe wants them to make a commitment.\n\nThe other side of this: Oversensitivity to rejection that fuels avoidance. This is Mars in detriment. The sulking child. The self-imposed exile that will only end when it attracts appropriate and soothing reaction. Of all the lines of the 19, this is the only line in which the 19 is totally in control. The 19 needs to be wanted but the 19.6 will not flirt, though the 1 through 5 will. The 19.6 generally has a fuel which says: \"Avoid all that. Don't get their attention.\" When somebody comes to the fool on the hill, to the sage or to the sulking child in its room, they are convinced that they are actually needed. \"You climbed all the way up this mountain up to see me?V 'Yes, Master.\" \"You finally come into my room to see what I mean, to see why I am so upset?\"\n\nThere is a great deal of power in this 19.6 by not bringing the classic 19 energy and offering it. Remember that the projected field is sacrifice. You are supposed to be there to sacrifice. The 19.6 does not care. \"Come and find me, if you really need me. And if you show me that you really need me, maybe, if you are lucky and it is a nice day, I will offer you my energy and support.\"\n\nTo so many people who climb that mountain and get to the Master and ask him what they should do, he answers, \"You can go back down now.\" If you finally go into the room of the sulking child, it says: \"Get out.\" It is not enough to be needed. Again, the sixth line is always asking for something much more. So the Master on the hill will wait for the right question, that not only is it really going to be needed, but that need is legitimate, and if it can hear the legitimacy of that, it can support that. The sulking child has to feel the real need, not simply the tribe trying to discipline the child so that it does not miss for aid. That it is not forced to come back out. It has to be a real need to resolve whatever it is.\n\nIt is very important to see that in the whole 19th gate lie so many things that have dominated our lives. It is a core fuel: this need for food, the need for how we can share the food and be interdependent in our process. All the fundamental rules for whether we will support each other or not, the amount of service and sacrifice that is demanded by any tribal relationship, all of that in the 19 carries a great deal of weight in the world. We are going through a process of having this energy vitalized. We have a considerable transit movement through the gates we are talking about, to see how important it is that the resources are there.\n\nThe one thing that is clear to me about the nature of the world is that, unless you satisfy the 19 as a universal theme that is everywhere, there will never be peace. The 19 must be satisfied. The resources must be there and it must be fair. It must be clean and interdependent. That will take a long time for the emotional system to change so that we can break through the motor, and then we can begin to see that the nature of community lies in its spirit. The spirit is the whole thing.\n\nThere are different kinds of sages: there is the sage who tells you, \"You can go down the mountain but if you want, you can come back.\" Each time you come up the mountain, he tells you to go back down. Eventually, they have a satori climbing the mountain one day. They never get to the top and they never have to.\n\nOne last spiritual note on that. What the recluse says when you find them is, \"I don't need you.\" The whole thing about this need for resources is that none of these people can have a life unless they have the resources. There are always those who say, \"I don't need to have you in my life in order to have a life. I don't need to support the tribe in order to get the resources. The resources are everywhere.\" This is something very important because without this force, the whole thing that drives the tribe will only be limited to the material plane, only to that materialism that ultimately finds its expression in the 45/21. What lies here is something deeper that says, \"Wait a minute. Is it really all about need? Is it only about need? There must be something else.\" There is something else: individual awakening in the 25/51. This is the natural way for this sixth line. The sixth line knows that there is something else other than the material plane."

      "hd_title": "The Sin of omission",
      "full_text": "First line, foundation: The sin of omission. Transformation that requires retrogressive periods before renewal can take place. Sun exalted. The will to triumph and in this case the faith that the end justifies the means. All of this is the result of inspiration. The 24 gets an inspiration and, as it says, in the white book: Inspiration that demands a reassessment of past thinking before a rational concept can be established. Is this really the knowing? Do I really know this? I have to go back and see if this is really correct.\n\nThe Neptune in detriment. Self-delusion which unnaturally justifies periods of retrogression. In the white book: Inspiration that leads to an irrational focus on what is past. Everything about the individual is the potential for what is new. They live in a collective and tribal world and the whole thing for them is that they are always looking for the framework. \"Is this something that I can make rational?\" The only way to make it rational is: \"What is it like?\" so then they go back into their knowing system. \"Is it like this or like this? Is it really different?\"\n\nThe whole foundation of the knowing process is to eliminate what is not original because the moment that you see that it is something from the past, the moment that you can reference it, is the moment you put it aside.\n\nThe whole thing about the individual mind is that it has to generate something new. It is not there to produce something that is old. For example, you are working on a piece of music and you have a tune that is running through your head and you think, \"I just came up with a nice tune. That is my tune.\" If you have the first line, there is immediately this, \"Wait a minute, let's check it out. Is it really my tune? Did I hear this somewhere else before? Is it like another song that I heard?\" In the detriment, you get so focused in that that you never sing your own tune because you are constantly going back and trying to figure out: \"Did I borrow this from somebody? Did somebody influence me with this? Is it really mine?\" If it is not really theirs, they cannot keep it."

      "hd_title": "Recognition",
      "full_text": "This line has no introspection. So, here we have Recognition. The Moon exalted. The proper and spontaneous adaptation to new forms. \"I have this new melody.\" There is no checking in this line. Mars in detriment. The vanity to see transformation as a personal achievement rather than a socially supported or natural phenomenon.\n\nWhat you have here is: The potential gift of conceptualizing spontaneously. \"I have this new melody.\" Because there is no introspection and because you just project that out, somebody will say to you, \"That is not new.\" That is a big crash for the 24.2's. \"What do you mean? It is my melody.\" \"That song was recorded in 1972. I have it at home. This song of yours is plagiarism.\" All second lines get into trouble because they are always projecting, without the introspection to go with it.\n\nOn the other side: The mental vanity that such a gift can produce. \"I don't care what you say. It is my melody. I know that it is mine.\""

      "hd_title": "The Addict",
      "full_text": "This is the line of adaptation. Here, the resonance from both the emotional side and the splenic side is bonds made and broken. This becomes very difficult. It becomes a hooking into and a snapping out of the knowing process. This can be very difficult because, after all, this gate is called Returning. It is about going through the process of figuring out what is knowable, what you can know, and what is worth knowing.\n\nThis line is called The Addict. The powerful attraction of regressive forms. Venus exalted. The ultimate though difficult triumph over regression. Jupiter in detriment. Addiction and regression legitimized by success.\n\nThe third line has the capacity to reach out to the other side, though it can be very irresponsible in the way it does that. The 24.3 wants the 61. That is all. It keeps on hooking into the inspiration of the 61 and then breaks the bond with the inspiration. After a while, this becomes very irrational because there is no real work at making it rational. It is irresponsible, after all. It does not matter whether that \"I know\" is knowable or not. \"I know the name of God.\" That can bring a lot of success to somebody. \"I am the son of God. I will tell you about it.\" It is irrational because we cannot know that name. At the same time, success can legitimize that kind of illusion. \"I know what is unknowable.\" That can be something that gets justified by success.\n\nThese individuals have an enormously difficult time because when you meet a 24.3 and if they do get to the throat naturally through the 43/23, their ability to explain themselves is deeply limited and they end up sounding like abstract people. They end up asking you to believe them. They are just interested in the constant flow of inspiration. They are looking for the other side and they try to rationalize it for a moment and then they go over to the next thing. They can be very good at debunking people. When they are mature, they can recognize false knowers. They are very valuable for that. They know who is just making a show to get other people's attention."

      "hd_title": "The Hermit",
      "full_text": "The externalization process in this line is the most anti-social of all mental processes. The individual's primary goal is to preserve its integrity. The individual mind is not there to be influenced. That is why it is so obsessed with checking whether it has been influenced or not. It is there to be original and mutative as a force. When you get to the line of The Hermit, the fixedness of this line is, \"Don't influence me.\" It is always trying to keep influences away and tends to be the kind of mind that works best when it is alone.\n\nTransformation that can only take place in isolation. Saturn exalted. The discipline and focus that assures renewal. Neptune in detriment. The tendency in isolation to live in a fantasy world. That living in a fantasy world is not a negative. It can be deeply creative.\n\nAloneness enriches the potential for rational thought; and Aloneness encourages the potential of illusion or delusion. Aloneness is a keynote here. They are fixed on being alone. The only way that you can get to these people is through the brotherhood/sisterhood, through kindness that can end up as meanness. After a long time, they may tell you what they know and they may listen to what you say. For them to be able to come to a rational point in their process, they need to be alone. I always tell these people the same thing. \"Be alone. Work out your knowing alone.\""

      "hd_title": "Confession",
      "full_text": "The fifth line is the penultimate of a hexagram. It is the part of the hexagram that is the universal element of whether the nature of the hexagram is really there to go into the world.\n\nConfession. The courage to admit the mistakes of the past. One thing to recognize about the nature of knowers is that what the knower knows at any given moment can mutate and a new knowing can replace it. I was an enormously arrogant man who denied all kinds of mystical and supernatural phenomena. I did not only debunk it, I defamed it. The reality is that I had to confess to myself that I did not know. I was ignorant. Now I know. Now I have a new possibility.\n\nThis is one of the important things in the process of an individual: to accept that one did not know. Think about the resonance: the second line goes out and says, \"I have a new melody.\" This fifth line will go out and say, \"You were right. I made a mistake. It was not my melody. It was that old melody you told me about.\" This is what makes the knower acceptable. The moment that the knower cannot make the confession of not knowing, they are no longer acceptable. They will no longer be tolerated and these are the individuals that will really get hurt by the outside, being alienated from the outside. They will really be the freaks that get rejected. By the way, the fifth line of the abstract mind was The Saint, and here we have the Confession."

      "hd_title": "The Gift Horse",
      "full_text": "The sixth line is the line of transition which is moving towards the next step, to the 2.1, where the driver is. It goes directly into an individual process.\n\nThis is the recognition of what is sterile and what is not. The Gift horse. The possibility of being deaf when opportunity knocks. For the sixth line, it is not important whether it can know something or not, or know something which is knowable or unknowable. What is important here is mutation. It is the only thing that is important to the sixth line. Mutation here goes directly to the magnetic monopole (from the 24.6 to the 2.1). It goes directly to direction, to bringing the mutation out as a direction for life and the possibility is that they are going be deaf. They won't hear it.\n\nJupiter exalted. The conscious participation in a process that prepares one for easy identification of opportunity. The other side is: Innate suspicion which leads inevitably to lost opportunities. The 24.6 can always work on the knowing and thus, they can be very good thinkers. None of that thinking is of any value to them unless there is something inside of them that says, \"Aha, this can lead to mutation.\" Often, they look like they are missing something, that they do not really see it. The fact is: they do. They just know if something will not get to mutation. When I say they know that, remember that they may know in that moment and it may not be so, but nonetheless that is their knowing.\n\nIdentification and focus with the rational thought process; or Often irrational suspicion that distorts the focus and can lead to missed opportunities. The suspicion is about whether the knowing will mutate. It is just not about whether it can be known. These are deep knowers. They are very clear people. What they are concerned about is the only thing that will make it worthwhile. Remember the 28.6, Blaze of glory. You can be suicidal in that."

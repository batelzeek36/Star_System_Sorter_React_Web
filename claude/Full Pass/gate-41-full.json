      "hd_title": "Reasonableness",
      "full_text": "Remember, when you are looking at a hexagram, the first line is always going to represent not simply the foundation of the hexagram, but its essential truth. What is its basis?\n\nThe first line is Reasonableness. You can't have all of your fantasies because you will lose your power. You must get one and then go on to the next. Reasonableness becomes the key. The appropriate delegation of responsibility. The first line is looking inward. It has no capacity to look outward. It is interested in what the essential mechanism is. What is fantasy? That is the question that the first line always asks.\n\nWhen the first line of the 41 is a child, they want to know what the difference is between what is real and what is fantasy. They want to grasp that right away. What is fantasy? The appropriate delegation of responsibility; it is the theme we have just been looking at.\n\nRemember that we are dealing with the root center, with the adrenaline hormone, the stress hormone. The root center carries with it enormous power. There is a tremendous fuel at work here. So, the appropriate delegation of responsibility is how to use that energy. In other words, what fantasy, what feeling do you focus on? Don't get caught up in just seeing that fantasy. If you are somebody who is focusing on feeling good about the day and feeling bad about your work and you are a 41.1, you will be very uncomfortable. Either focus on the good feeling (that it is a nice day) or focus on feeling bad (because you are at work), but do not try to focus on both of them. It will not work for you. It will not be productive for you. The assumption of capability is when you look inside and you see you have this fantasy, you think that because you can fantasize it, you can do it. I can fantasize making love to Martians but I will not be able to do it. The reality is that for these people, this is often very difficult. You can see it in the white book. It talks about coolness and the hothead: the cool and hot of the pressure to feel. This is the fundamental duality in fantasy: they are either cool or hot fantasies.\n\nCoolness, where the energy to release feelings is selective. In other words, one is clear about one feeling at a time. By the way, these feelings can come very quickly but as long as they are one at a time, it is okay. The hothead, the urge to release feelings. What happens to these people is that they can get into a great deal of trouble in life because they have within them this need to feel out what is essentially nothing more than a fantasy, with very little odds of realizing it.\n\nRemember that only the fourth to the sixth lines really have the skills to integrate with the energy on the other side. The first line is simply there to look into the nature of the feeling, of the fantasy, but the moment it is trying to live that out, it will get a lot of crises. If they are truly emotional people, they will enjoy their crises anyway. The 41st gate is a potential to release your own feelings and it is also a potential to condition the release of feelings in others.\n\nThe 41st hexagram is a nice meditation. You have to see that we have six steps in our evolutionary process, and we are not at the sixth line yet. We will all have very interesting experiences as a collective (not necessarily individually) with the movement of Neptune and Uranus reaching 41.6. It is an evolutionary process. We have gone as far as the fifth line. So, when you are looking at this process, the first thing to recognize about the very first step is that human evolution was rooted in focus on the feeling, and then you get the experience. That is how you learn. If you are sitting there and you have a zillion feelings, you do not move. There is no way to go. The very first thing that distinguished us was the capacity to have a feeling, the fantasy to focus on that and to hold that focus until the potential, the 30th gate at the other end, to begin a process of actually manifesting that as experience was there."

      "hd_title": "Caution",
      "full_text": "When you come to the second line, you are no longer in the foundation. Now you have this deep genetic need to project the quality of the gate outwards: \"Here I am with the fuel to feel.\" In projecting it outwards, you have the word Caution. Humanism tempered by pragmatism. The evolutionary process begins in the individual, in the single being. The next step is that it has to become something broader than that: collective.\n\nThe two sides of this are Saturn and Mars. A conservative nature that does not risk its own security in aiding others. You can fantasize how you can help somebody and you can then go and focus on that and do it. You can fantasize on helping somebody and not be able to manifest that at all. You can have a feeling for starving children in Biafra and not send any coins. These things are all built into the Saturnian line.\n\nIn the white book: Energy for one's own feelings but not for others. To focus on one's own feelings, one's own fantasies, and not on the feelings of others or whatever their requirements happen to be.\n\nThe Martian side is The energy for the display of feelings for recognition. This is trying to get others to recognize that one is a feeling person. Remember that the second line is projecting outward.\n\nA desire for recognition that throws caution to the winds, depleting valuable resources for only temporary gain. This stream is about desire for change, for experience and about the desire to fulfill one's fantasies. It is the expectation that if one has a fantasy and fulfills it, one is going to get something. The second line is projecting outwards that they have this resource inside of them.\n\nRemember the immaturity of Mars. Immaturity is not a question of good or bad. The immature 41.2, projecting out that they have the feeling that somebody hooks into, may discover that they are terribly equipped for that and it can end up being a crisis because they can be a paper tiger. The fact is that they are projecting something out and do not have the quality of the first line. They do not have this foundation. On the Martian side, they put all the energy into projecting it out. They want people to connect to their feeling. They want to be able to get their fantasy to the next step. This can present all kinds of difficulties for them.\n\nThere is something else about this: already in this second line, which is very rare, there is a need for others. This is the most sexual of all the streams and there is no way that the human experience was going to be allowed to be individual. It wasn't. They are collective and, as such, early (in the second line, a line that is titled Humanism) there is a need to display this feeling for others to fulfill the feeling, the fantasy, the collective process of not having the experience by yourself, but sharing the experience with somebody else. The second line is not equipped. It is Mars; it is immature and it has its problems with that. The exalted line, the Saturnian field, is more secure in that role."

      "hd_title": "Efficiency",
      "full_text": "One of the dilemmas of the collective process is that somebody always starts it. So, in that essence, there is always an individual, a single being, that starts to change events. When you are looking at the whole evolutionary process here, you will see in the dualities of the lines that the exalted tend to point towards doing things by oneself, whereas the detriment says, \"No, we have to involve everybody else.\" The third line is classic of this. Remember that the third line is completing a process. It has qualities of the first and second line. It has completed the process in the sense that it is, within itself, ready to experiment.\n\nThe third line is about trial and error, bonds made and broken. It is about this learning process which is called Efficiency here. In times of decrease selfishness is justified. In that moment of your feeling, what it is saying is: release your energy into that feeling and you will discover whether that is a mistake or not. Wait and see. But release all of your energy into that feeling. That is efficient.\n\nRemember that the adrenaline system, if it is defined in somebody, must be used. This energy must be worked. It is absolutely essential. When that energy is being used properly, that is what efficiency is all about. Because it is a third line, it means that you are not instantly efficient. It means that you have to learn how to be efficient, when to release energy into a fantasy, when to release energy into a feeling. This is not about an awareness that tells you when. It is about a process that, if you don't do it right, it does not work and you learn from that experience and you try to do it differently the next time, as a result of that learning experience.\n\nSaturn exalted. Material ambition and the discipline to go at it alone; and The energy that fuels the feeling for personal ambition. Very much oriented towards someone's rather than the collective's experience. \"I will see how that mushroom tastes. That is my fantasy. I want to feel what that is like. I want to have that experience.\" If the person drops dead after eating the mushroom, nobody else will do it. But if that person has a wonderful trip and sees God and they tell their collective friends, \"Hey, I just saw God. All you have to do is to eat one of these,\" then it can become a collective experience, a collective feeling. What this line is saying is that efficiency is to put your energy into your feeling and your fantasy.\n\nWhen you come to the other side, you have the Moon in detriment. I have my design Moon in this line. I know it well.\n\nInstinctive assistance, admirable but in this position misguided, where two will use up resources more than twice as fast as one. The energy that fuels the feeling to share. I am very individual. This is the only part of me that really is designed to give anything to anybody at any time. One of the jokes in my life is that my son has Saturn in the 41.3. He is always in my pocket. He is the selfish one and I have to share. This feeling that one has to share: now, it is a detriment. Think of the jokes.\n\nThis whole stream is about the human experience and though each of these early lines are geared towards making sure that the evolutionary process goes on, somebody has to take the first step to go across the mountain. There is going to be this force underneath that says, \"Yes, but I have to take somebody with me in order to share the experience with me because otherwise, we do not have a humanity. We just have a kind of a bizarre species but we don't have what will become a strictly human phenomenon, something that we call culture. No culture, no civilization until we share our experiences. By the way, I have an undefined root center and my 41.3 is unconscious, so I do not trust that process. It is always conditioned by others."

      "hd_title": "Correction",
      "full_text": "When we get to the upper trigram, we get to a different kind of process because the fourth and fifth lines are oriented towards the other end of the channel. They recognize the potential at the other side through definition. By their very nature, the fourth and fifth lines are the social lines because it is inherent in their genetic capacity to integrate and to look across the channel for the definition.\n\nHere, we are dealing with a very collective stream, with an experiential stream, a sexual stream. That means we are dealing with very powerful forces. The moment you come to the fourth line, you come to the fixedness of a fourth line. Fourth lines are unidirectional. They are fixed. The first thing we can recognize about that is that, given the nature of this gate, this is a very appropriate line. Decrease is designed to operate with one feeling at a time, with one fantasy you are focused on at a time. So, this unidirectional capacity in the fourth line is of value. You are focused and fixed on your feeling. You are holding back all of this fuel, waiting for the moment that the potential is there because you can recognize that when the potential is there, you can get that energy across, focused on it.\n\nWhat often happens is that 41.4's get locked into being fixed on one feeling, one fantasy, and can be fixed on a certain feeling or fantasy for a very long time, even throughout their whole life because it is this fixedness that is there. But there is a great advantage in that fixedness.\n\nThe line is called Correction. Successful adaptation to limitation. The limitation is, \"I am a fuel. I am not a potential.\" The limitation is very basic. In this line, the Earth is exalted. When we have the Earth exalted, you recognize that it is part of a regular cycle of the Earth. It is something that is going to happen twice a year. It is a very strong grounding force in that sense. Out of the Earth, we get our basic security.\n\nHere, we have a classic line. Survival of the fittest-in the Darwinian concept-and its eventual flourishing. The fixedness of humanity on a feeling, on a fantasy, guaranteed that it would be the top of the food chain. We are to be at the top of the food chain. The survival of the fittest is our movement. The survival of the fittest is the perfection that comes out of being unidirectional in one's fantasy and feeling, to get there finally, to be able to fly, to be able to go to space, to do whatever the case may be and to be fixed on that.\n\nThe Venusian side: The expenditure of energy on maintaining relationships rather than on correction. It immediately goes back into the powerful relationship field. In times of decrease, weak associations are shunned as costly, no matter how attractive. The survival of the fittest is that you are always in the process that you are fixed on but you have to adapt along the way. Otherwise, you will never get to your goal.\n\nHere, the focus is different. The focus is pulled out to the other. Remember that the fourth and fifth lines will always go across. By being pulled out to the other, it loses its fixedness, but it maintains the relationships. That is the other side of it. You have the fantasy that you want to be able to do something in a certain way and the people that you are with do not want to do it that way. They want to do something that is similar, but their way. You do not want to lose them so you go along with that. Thus, you lose that fixedness which is very important. These people can end up being very frustrated because they don't get to live out this experience.\n\nAbout 50,000 years ago, we got to the point of this line. It was probably around the same time that we began to have relationships with animals in which we could not simply kill them but control them."

      "hd_title": "Authorization",
      "full_text": "The first line always gives you the essential truth of the hexagram, but the fifth line is always how it is perceived by the world around us. We know that when we are dealing with the structure of a hexagram, we are dealing with a resonance within a hexagram, the music within a hexagram. The first line is in resonance with the fourth line, the second with the fifth, and the third with the sixth. The foundation of knowing what a fantasy is leads to being able to externalize that fantasy and being fixed on getting that feeling out. In the second line, we saw the capacity to project out this fuel, this pressure within you, this resource for all these feelings and fantasies within you. When we get to the fifth line, we come to somebody who automatically is going to have projected on them that they have this resource, that they have the feeling and the fantasy. \"I know that person will go along with me. I know that they have the same feeling I have.\" This is projected onto that person. They may or may not.\n\nThis fifth line is called Authorization. Think about this in evolutionary terms. This is the stage of our evolutionary process that we are in now. We have given authority (we have projected authority) onto this essential process of experience. From the moment that we entered into this stage of our development, we have had more experiences than we could ever possibly have imagined earlier. The 20th century is full of more human experiences than have ever existed in the whole history of the planet up until now. We have given authority to the experiential way. This is what it is to be human. We go after this and that, and we go to Mars and the stars, etc., until we finally shake hands with God.\n\nAuthorization. The external recognition of one's potential despite limitations. Think about the nature of what it is to have any root gate that has no natural outlet. You have this powerful motor with all this essential fuel, all this essential resource material waiting for that opportunity, waiting within the limitation of only being fuel. Do not attribute awareness to any of these gates. They are not aware; they are fuels. That fuel is not a potential. The 30 is the potential, the 36 is the possibility and the manifestation does not come until you get all the way up to the Progress in the throat. There is a lot of limitation in just having the fantasy or the resource of the feeling. You may never get them out.\n\nThink about the 41.5. They have a greater chance to release their feelings and fantasies than anybody else on Earth because everybody else is ready to project on them that they have a feeling and a fantasy. So, these people are always at risk because they can end up just firing rockets. Everybody comes up to them and says, \"Aha. I know that you want to do this with me. Let me provide you with the potential, okay?\"\n\nMars exalted. That tells you something right away. Whenever you see Mars exalted you know that this is all about 'just let it go.' The value of energy when properly channeled. There are people in America who asked me if this was a channeling line. The answer is yes. It is written here. Properly channeled energy is the whole thing. 'Channeling' in English means to allow the energy to flow properly. The moment that somebody comes up to you and recognizes your capacity to feel or to have a fantasy and they offer you that opportunity, they can do exactly what this gate is all about. You can focus on releasing that feeling or fantasy and getting it out. The immature Mars means to get the feeling out right away, and then it is over. That is the limitation.\n\nThe fuel for properly channeled feelings despite limitations. These people are always being projected upon. They are always given these opportunities. These people are not well. Remember that about them. They can be but, like all things that have to do with powerful energies that are not part of an awareness, given the nature of how human beings see themselves, this can present a great many problems because everybody is projecting on these people, \"You feel for me. Your fantasy and my fantasy are one.\" They are constantly having people project on them, constantly pulling out that fuel at the same time. So, these people can go through a roller coaster of feelings and fantasies. They get burdened by crisis in their process.\n\nIf you have the line and you are aware of the mechanism, it is not that you can change the impact of somebody hooking into it but, by being aware of what is happening, it is much less attractive to be pulled out of your limitation. This is the whole thing about having energy.\n\nI have a defined ego. I will offer my willpower sometimes to others, but not always. Before I became aware of that energy, I was always empowering everybody around me with my will. I do not do that anymore. It is not something that I trained myself. It is a byproduct of being aware of your own nature. It is one of those things that come with the recognition of mechanics.\n\nThe other thing that we always have as a footnote to any of these discussions is that any of these aspects, any of these lines, can only be seen in the context of somebody's design. How those things are going to operate and how they will function is always dependent on the nature of somebody's design. For so many people that will have the same line, it is a different configuration. You have 41.5's that are connected to the Sacral and it is always generating, but it is only really correct for them when they are responding, so they have different rules.\n\nYou have manifestors with the 41.5, where the energy might go through the spleen and go up to the throat and they can always manifest this energy. You have people who have undefined root centers, or you have 41.5's connected to the 30, not connected to the sacral or the throat. These people are called Projectors. What that means is that they have to be recognized by others; otherwise, they can never experience their process. Whatever the line is, it always ends up of being a matter of what kind of definition is there. It is always the key to how the energy will ultimately come out in the life."

      "hd_title": "Contagion",
      "full_text": "When you get to the sixth line, please keep in mind that we are looking at this 41st hexagram as a key to understand our human evolutionary process. When I say human evolutionary process, I do mean strictly that. This time frame that we have, in which we are in these kinds of vehicles and functioning the way we do, we are at the stage of the fifth line, but we are not yet at the stage of the sixth line. We will first deal with the mutation that will bring about the awakening of what we call emotional consciousness, or spirit consciousness. But there is something else that has to take place. One of the more mysterious things that the Voice told me about our evolutionary process is that when the change comes, when we lose these vehicles and we go on to our next process, that this stream that starts in the 41 and goes all the way up, will disappear. It will not exist anymore and this reality is built into this line.\n\nContagion. The law that the maximization of potential not only ends decrease (ends feeling, ends fantasy) but inevitably such transcendence benefits others.\n\nThink about how I describe what the nature of emotional or spirit consciousness is like. We have emotional waves that are being generated and, between those waves as they interact with each other, there is a field, an interactive field, a field where the consciousness actually will exist. We do not understand such a thing. It is not possible anyway to understand it in the logical sense of the word. This is something where our experience of consciousness will be outside of our individual bodies and will not be our own consciousness, but it will be a consciousness that we are sharing with somebody else, or a group of people, or ultimately, a planetary field. Something that is in a slow developing process.\n\nWhen you get to the sixth line of a hexagram, you get to the roof of the house. You get to the end of the process. We know that we find the potential of wisdom in every sixth line and, therefore, it is less likely to function in the nature of what the hexagram is than any of the other lines. It says, \"What for?\" and \"Why should I? I want to see the whole thing.\" You cannot see the whole experiential field. It is not possible. The law is that the maximization of potential ends in decrease, ends this process of constantly needing another experience. This process of constantly going from one thing to the next will come to an end. But inevitably such transcendence (after all, it is transcendence we are talking about here) benefits others. At the moment that we are no longer looking for the new experience, we are all in one thing together, as long as there is not the drive within humanity that it has to be more.\n\nSaturn exalted. The maximization of the potential of form. The father (or the mother) whose success will benefit his children. It is very important to understand that the children of Homo sapiens, if you look at this from the mystical side, will be something else. This transition out of the experiential way, its completion, will lead to the transcendence that not those who do transcend will experience. They will go through a period of discomfort, but what follows will benefit from all of that.\n\nBy the way, that has mundane applications as well, like all lines. The 41.6, when it can make a fuelling commitment to an energy, can ultimately benefit others through that and be of value. It is called Contagion. They can lead all kinds of human beings into an experiential trend. These people can be trendsetters. But ultimately, the major trend, the ultimate trend, the mystical trend, is when we have a lack of experience: when the need for experience, the desire for experience, is left behind. That is when the process is complete. We are not there yet.\n\nPluto in detriment. The tendency in transcendence to keep it a secret in fear of being deprived of its special advantages. This is what we are going to experience in the next century. The way in which evolution works is that we will have pockets all over the planet of different kinds of creatures, like us, that have different capacities than we do, not in any science fiction sense of the word but simply in that they will begin to experience each other, from the moment of birth, in a consciousness field that they will not be able to describe. In most cases, they will never share it with anybody else because it will seem rather bizarre. They will be the ones that are different in the way in which experience is initiated because they will stop it. You will have a generation of children who are born that will have the 41, 30, 36, 35 and they would not appear to us to be abstract at all. They themselves will have a feeling of almost being stuck. They will be the root of cults in the next century that will say that, not only is it all coming to an end, but they are already dying from it, that there is no place to go, that there is nowhere for humanity to go, that humanity is going to die out. They will have a lot of confirmation of that because it will look like that. We will have a vast decrease in population.\n\nHere in the white book: The fuel for recognition through feelings; and The fuel for secret or repressed feelings. Be careful with the words 'repressed feelings'. Ultimately, that is what is going to take place, in that sense. The first thing that will happen is that these feelings will be repressed. The need for experience, the need for fantasy will be repressed, not repressed in the unhealthy sense that we use this language now, but simply because that is going to be the genetic capacity to start holding back this need for more experience.\n\nPlease understand that we are moving towards a time in which we need to be vastly organized, organized in the most intimate way. That organization comes out of the logical field which requires repetition and experimentation, and not out of the abstract field."

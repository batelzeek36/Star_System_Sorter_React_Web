      "full_text": "All first lines give you the essence of a hexagram. It gives you its basic nature. It is its foundation. These lines are introspective. Inner truth lies in going inwards, going deeply into this acoustic field.\n\nThis first line is called Occult knowledge. The foundation of all inner truth is in occult knowledge. We have another example here of Neptune being exalted in a first line. Thus you know that this is not always present. It has been fascinating for me. I have my Design Sun in the 61.1. When Neptune went into the 61st hexagram and activated the 6 all of the children born with Neptune exalted in this line, and who are now six or seven years old, will be great aficionados of the Human Design System. They will be people that will bring an enormous value to our society because we only get the activation of the Neptunian side of this line once every 165 years, and of course, dealing with the 24 on the other side, you have breaks in between which are around 80 years. In other words, there are times when this energy is not available to us and it is very important for us to understand that. Most of the time, the Venusian side of this aspect is working.\n\nNeptune exalted. A natural psychic awareness that empowers principles of universalization. Where a reliance on secret knowledge leads to obscurity and can't bring a universal truth. These are people who really think that they know and they are holding on to it because they think that it brings them power.\n\nPlease understand something about the nature of knowing. Knowing is of no value unless it is openly put out into the world to either be devoured alive or to be a mutation. The moment that somebody has a knowing that they do not want to reveal, automatically, up until the point that it is revealed, it cannot be of universal value. It cannot mutate unless it goes out into the world. It has to go out acoustically; you have to hear it."

      "hd_title": "Natural brilliance",
      "full_text": "When you come to the second line, you come to projection. They are projecting out the quality of the hexagram. So here you have somebody who projects out that they are naturally brilliant. They are projecting out that they know. They are very inspiring. The 61.2 is a very inspiring line. Remember that all second lines can be paper tigers. They can project out their brilliance but they may not live up to the performance. First, second and third lines, because they are not transpersonal, because they are focused on the gate process, they all suffer from the limitation that they are dependent on others. I had nothing to do with my 6 Occult knowledge, until I was late into my thirties. I did not have the forces that connected up my undefined head center and its 61 to bring out the potential that was lying there inside of me. Always look at these things in terms of the nature of the design itself.\n\nThe Moon exalted, and so gifted by this position, a far-reaching, a nourishing influence, free of guile and powerfully attractive. In the white book: A gift for inspiration that is both attractive and beneficial to others. Here is somebody that is automatically putting out this projection that they know, and their knowing is inspiring for others. If what they know does not lead others in the sense that it is inspiring for them, that it acts as a role model of inspiration for them, they begin to suffer from the fact that they can't live up to everybody else's expectations about themselves, and then they begin to wonder who they are, and why it is that way, and why don't they really know what they are supposed to know.\n\nMars in detriment. In early recognition of its influence... (its brilliance, its know-ability) ...becomes ego obsessed with maximizing its effects. In other words: The delusion that any inspiration deserves recognition. When somebody connects to you, you say out of the inspiration \"I know such and such,\" and the other comes with the 24 and gets very inspired and tries to bring that into rational form. When they do, there is this joy for the 61 that the knowing has moved one mutative step and it has become a realization. Because they go through that experience of having that happen to them once, they think that everything they know deserves to mutate.\n\nThere are a lot of very brilliant people in the scientific community who really have a knowing in which they are obsessed with the fact that that knowing will come to some kind of fruition, that it does deserve recognition, and that somebody has to see it. All kinds of people on the fringe of science in America who have all kinds of knowing about the way things work, such as how plants talk to each other, assume that their knowing has to get the same attention as scientific knowing. They assume that whatever it is that they know deserves to be considered as something that is of universal value, and everybody is going to recognize it.\n\nThe brilliance here is the readiness to release their knowing, their mystery. They are projecting out that they know and due to that others can ask what they know, and they either are inspiring or not."

      "hd_title": "Interdependence",
      "full_text": "We have seen that when we are looking at the third line and its process of trial and error that belongs to every third line, you also see in every third line that these relationships with the other side always come as a surprise. The first to the third line is convinced that it is: \"I know\". They are only within the gate process. But the reality is that this line,\n\nInterdependence, says as a heading: It is exceedingly difficult for truth to stand alone. By the way, it does not mean that you can't carry your \"I know\" all the way to the bank. The reality is that it is exceeding difficult because at some point or another, if somebody else does not get to know what you know, it does not mutate and therefore is useless. This is the whole thing about being individual and dealing with mutation.\n\nMutation is very cruel. If you don't know and if you can't explain it, you are really going to suffer; which means that, particularly at the mental level, if individuals don't complete the whole knowing circuit themselves, they have to find other individuals in their process that they can deal with. It will be very difficult for them to deal with people who are mentally collective. For example, I have the 43/23 and the 61, and JOrgen has the 24. That 24 has to come from somebody who is fundamentally individual, like Jurgen. We are both only defined as individuals. It makes it possible to go through that process, but I can do it with an individual. It will be very difficult to bring my knowing directly to the collective. It has to go through the whole process.\n\nThe Moon exalted. The ability to establish relationships for the actualization of truths, and through their nurturing and protective power to ensure a stable environment in which they can continue to grow. Remember, this is the frequency of bonds made and broken. You know that it will be very difficult for the individual knower to really have relationships that can actualize the truth. It is not impossible, but difficult.\n\nThe pressure to know enhanced through collaboration. The thing to recognize is that all third lines, due to their resonance to the sixth lines, are breaking the ground for the potential wisdom and peace that lie within the sixth lines by going through the mistakes, the trial and error. These third line Inner Truth people constantly are dealing with the wrong people. They constantly bang into people that can't help them actualize their knowing. Eventually, if they are fortunate, they begin to recognize that there are certain people that can be beneficial for them and other people that cannot.\n\nMars in detriment. With an abundance of energy and in possession of a truth, the tendency to leave others behind or be crushed by their resistance. Impatience with others and the forsaking of relationships. This is classic: a third line who breaks the bond. \"They can't make my knowing rational the way I want it made rational.\" Remember, you are always trying to be the other side. Everybody who has a question wants to bring their own answer. Everybody that has a confusion wants to make sense out of it themselves, and everybody that has the inner truth wants to make it rational themselves. It just does not work that way. These people are impatient with others. What these people do is: If they do not get their knowing to mutate to the next stage, they abandon that relationship and go on to the next one. Other people can be quite upset by all that. After all, here is somebody that is inspiring for them and that person simply walks away from them. As far as they are concerned, they don't have what it takes. This is their process of trial and error."

      "hd_title": "Research",
      "full_text": "When you get to the upper trigram, to the fourth line, you are dealing with the single- mindedness. When you look at the 43.4, which is part of this stream, you have the One-track mind and this gives you a very strong idea about the nature of this fourth line. The fourth and fifth lines are transpersonal; they are able to recognize that there is the potential for rationalization.\n\nWhat they are looking for, in a sense, is to make music with somebody. They have all the sounds in their heads and the rationalization is just taking away the static so that the station comes in clear, so that you can really get the acoustic picture, if you will. This line, this being fixed on the knowing, is called Research.\n\nThe capacity of concentration to explore the depth of inner truth and maximize its application to fundamental principles. They are fixed on this \"I must know\". In the extreme, these people can really seem to be mad in their fixedness to know. They must know. That does not mean that they will only research things that are valid to research. They can get fixed on trying to know something that is deeply obscure. They get lost for the rest of their lives and they never really know.\n\nI know somebody with this line who is fascinated by numerology. They will spend the rest of their lives trying to figure out what that is all about. They are just lost in that. They have to know it. They are obsessed with knowing. They want to win the lottery.\n\nOn the other side, Jupiter in detriment. Where the tendency to expansion and integration leads to involving others in the research and may end in a diversity of confusing applications. Here you have the two sides of the individual process. The exalted side says, \"This is my knowing. This is my way. Don't influence me. You can go along with me, you can help me out, but don't influence. Don't get in my way. This is my knowing. \" On the other side you have what is intrinsic in the individual. On one side they are resisting all influence and on the other side, they want to be influential because they want to be mutative. The other side is not a negative, like all the detriments. It is simply about seeing the mechanic. These people will lose that control in that sense. They will be very fixed in that knowing. Due to the fact that they desperately want to get to some kind of rationalization, they will involve others who take that inspiration and will go in many directions. That may be of value in terms of all the different directions that the other people take, but it is very uncomfortable for the individual knower who started that process.\n\nThe detriment on this side is: The illusion that collaboration will enhance inspiration. My advice for all individuals: If you are going to be conditioned in your individual mental process, it is better to be conditioned by the planets than to be conditioned by a person. That is clear. It is much easier for the individual because they will always have the sense of \"that is truly myself\". It is not coming from the life experience of somebody else that happens to have that particular gate and brings that energy through."

      "hd_title": "Influence",
      "full_text": "We know that first lines are the essence of the hexagram and fifth lines are how the hexagram is seen by the outside or the totality. The one thing that you can see very clearly about the 61.5 is that the totality recognizes the power inherent in Inner Truth. What is projected on the 61.5 is that they have influence. Think about the difference between the two projective resonances. We have the second line in which the projecting out of Inner Truth results in people saying, \"Aren't they clever? This is a smart one. This is a brilliant one.\" When you get to the fifth line and the outside is projecting onto the Inner Truth, they are saying, \"This is the one that knows. This is the one that really has influence because they can bring about and inspire mutation.\"\n\nHere in this fifth line, Saturn exalted. The enlightened father-figure whose recognized wisdom and powerful assertion can mold a generation by its influence. This is very nice. The pressure to know that may result in influence and wisdom. Think about the advantages of being a fifth line. Everybody is projecting on the 61.5 that they have the inner truth. If they do, their reputation just continues to grow. Ultimately, they are seen as a guiding force and a force of wisdom, which may in fact be so or not. When it is projected on them that they are the ones who really know and what they deliver is unknowable, then all of that will simply crash.\n\nOn the other side of this, Mars in detriment. A tendency in power to want to enforce compliance to ensure lasting influence. The pressure in knowing to resent challenges and demand acceptance. In other words, \"I am the enlightened one. Don't challenge me. I know and you don't.\" This is their stance in that. They do not want anybody to challenge their knowing. Now, of course, they are going to be challenged. The collective would never let them get away with it, and they'd better really know. Otherwise, that challenge can be something that is very uncomfortable for them."

      "hd_title": "Appeal",
      "full_text": "In our process of looking at the lines of transition, we talked about how the nature of the line is that it is looking at the entire circuit. It is looking for the potential fulfillment of the whole circuit before it is ready to make a commitment. This 61.6 is a mutation of that, if you will. It is not quite like any other sixth line. What the 61.6 is interested in is not only fulfilling the whole individual process, the right direction, the role model, the ability to explain it, the social spirit to be able to share it with others, the penetrating awareness that brings it into the existential now. It is all for the purpose of convincing and explaining to the collective how it all works. In other words, for the 61.6 this is not just a matter of trying to make a commitment to the fulfillment of the individual process, but it is a commitment to go beyond the individual process to be actually able to mutate the collective. So there is an enormous lack of involvement in inner truth by 61.6's. They are rarely getting their inspiration out. Why bother, unless that inspiration will get all the way through that whole individual process and be able to mutate the collective field?\n\nIt is called Appeal. Pluto exalted. The profound attunement to the collectivity that can lure the public to a truth. Inspiration that can bring clarity to the collective. Pluto will eventually get there some time in the next 20-25 years. They can bring something new to the collective. A truly mutative gate. But the knowing that lies here as inspiration, remember that inspiration is not awareness, still has to be rationalized. It still has to become an insight it still has to be explained. It still has to go through all of these processes.\n\nIf a 61.6 is just sitting there alone and it does not have any of all the other attributes, it is looking out at the individuals that it meets and the process that it goes through and says, \"I will not tell them what I know. This will never be of any value. This will never be able to mutate that collective.\" It is so common. The moment that a 61.6 is engaged in inspiring others, you know that they are going to have impact on the collective, positive or negative.\n\nOn the Martian side: A reliance on shop-worn cliches and slogans that may be new in their level of energy but inevitably fall on deaf ears. This is the whole problem for the individual. It always has to find a way, a language or a methodology to reach out to the collective that is so different from the individual. So often the individual meets the very thing that they are: deafness. All individuals are deaf. They do not listen to anybody. What they get is a whole collective that is deaf to them as a possibility in their process.\n\nOf course, what that means is that here, in the detriment of the 61.6, there is this sense that you will never be really able to get it across. Let's give them a couple of mantras and see how this works, but basically this is like, \"I am not going to get involved with this because it is going to lead nowhere.\" This is the aspect of, The delusion that inspiration can bring clarity to the collective.\n\nIn the 61 st gate we always have potential delusion until there is a way to explain the nature of that knowing. Both of them are attuned, please understand that. The exalted has the inspiration to bring something new. The detriment can recognize what the collectivity needs. They just don't have the real mutative force to bring it across. They simply know the language for them but not the real knowing inside. So these sixth lines stand back. In standing back and being there in the world, they are part of our world aura. There is always the potential that true mutation can take place and can have a vast impact on the collective. All mental mutation has to have this as its backbone.\n\nUnless individual knowing can be accepted by collective understanding and sensing, mutation has not taken place. The potential to touch the collectivity with awareness at the mental level is rooted here in this sixth line. It is there. The collective exists and the individual at the mental level knows it, and its ordeal is, \"Can I mutate them? Can I get that across to them?\" That is their process.\n\nWith my 3's, I have been busily mutating all of you for years at the mental level because that is part of what the process is: to bring an individual inspiration to the collective mind. Once that individual inspiration is explainable, if then the collective, the logic and the abstract, can grasp it. The mutation has taken hold.\n\nNo sixth line standing back there from the distance sees that that is an easy thing to do. They may become very picky, like all sixth lines, so picky that if you go to the 24.6 on the other side, you end up looking The Gift-horse in the mouth. You become so picky that you do not get to see it when it is there."

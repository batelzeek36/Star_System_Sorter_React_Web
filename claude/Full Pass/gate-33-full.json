      "hd_title": "Avoidance",
      "full_text": "The first line, the foundation of this hexagram, says Avoidance., After all, this is the framework of the identity of the abstract person: avoid everyone until you have reflected and then you can share your remembrance. Then you can offer your witnessing. That is what it is about, offering the witnessing.\n\nThe wisdom in a weak position... ('Weak position' meaning that you finish an experience: that is your weakest point.) ... to recognize that survival demands complete withdrawal. Pulling away is the key to the nature of Retreat. Retreat is there to build strength and abstract strength is built through reflection. Without reflection one can be a fool over and over again. It is okay to be a fool once. If you reflect on it and understand the nature of what you have experienced, you don't have to be the fool the second time.\n\nMars in detriment. Where courage is just plain foolishness. This is a person that will not reflect but jump to the next thing. Or, in the sense that it is the identity out of the throat, \"I will not reflect on my experience and remember it in depth. I will simply babble it all out the moment that it is over.\" The moment that the experience is over, the abstract person does not know anything about it. Whatever they babble out will only be an aspect of the wave that they have been through, and not the proper reflection.\n\nIn the white book: Retreating when one realizes that one is in a weak position. Again, at the end of the experience is the weakest point. On the other side: Unable to retreat when overwhelmed by stimulation. This is the key to that. The abstract person that is pulled from one experience immediately to the next, this is always going to be a problem for them. When you are an abstract person and you are in the middle of a process and, all of a sudden, there is an emergency, if you are drawn away, in that moment, from what you are doing, you lose the value of everything that you have been doing because you won't be able to reflect on it. If you can't reflect on it when the experience is over, you will not remember it. You will not be able to bring out of that the necessary qualities for the remembrance."

      "hd_title": "Surrender",
      "full_text": "When you get to the second line, you get to a projected field and you get to somebody who projects outwards that they are private. They are projecting outwards that they are the reflecting ones. They are projecting outwards that they are the ones that remember. Remember the nature of the paper tiger. They may or may not remember; they may or may not enjoy their privacy. All of these things are possibilities in their process.\n\nJupiter exalted. The recognition that surrender to superior forces... ('Superior forces' are anything that is going to pull you into a new experience. After all, the abstract being is trapped by the experiential wheel. These are people that are really on the wheel. There is this constant pressure on them to enter into another experience.) ...can be an opportunity to expand one's own strength and eventually triumph. What they say does not carry the clarity of their experience.\n\nIn that moment, by not having impact on those that are pulling that out, they can feel like, \"Well, that whole experience was a waste because I did not really get to see what it was. My reflection on that is not of value,\" and they put that out into the world and get smashed for that by the outside because they are not paying any attention to it.\n\nThis is all about the process of development, of being able to project these things outwards, but every time that you have a second line, you always have to see that you are going to be challenged in that process. Anybody who is projecting out is going to meet a very strong challenge coming back at them. The 33rd gate, because it is the gate of privacy, is the gate of being closed in, in that sense. That is, being closed in a room, or somebody that is forced to go into retreat by being sent to jail or by ending up in a monastery, or retreat through illness and states of paralysis. In the second line, you see people that are locking themselves up in a room and, when you get to the fifth line, you can see that the outside world will lock you up in the room."

      "hd_title": "Spirit",
      "full_text": "With the third line, we reach the end of the lower trigram process. Here the bond that is being made and broken is the bond of privacy. These are people that will naturally seek out their privacy, that is part of their process, but it will not be like the second line which is just focused on that. In the third line, there is the beginning of the recognition that there is the other. It is the beginning of that process. It is not really there until the fourth line. In the capacity to adapt is the recognition that one has to come out of the privacy when it cannot just be held back inside.\n\nThe attitude that turns retreat into victory. The victory comes after the reflection. This is the whole beauty. The weakest point is at the end of the experience. The power comes after the reflection and then the real value of the remembrance can bring about victory, the completion of this process.\n\nJupiter exalted. The responsible and principled retreat based on preservation, but with the determination to persevere. In other words, \"Yes, leave me alone now. I have to think about all of this but I'll see you tomorrow.\" This is not \"Leave me alone, I never want to see you again.\" This is the other side of this line with Mars in detriment. A lack of responsibility in retreat. The bridge burner. \"I have reflected on all of this. I never want to have anything to do with you again. It's over.\" These people go into retreat, reflect and break whatever the bond was. This is the kind of person that says \"Leave me alone now. I want to go home and think. I will see you tomorrow.\" The next day, they will call you up and say, \"I don't want to see you anymore, I have thought about it.\" In other words, they can just simply break the bond at that point.\n\nThis line is called Spirit. The spirit that lies within the whole nature of Retreat is that these people are essential for us. If these people do not tell us about the experience, we don't learn. So, there is also a part of us that is trying to get them out of that retreat so that they share their secrets, their reflections, with us. After all, this is a collective gate. There is a lot of pressure on these people to share what it is that they have inside of them.\n\nIn the white book: Privacy as a path to success; or A drive for privacy that will cut off its relationships, often abruptly. All of this is due to the nature of reflection. These people know that they have to go into retreat and they know that they have to reflect, but the moment that the reflection is not positive for them, it is very easy for them to break off the contact. These people can be disliked for that. There is the moment where they'll cut you off and you don't get access to their remembrance, to their experience, anymore."

      "hd_title": "Dignity",
      "full_text": "Remember, you are dealing here with a collective channel, a collective process and identity. The collective is rooted in sharing and when you get to the upper trigram, you get to the transpersonal lines in which they are very much aware that there is a harmonic gate at the other side. The harmonic gate to the 33 is the 13, the Fellowship of Man, the gate of secrets. There are secrets in the 13 that the 33 can be aware of and recognize that it has to get access to these secrets. When it gets access to those secrets through reflection, it can then reveal them. The fourth line of the 33 is as close as you come to finding a line that is religious. I did not say spiritual and I did not say mystical, I said religious.\n\nThe whole abstract process is rooted in belief and this fourth line, which is about externalization and about being onetracked, is called Dignity. A lack of turmoil in retreat.\n\nPluto exalted. The underlying faith in resurrection that turns retreat into an opportunity for renewal and regeneration.\n\nThis is the kind of retreat where people say, \"I have to go and meditate. I have to go and be silent in order to be empowered.\" In that silence or in that retreat, they seek out that power in order for them to feel better about what it is that they have gone through as an experience in life.\n\nBut the terminology itself (renewal, regeneration, resurrection, all of these processes), when you get to the Neptunian detriment: Without the guiding light of resurrection, the inevitable dissolution that leads to degeneration. These people are very fixed on being able to see that what they can reflect on can truly be of value. They understand that they have a responsibility, genetically speaking, to be a witness. There is an aspect of them (see the resonance to the first line, first principle: avoid the outside) that needs this deep reflective process in their life. They will be the kind of people that get involved in all kinds of different levels of meditation.\n\nIn terms of the white book: The healthy retreat for regeneration. \"I need to get away from everything. I need to go through my process and I think things out, and I need to make sense out of my life.\" This is a common attribute for these people. If they can't make sense out of their life, out of that process when they are in retreat, unless they have faith, they are going to get depressed. Unless they have faith, they will feel like the whole thing is just a waste and they can become very sad people.\n\nThese people really need some cosmic level of hope, even if it is not true, that the time in their aloneness is of value for them. They will seek out formulas for that like sitting in a church on Sundays, getting down on their knees on Fridays, going up on the Himalayas on any given day. All of these rituals are there to go through this process of being separate and at the same time, in stillness, with the hope that, in this quietness, somehow life can be resolved."

      "hd_title": "Timing",
      "full_text": "You know that the fifth line operates in a wave that we call 'the seducer and the seduced.' So it is all about seduction. It is one of the things to recognize about the nature of all fifth lines: they all are deeply related to the question of timing. This line personifies that in its name. This is the line of timing.\n\nThe fifth line is always getting projected on. So, in that sense, they are getting projected on that they are the seducer, but because of the projection coming from the outside, it does not mean that they are ready to fulfill that projection at the time when the projection is there."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Disassociation",
      "full_text": "We get to the sixth line, to the transition line. The formula for the sixth line is that they are not necessarily going to be fulfilling the potential of the gate. There is something that is of greater importance to them because the sixth line is not simply transpersonal in the sense that it understands the harmonic gate; in this case it knows the secrets of the other end. It is more than that. It wants to see the whole complete circuit. It wants to see that the reflection covers everything, so that, out of that reflection, the proper remembrance can be established so that humanity can be guided. After all, this is at the root of what we call history and philosophy. All of this information, all of this capacity to be guided by past experience, so much of it is rooted here at the end of this abstract process in the 33rd gate.\n\nWe have a line here of Disassociation. The ability to let go. This is a kind of withdrawal in which the retreat can be so complete that these people can walk through the world and be totally disconnected from it. The nature of reflection can be nothing more than an ongoing personal process because no reflection is really of value to the totality unless it can be a reflection that can add to the experience of humanity and humanity will accept that as a way to see themselves.\n\nIn the white book: The ability to let go in retreat, to enjoy privacy. These people can enjoy privacy for its own sake and feel no pressure to be brought out of their privacy. They can be private all the time. These are the kind of people that are private when they are public or when they intimate. They can always be private. These are people that will always hold things inside of them because there is no sense in revealing what they remember unless it can make a contribution to society.\n\nWe have this funny twist that goes in the abstract. It is very beautiful. When we are looking at the 56.6, at the abstract belief process, \"I can stimulate you with my belief,\" we see that it goes to the 31.1 which is the gate of Influence, the gate of saying \"I lead,\" or \"I do not lead\". So it goes from the abstract 56.6 to the logical leadership. Here, in the 33.6, the very next line is the 7.1. The 7 and the 31 form the channel of logical leadership together. In other words, both aspects of the abstract process, both the mental process and its identity, what they really want most of all is that it is just not another idea. That it is just not another experience. That it can be of value to guide humanity into the future.\n\nHuman beings always want to be what they want. Logical people want to be able to reflect on the past, and abstract people want to be able to project into the future."

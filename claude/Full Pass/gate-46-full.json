      "hd_title": "Being discovered",
      "full_text": "The first line, as the foundation of this, is called Being discovered. Dedication in obscurity that is unexpectedly discovered. This is the whole secret of what this hexagram is all about. Every other place in the abstract process is loaded with expectation. If I do this and this, I will get that. The 46 says: shut up, just be. Just be in the experience for the sake of the experience and only then it can be productive. Then later, afterwards it can be productive through reflection, through seeing what you have actually been through, because if you stop in the middle, you break the flow, you break the continuity, you lose the value and you never have a chance to reflect.\n\nNeptune exalted. Art for art's sake. Any creative endeavor that is self-fulfilling sooner or later is recognized. I tell all of these people: just do your thing for the joy of it. Do not worry about whether it works or not, whether it is a success or not, whether you are loved or not. Just be in it because only then is good fortune possible. Then everybody will say that you were in the right place at the right time.\n\nIn the white book: The potential for creative success through dedication. Just to be dedicated to the thing, to be in the experience, to be in your body. Think about it as your body. Just accept what it is to be you. To be lucky (all over the world people play lottery) can only happen if you are being yourself. To be lucky, in the abstract sense, is only when you are living out your nature. Only when you are living out the experience can good fortune come to you. Otherwise, it can't. Don't stop in the middle of the experience and ask yourself: why am I so unlucky?\n\nJupiter in detriment. The ability to judge the potential of those in obscurity but often solely to benefit one's own success. The determination to recognize and benefit from the success of others. This is a deeply social channel that is rooted in the principle of success. It is 'succeeding where other people fail' or 'failing where other people succeed.' This is all about making the experience of being in the world worthwhile. It is the 29 that says yes to life, and it is the 46 that has to accept the life in the body, in the now, for what it is and to wait for its rewards."

      "hd_title": "The Prima Donna",
      "full_text": "We saw in the 15.2, that the second line was an advantage because it allowed the 15.2 to be seen as an extremist and, therefore, the opportunity of being left alone. When you bring that into the physical body, you come up with The Prima Donna. Everybody looks inside of this person and thinks they see somebody who always thinks that they are in the right place at the right time, doing the right thing. Of course, other people can feel quite uncomfortable with that.\n\nThe Sun exalted. A difficult and demanding nature that succeeds despite its behavior because of the depth of its talents.\n\nThe first two lines are deeply involved with the creative process, obviously. They lay a foundation for the whole hexagram. To accept what it is to be in any experience is inherently a creative process. You will learn from that. Out of reflection can come all sorts of advantages and rewards.\n\nMars in detriment. Unrealistic demands and offensive nature of egocentric mediocrity. Very heavy sounding language. Nicer in the white book: The determination to succeed that may offend others, or The determination to be treated as a success before it has been realized. These people always think that they are in the right place at the right time and they have this air of what people do not like. Others have the sense of, \"How come you feel like being in the right place at the right time and we don't?\" But the 46.2 does not know that. It is a second line. Other people look into them and see that the 46.2's are prima donnas for other people, and not for themselves. They are just in their experience. The 46.2 can be difficult for other people because they are in their experience, but in the end they will accept them. \"They are eccentric, or they are terrible people, but they are deeply talented. Look at the way they dance.\"\n\nWe are dealing with projection lines in the second and the fifth line, so there is a lot of projection going on. Humanity does not feel lucky. People don't feel lucky about their lives, as a generality. Luck is something that people hope and look for and dream about. If you see somebody who is really in their trip, these people do get rewards. They may get rewards even though they do not deserve them, which is really galling to other people. The 46.2, if they are in their experience, no matter how uncomfortable they are as a person for other people, tough. They should be in their experience even if it is mediocre. After all, not all experiences are great."

      "hd_title": "Projection",
      "full_text": "Third line is adaptive. It is part of the lower trigram. So, the first to the third line have the capacity to be in their experience, but what happens to them when they meet the other side is that it can either destabilize them, or not.\n\nIn this line called Projection, we have the Moon exalted. A practical approach to good fortune that maintains the same patterns and attitudes that brought success and does not get side-tracked by indulging in further expectations. In the white book: The determination to stay with what brings success. Think about what happens to these people. They are third line, so they know that they have to be in their experience, and then they meet somebody and that person tries to pull them out of their experience because, the moment they meet them, they say, \"What are you doing? Can we do this? Do you have some time?\" and the third-line person tries to be in their experience, is deeply involved in something and someone taps them on the shoulder and say, \"Excuse me, I have a problem. Can you help me?\"\n\nThe 46.3 has to stay with their thing. This is very practical for them. In other words, they meet the force on the other side but they have to try to get back to being in their experience because that is the only thing that will bring them success. Not what pulls them away. The 46.3 may end up annoying a lot of people who try to break into their experience while they are in there.\n\nMars in detriment. A tendency through projection to treat a potential future as the present, leading to unjustified egoism and the loss of momentum and support. Here comes the ego again. The whole thing about projecting into the future is, the moment that you see that you have an experience, you realize that you need to stay with this experience, and it is not about the rewards you get, but about what you get done, what you get finished. For example, you start the morning and say, \"I'll build this XYZ,\" because that is your pattern, because you want to be able to fulfill that. You want to be in the experience of doing that. You can be the kind of person that says to somebody, \"This thing is going to be ready for you tomorrow.\" Well, this is not existential. The fact is that the third line does not know whether or not they will be left undisturbed because, the moment someone comes into their aura, it breaks that moment of experience. They may not get back to that successful pattern and may end up being somebody who sounds like they're always making promises and not keeping them.\n\nIn the white book: The determination to treat a projected success as a reality. By the way, like all of these lines that sound negative, they are not. There are those 46.3's who, out of that experience, learn to find people in their lives that do not disturb them that way, because this is inherently social. They realize that when they meet 29's and they have to make a commitment, it is not the commitment that is important. It is the people that are important because all of this has to do with social context. The fact of the matter is that in the third lines we have the strongest learning process. This is our trial and error process, and it will take them time to live that out."

      "hd_title": "Impact",
      "full_text": "We are dealing with very specialized collective gates which, obviously, by their very nature are social, and we are dealing here with transpersonal lines. As I mentioned before, the 15 and the 46 have very unusual lines and here, we come to them in the major transpersonal lines in the fourth and fifth. Normally, the fifth line is exalted and the fourth line has its difficulties. Here you have fourth line that is exalted, and it is called Impact.\n\nThe Earth exalted. It is there right from the beginning. The ability, once recognized, ('once recognized' means, though, that there is a process involved) to move rapidly from a position of obscurity to influence. These are people that know how to externalize their experience in the now. They know how to get other people not to get in their way. They are good at that because they are one-tracked. They are fixed on their experience but not to the point of exclusion of the other because they have social gifts. So, they know how to keep to their experience without alienating those people around them and by finding valuable allies to help them fulfill their experience.\n\nThe moment that they are recognized, they rapidly move upwards because they have really good skills and they can stay in their experience. The only thing about these people is that their experience is everything and, though they have very good social skills and you really think that they are nice, and they may be, the fact is: they do not pay much attention to other people even though they have the social skills for them. They don't. They are in their experience.\n\nYou see that more in the other side of this: Pluto in detriment. A reaction in achievement that tends to bite the hand that fed it. By the way, this is very much the propaganda of those people that have to meet the 46.4. The fact is that they really are just in their experience. They can forget that you once helped them along that way. It is not that they do not care about you. It is not that if they were really confronted with it, they would not realize, \"Oh, yes, I did not realize that I did that to you.\"\n\nThese are often people that have psychic crashes. They end up sitting at a therapist's desk because they suddenly realize that they have crushed a lot of people and they did not even know that was happening. Poor things, it is not their fault. Imagine trying to cure somebody of that. It is not their fault."

      "hd_title": "Pacing",
      "full_text": "We have an exalted fourth line and a detrimental fifth line. Fifth lines are normally the exalted lines. This is probably, of all the 64 hexagrams, the weakest of all fifth lines because of its social and abstract nature, and because we are dealing with pure projection. In terms of the projection: this is what society is looking at. What society wants to see is that there is a pacing and that everything has its kind of process so that success can be worked out. Everybody projects on the 46.5 that they are the ones that can always be successful. Remember that the 29.5 is about failure and the detriment in the 29.5 is about guaranteed failure. So here, when you are dealing with the 46.5 you are dealing with the consequences of what happens to projection on this abstract gate. What happens is in its language.\n\nThe Moon exalted. The maintenance of proper rhythm... (Rhythm does not belong here. Rhythm is the 15th gate.) ...that in its instinctive practicality... (Instinct does not belong here but in the tribal circuitry.) ...avoids radical divergence from successful patterns. (With patterns we go back into the logic again.) The abstract process is intended to be existential. It is not intended to stay with things. This is not what it is about. It is an existential process in the experience. The cycle of the experience can be 10 minutes or 25 years, but the abstract being is here to go through an experience, to reflect upon it and go on to another experience.\n\nIf you are an abstract person and you are working as a salesperson, if you see a different client all the time, that is healthy. You go through the process, the experience. It is existential and you get to reflect on it later. \"That person was nasty. He/she was a bad customer,\" or \"This product sells; the other one doesn't.\" In other words, you get the whole picture from that. The moment that you deal with servicing that customer and you see that customer day after day, it will all fall apart because that is not an abstract process. You can have the experience for a while to see what it is like to service people, but you are not going to stay with that.\n\nBut here, in the fifth line, it is projected on these people that there should be stability in this. So what happens is that people come along and project onto the 46.5 that they are going to be a success in whatever they are doing, and these people get stuck in that. They get conditioned by the outside to get stuck in a certain experience and what brought them early success ends up failing.\n\nThe 46.5 is walking along the beach and they look down and see some money on the ground. They pick it up and put it in their pocket. They are very pleased and continue their walk. Then they sit in a cafe with a friend who tells the 46.5, \"You are the kind of person. You are always so lucky. You can make a living just walking up and down the beach, picking up money.\" Off they go and they find some money, this day and that day. Each time they find something, it gives them a little confidence to stay with it, and they will find more until they quit because this is what happens to them. Their possibility for success in the moment gets recognized by somebody else, projected on them and then they get stuck in that pattern. The maintenance of proper rhythm that in its instinctive practicality avoids radical divergence from successful patterns.\n\nNeptune in detriment. An irrational... (That is the knowing circuit.) ...rejection of the very patterns that have proven successful. So, to understand that is to also understand that, to everybody else, it is irrational. It is projected on them. \"How can you stop walking up and down the beach picking up coins? You are so lucky, you will always find something. You are crazy to give that up.\" 46.5's are driven crazy by other people. If you have a 46.5 client, tell them to learn about people and to understand that when people project on them they are a success, they want something of it. They want to share in it. The 46.5 ends up with commitments that are devastating for them. The most devastating commitment for an abstract being is a commitment that says, \"I am going to stay with the pattern.\"\n\nIn the white book: The determination to stay with the rhythm which brings success; or Determined to say no to the very rhythm that brings success. By the way, that saying no to the rhythm (i.e. the \"cycle\") is after being projected into it and then discovering that while you stay in it, it does not work and then you say no to it and you get out of it. Very difficult position.\n\nThe whole thing for the 46 who does not have the whole channel and is looking at the 29: it is who you do the experience with. Everybody thinks that commitment is about the thing. For the abstract person, it is not the thing but who you do the thing with, because it is collective. So, you cannot avoid going through those experiences where you get into things through other people's projections, to see what it is like and then to say no to them when they then get upset. \"Why are you saying no? If you stay with this, this is going to be that.\" You just have to accept that that is a pattern for you."

      "hd_title": "Integrity",
      "full_text": "If you look for a place of real wisdom in the abstract process, that's when you come to the 46.6. We know how sixth lines rise above any given situation and that when they are young, they get involved in what their line is all about and they learn very quickly that that does not work very well. This line is called Integrity and it is a Saturn/Neptune combination.\n\nSaturn exalted. The wisdom to secure one's identity through careful consideration of the restrictive potential of commitments. Neptune in detriment. Deceiving oneself and others by over-extending one's resources and eventually being in the position of having to break promises. The 46.6, like the whole 46th gate, has the quality within them that if they do accept the experience that they are in, there is going to be reward.\n\nThe other thing is that they have to be in the experience. The 46.6 learns very quickly that it is not the experience at all that is the thing because it gets to see the whole circuit. It gets to see that the whole circuit is based on the impersonal contact between humans. They realize that the abstract process is faulty in the sense that the experience itself takes one away from the real wisdom that is possible, because it is the people. Like in collective sexuality in the 35/36, 41/30, what you have is experience and excitement that has nothing to do with the actual person. The one thing the 46.6 knows is that success is absolutely dependent on the other person, and that the experience is just a catalyst, but it is the other person or the collective sharing that can result in real success.\n\nThe 46.6 is not limited to just looking at this drive in the sacral center to say 'yes' to life, to experience, to commitments. It goes beyond that. It looks into the whole circuitry. It sees the obsession. It sees the crisis. It sees the progress. It sees the possibilities that are there. It sees that experience can make a contribution to the direction of humanity.\n\nRemember, the direction of humanity is towards beauty, aesthetics and harmony. That is our direction. The reality is that only an experience whose net value is to show the beauty and the harmony possible in human direction, only then is that experience worth having. That is quite a criterion. You can sit up there on the fence for a long time to wait and see, to find that experience that, being in it, ultimately, is of value to humanity."

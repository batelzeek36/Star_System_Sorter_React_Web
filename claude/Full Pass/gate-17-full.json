      "hd_title": "Openness",
      "full_text": "This foundation line is called Openness. Mars exalted. The energy to sustain a broad spectrum of stimuli. When you are talking about the first line, you are talking about the true nature of the hexagram. Venus in detriment. A tendency to limit openness to aesthetically pleasing stimuli. Both of those are about the capacity to always have opinions. This is a very opinionated line.\n\nThe exalted is about The possibility of having many opinions. That is the nature of this gate. There are many opinions to have. After all, everything that has a name, everything in your vocabulary, you have an opinion attached to it; otherwise, you could not have that name in your vocabulary because it comes out of opinion. So we have loads of opinions. The 17.1 is full of all of these opinions.\n\nThe other side is: The possibility to limit opinions to what is pleasing. These people have opinions about what they like to have opinions about. Things that they are not interested in, they don't have opinions about or they do not tell you about them. In other words, their opinions are about things they like to have opinions about. These people, for example, have opinions about art. That is what they love to have opinions about. They have no opinion about politics. They are very much locked into that because that is what pleases them. They want to have a critical capacity only when it comes to art. The 17 is opposite the 1 8th gate. It is full of challenging authority. It is full of criticism. These are the opinions that are attached to every name. The 17th gate entails a built-in experimentation that is taking place within about the value that any name has."

      "hd_title": "Discrimination",
      "full_text": "We come to projection here. This line is called Discrimination. The benefit of associations based on highest values. This line (and the whole hexagram) is always about two things: is one serving, or is one trying to rule? Is one serving one opinion, which means that somebody asks you, or the situation asks you, are you trying to rule and to impose your opinion? Are you trying to rule with your understanding? This is always the dynamic tension that exists within this hexagram, between serving and ruling. Here you have the classic in the projection and, as you will see, by the time we get to the fifth line, it becomes something quite special. It becomes No human is an island. It becomes something very important to understand in our nature. In the second line we have the beginning of this process.\n\nSun exalted. The successful achievement of purpose through proper alignment. 'Proper alignment,' in this case is: The possibility to develop opinions through relationships. Somebody says to you, \"What do you think?\" Then you can project. If nobody asks you what you think, you can't project.\n\nWhen you come to the other side of this, you have the Moon in detriment. An overactive discrimination that leaves one virtually alone. The possibility of being opinionated at the expense of relationships. This is trying to rule. This is the other side, the side that cannot wait to be asked. They have to project it outwards. In the moment of projection, they are trying to rule with their understanding. Please, recognize something about that. They may be right. It is always true in all of these gates. Do not bring any moral judgment to the fact that they operate through their polarity. Both sides can be right or wrong. But the nature of the way in which it works is that they are always trying to rule with their understanding.\n\nThis is a collective circuit. It is about sharing. One can only rule when they serve, which means that you have to be asked first. This is the tension that exists in the 17th hexagram. It is much easier for people who have the 17 without the 62. The 17 without the 62, by the very circumstance of not having the whole channel, has to wait for that opportunity to be asked, or the opportunity that the situation asks them because, suddenly, it is activated. It is very different when you are dealing with the 17/62. Like the 43/23, it can become an automatic loose canon. It just blurts out and the understanding is imposed on somebody else. They may not like that. It may be right or wrong."

      "hd_title": "Understanding",
      "full_text": "When you get to the top of the lower trigram, you get to the line of adaptation, the line of bonds made and broken, of irresponsibility. It is called Understanding. The awareness that the best road is not necessarily the most interesting. The best road for any opinion is towards detail. That is what is meant here. The only thing that makes an opinion worthwhile is if it is substantiated by appropriate detail.\n\nPluto exalted. The following of the best road provides the experience necessary to meet the challenge of the road's end. In the Book of Letters: The understanding that the best opinions are grounded in detail. Opinions need to be substantiated; otherwise, experimentation will never take place. Remember the difficulty of the logic process to find energy. Only the best opinion has a chance to get and attract that energy. If there are any loopholes, they will always come up in the experimentation.\n\nThe Earth in detriment. The taking of short-cuts. One may get to the end quicker, but essential experience will be missing. The possibility of skipping details and limiting the value of the opinion. The fact is that every time an opinion does not have enough detail, there is always going to be somebody out there (I call them the money lenders) that says, \"Well, you'd better go back to the committee room because we are not ready to invest yet in that experiment because we noticed that you did not have form ZW 21926 done and you have to get that form done before we can even consider it.\" You have to have all of the details."

      "hd_title": "The Personnel manager",
      "full_text": "We come to the upper trigram and this line of externalization. It is a one -tracked process, but it is the mirror image of The Teacher on the abstract side that we looked at. I mentioned at the beginning that what we are looking at is the Aquarian potential to the Piscean teacher on the abstract side. Here it is called The Personnel manager.\n\nPluto exalted, a lovely place for Pluto. The ability to probe and discover the underlying motivation and resources of those who wish to follow. Here we find the gift to be able to really understand others. One cannot rule until one understands others. It is essential because to rule means that you must serve the other. That is the nature of ruling. That is why the Chinese had this tradition of the superior man as a ruler. This superior man served as a ruler. He served the interest of the people above and beyond his own interest. This is the nature of true service: as a ruler being the one who serves.\n\nJupiter in detriment. The overgenerous and often misguided acceptance of would-be -followers, often with disastrous results. The Personnel manager has the gift of being able to say, \"Here is the pattern and here is where you fit in because I understand what you need.\" Given the nature of ignorance in the world, this can be a very frightening thing in the way in which it actually gets applied and there are an enormous number of people that get manipulated this way.\n\nIn the Book of Letters: The possibility of opinions based on the understanding of others. \"I understand how this works and I understand how it works for you, and in that I can serve you.\"\n\nThe other side is Jupiter in detriment. The possibility of opinions attracting others. This is really a capacity to attract others and bring them to this order. This is all about order. This is the design of an organizational being.\n\nEverything about the mental logic process is figuring out how to get everybody to fit into a cubbyhole, something everybody hates. One of the ironies for me is that the ability to see where everybody fits in, which is the capacity that lies within this knowledge, would be in many ways deeply offensive to a great number of humanity in the sense that it would appear to be manipulation, which it is not. It can only come at a time when people really understand from a very early point.\n\nThis is a strong manipulative field: bringing people to understanding through the ability to externalize that. But it is a very fixed understanding. This is not universal understanding. This is just externalization. It is trying to get your opinion across and it is a gift of attracting people to your opinion. It is very common to see that in politics, for example when you have a one-opinion candidate like Le Pen in France. He is a one-opinion politician. \"I understand that this is bad,\" and then he works attracting everybody to that one opinion. They get very fixed in that."

      "hd_title": "No man is an island",
      "full_text": "The fifth line has a special significance. One of the things to recognize about the nature of this line is its resonance to the 18.5, which is its opposition. The 18.5 is the line of Therapy; on one side, the capacity to both seek and provide guidance, and on the other side, chronic instability and the mental patient. Here, you find the mirror of this. This is an important mirror because what the fifth line in the 18 talks about is the inability to do it alone. Here, we have the line of No human is an island. The recognition, however understood, that there is no end to hierarchies.\n\nUranus exalted. Please understand the significance of that. We will have Uranus transiting this gate in about 14 years. This will be an enormous event. Uranus exalted: The ultimate creative expression of interdependency, whether as god's will or global synthesis. What you see here is Opinions that can express the value of being organized, whether mundane or spiritual.\n\nThe greatest service of the logical process is to finally be able to allow everyone to have exactly their place in resonance. If everybody is in their place in resonance, everybody has a complete process and the totality has a process far beyond that. This is an Aquarian process. That is why you have Uranus here that is establishing the exalted. We will have a very important transit of this which will have an enormous impact, not in terms of when it happens. The most important thing to see about transits is that every time you look at a date in the ephemeris, remember that millions of babies are being born.\n\nThe transit of Uranus through that gate (it stayed there for a year and eight months, and it stayed two or three months in that line), will have an enormous impact because all those children will carry it as their genetic material. We will have a whole new generation that, from the very beginning, is open to this global synthesis, and they will be born all over the world. It will not be limited to any particular place on the planet.\n\nMars in detriment. The arrogance, despite all the evidence to claim, that the buck stops here. We see this in the world today with what fundamentalism is: the last gasp against the globalization that homogenizes everything, the world where everything simply gets homogenized and brought together. There is a deep resistance to that. On the other side of the Uranian power is the old, primitive resistance to being organized and it is the vanity to assume that where you belong in this life is up to you, not God's will, not global synthesis.\n\nThe possibility of opinions that refuse to see the value of being organized. It is not about whether these people are good guys or bad ones. It is simply about recognizing that there is always going to be a tension because we have not reached the point yet where we are socially organized. I can't remember the details exactly but they have a scaling system of how to list the social possibilities of species.\n\nAt the highest level of that, it is based on a number of criteria. It is based on three generations living together, the ability to communally interact and to support each other in times of stress. It ends up with a fourth step which is about the fact that the species is reproduced selectively. So, the highest members of this social organization business are ants, termites and wasps. We are going there. These insects are very organized. Humanity is very different. We have this enormous self-consciousness at work but where we are going towards is this highest level of organization which will really be fulfilled when we have spirit awareness and we can create our consciousness outside of our forms.\n\nBut there always will be this resistance. What is coming is a genetic transformation. It is not about what you want it to be. We have a genetic transformation at work. There will always be recessive genes. These will be the recessives. They will say \"I refuse to be organized.\" They will fight being organized and ultimately, some time deep into the next century, we will have this dilemma between those who are ready to be organized and those who refuse to be organized. That is going to be the political fault line of the future. In order to universalize out of this fifth line, obviously, the pattern really has to work, whatever it will be.\n\nI have a great Mc Donald's story. Mc Donald's opens a new outlet every three hours and in Nov. '96, they entered their one hundredth country. The thing that is so fascinating about that is that in the 100 countries that now have Mc Donald's, there has never been a war between them."

      "hd_title": "The Bodhisattva",
      "full_text": "In the 18.6 we have Buddhahood, the spoilt one. Here, The Bodhisattva is the spoiled one. If other people are not there waiting for their pronouncement, they get very upset. They understand what is good for everybody and they expect everybody to be there. By the way, they just might. That is the other side of it.\n\nThe Bodhisattva is quite a role. The capacity is truly there, but again, like all sixth lines which are transition lines, two things are always there in the transition. One is this sense of not giving what you are, not giving understanding because it is not worthwhile. You want something much greater than that. You want to see everything organized. It is not enough just to understand; you want to see it immediately implemented so you can see all of that organized. That is what is interesting for this sixth line. Most of the time, the understanding does not necessarily come out because there is this immediate recognition (no energy) that it is not going to be able to get organized.\n\nPerfected following, one with and the same as perfected leading. Moon exalted. The great nurturer. The nature of this position is always positive, (including the detriment). Jupiter in detriment. The tendency on the perfected path that it is a straight line that ends, rather than a circle.\n\nIn the white book: The possibility in understanding the nature of interdependence to express opinions of value to others.\n\nBut the fact that it is a possibility does not mean that you will do it. This is the kind of being that is not going to share their opinion with you if they don't think that you will not do anything about it. The moment that you are saying to them, \"Give me your opinion and tell me what to do,\" these people love to have people come to them and say, \"Oh, Master. What do I do?\" The Master sits there and says, \"Don't...\"\n\nThe role is to organize, if somebody comes to them and says, \"Oh, please tell me what I should do?\" They are ready because the organization can take place. \"Let me organize you.\" But if they can't organize them, then they don't do it. One of the things about these people is that they are often deeply attractive because they don't offer you the understanding unless you ask them, unless you go to them, unless you express a need for that.\n\nThe detriment: Where understanding is achieved, the possibility of having the opinion that there is nothing else to learn. These can be very arrogant people. I have met this many, many times with people who have the 17.6 and they are astrologers, chakra workers, or whatever esoteric field. They always have the same response, \"I don't need to understand anything else. I have this.\" There is always that aspect to them as well. 'The tendency on the perfected path' and you think that this is it.\n\nThe whole thing to recognize about the inherent danger in both collective processes is that both of them are at the mercy of mutation. The organization of humanity is not going to take place until a mutation takes place. This mutation will change the way in which we will reproduce. It will make it very difficult for our species to reproduce. It forces us to be organized. This will come out of mutation."

      "hd_title": "Taking Stock",
      "full_text": "The first line is always the foundation. It is the beginning of a process and it is introspective. This is a classic line for that because it is called Taking stock, and that is what taking stock is all about. It is a real introspective process.\n\nSaturn exalted. The ability in times of hardship to concentrate on eradicating the negative factors that have led to oppression. This hexagram is always in hardship because it is trying to realize and to make sense, and it has always got the sequences coming. Whenever one is looking at the past through this gate, you are trying to figure out what went wrong, in that sense. You are always looking to see why it didn't work the way I wanted it to work, the way it should, could or might have worked. You get to a point where that kind of a mind is trying to eradicate what went wrong in order to come up with an idea of what could be right. This is the nature of this kind of a mind.\n\nIn the detriment: The delusion of seeing oppression as an exclusively external phenomenon with often disastrous results. In other words, I have to make sense out of this stuff, not because of me but because of what they did. \"If it wasn't for them creating all these problems, I wouldn't have to think about that all the time. It is their fault. I wish they would stop.\" That is the other side of this line. You have to recognize that this is the foundation of oppression: you are either trying to correct or fix, trying to make sense out of what did not work in order that you can come up with an idea of what will work, or you end up constantly feeling like \"I will never be able to come up with an idea that will really work because it is them and not me and I have to be the one that suffers.\"\n\nIn the white book: The realization that negative thoughts have to be eradicated. Please understand that that can become quite obsessive. This is constantly dealing with what happened yesterday and the day before, trying to clean that out and trying to work it out and make sense out of it.\n\nOn the other side we have: The sense that the world is against you. It is all their fault. This is the beginning of the abstract mind. That is why it is desperate for ideas. It wants to get out of that."

      "hd_title": "Ambition",
      "full_text": "The projection line is about the inability to take stock, to be introspective, and it is simply the need to project outwards. One of the things that are so funny about this line is that its resonance, the fifth line, is called The Saint. This is the training ground for saints and it ends up seeming exactly the opposite. It tends to be quite chaotic. The nature of this projection is that the only way to escape the past it to be busy in the present. This is the key to understanding this second line. I always tell this second line the same thing: be busy.\n\nIt is called Ambition. Saturn exalted. The ambition and drive to overcome personal oppression in order to achieve security, which means that these can be people that are quite disturbed. 'Disturbed' in the sense that they cannot make sense out of something and it really bothers them. What they do is that they get involved with something else to try to get away from it. But as we well know, you carry everything with you. So, while they are being busy, they carry that with them. It always catches up to them. They ultimately have to deal with it one way or another.\n\nMercury in detriment. An indecisiveness in times of personal oppression, whether to apply intelligence to recovery or accept its weight to take advantage of other prevailing conditions that may only be temporary. What that is saying basically is: When I have that, my biggest problem is what do I do? I know I should be busy, but what should I be busy with? If I don't know what to be busy with, should I really look at this problem and try to realize my way out of it? If I can't do that, what should I really be busy with? This can be very confusing.\n\nIn the white book: Realizing that to be busy is mentally healthy. Otherwise, these people get sick. It is classic. If you have a 47.2 and you are not occupied, if you do not have something to do that is of value to you, you will get deeper and deeper into that because you cannot look inward. Remember, this trap of the second line. In other words, they can't realize it anyway. They have to surrender to that and, of course, it is only the beginning of a maturing process in the hexagram. They are not ready until the fifth line, its resonance, to really be able to surrender to their oppression. The second line just simply projects outwards. One of the most important things for these people is quality busy-ness, and the best thing, because of its Saturnian nature, is to make money. This is very good for 47.2s."

      "hd_title": "Self-Oppression",
      "full_text": "Remember that the abstract process is connected very strongly to the emotional wave. If you look at the third line emotional wave, you have the wave of bonds made and broken. The third line is a line of adaptation and, as such, it is the first opportunity in which, within the hexagram, there is this possibility of looking across to the other side. It is called Self-Oppression.\n\nJupiter exalted. The conscious and well integrated being whose natural right action will eventually come to see the unfoundedness of its oppression. All that is saying is that all this stuff I keep remembering, I keep remembering and there is nothing I can do about it, but basically today I am okay. That is the highest level of this line. It is this 'okay part' that is so important in this.\n\nThe Martian side is: A self-oppression so highly energized that it may prove irreversible and destructive. Going back into that mental process, you cannot make any sense out of those mental pictures. That is the self-oppression. You cannot make any sense out of them at all and you cannot say, in that sense, that today it is okay.\n\nIn the white book: The eventual realization that one is really o.k. Everything about the abstract process is rooted in ultimate crisis: death and rebirth. This is the beginning, the middle and the end of things. Ultimately, you come to a point where you go through the field of crisis and you can come out with the third line and be able to say, \"Yes, my mind gives me a hard time but I am okay.\"\n\nWhenever I work with people that have the 47.3, 1 tell them something very straight forward, \"Your mind is your enemy. It does not have to ruin your life.\" It is the enemy for them because it is always going to be oppressed. For them it feels like, \"Oh, my lifel This does not work. That did not work.\" The possibility for them is to realize that that is simply their mind. That is not what they are living day to day, moment by moment. It is simply an aspect in the way in which their mind operates. That is easier said than done. But the fact of the matter is that, particularly for the people that have the 47.3 activated in an undefined ajna, it is much easier to discover that life really is okay and that oppression is just the way their mind works. The other thing to recognize about this is that this is an experiential path and, as such, if we don't have the 47.3's we don't have the best counselors available for what self -oppression truly is.\n\nThis is the whole thing about so many lines that appear to be difficult. Without those human beings that can transcend the difficulty of that nature, we would not have people who would be able to guide us. After all, the talent of the abstract way is through experience. \"I went through all these years of being self- oppressed. Let me tell you how this works. It does not have to ruin your life. I have had the experience. Let me explain it to you,\" says the 47.3 who has gone through that.. Remember, they are historians. Every single aspect of this hexagram is difficult because life is difficult, and it is extraordinary difficult to make sense out of life. That is why we need logic. That is why logic is healthy. So, it is an ordeal for these people and yet at the same time, they are the ones that can guide us through what that ordeal is.\n\nIn the experiential way, that is the most important information you get. You get a map from somebody else who says, \"You know, I have been there; let me tell you about it so that we can share this together.\" One of the important things to recognize is that the experience that is built into this is not by its very nature negative. That is not a moral question. It is of enormous advantage to us. If you are doing a reading for somebody who has the 47.3, the only thing that you can point to is: What in their chart can they really rely on to see that that is their life? For the people that have that as their only definition, the 64/47.3, this is a very difficult life. For them, it is very difficult to see that their life is okay. They can only learn to see that certain conditioning is okay."

      "hd_title": "Repression",
      "full_text": "With the fourth line, you get to the upper trigram and you get to externalization and to the one-track- process. Think about that in terms of the emotional wave of kindness/meanness; it is the Brotherhood/ Sisterhood. If you look at the fourth line of the 30th hexagram, it is called Burnout. That is one of the things to recognize about the nature of this fourth line. The fourth line is very much aware that there is another side. I use the word hope for the inspiration of the other side. It is all part of a belief system. It is hoping that what is one the other side can relieve it of its oppression. Instead, it ends up seeing that, not only can the other side not do that, but it is the other side that is repressing them.\n\nThe constraints of external oppression. Saturn exalted. The strength of identity that even in times of the most powerful oppression can maintain its resources and to some extent ensure survival for the benefit of others. These people have a very fixed thing that they cannot make sense out of. They may be able to make sense out of all kind of things but there is one thing (the fixed nature of the fourth line) they cannot make sense of, and that is the thing that disturbs them the most. That is the thing they are always trying to get resolved and they can't. It is always something from the outside and they are hoping that the outside somehow resolves it. Looking, trying to externalize for that experience.\n\nThe other side, the Moon in detriment. When robbed of its light, the Moon is lost in darkness, barely able to nourish itself, let alone others. These people can be very dependent and, the moment they get overwhelmed by that external repression, they can become so dependent that they can become psychically so weak, they burn out. When you have one thing and you cannot resolve that one thing, the rest of you is not healthy. It just keeps burning and burning.\n\nA sense of identity that can be maintained despite external conditioning. These people always get it. It is not that they are making this up. They are not crazy. If you are born with a 47.4, you have to deal with all kinds of forces on the outside, like everybody else, except the 47.4 takes it personal. We all have to deal with external repression, oppression, all of us, but we have a different way of dealing with that. Each in our own particular styles. These people are always fixed on that.\n\nThe identity overwhelmed by external conditioning. They are so dependent on the other that they collapse. These are, for example, people that got something in their head that they want somebody to fix for them (their therapist, the doctor, their guru). Everybody is trying to condition them away from that, trying to solve it for them and it does not work. They really go mad. They can really burn out. The best therapist for them is the 36.4 because it brings them the correct crisis."

      "hd_title": "The Saint",
      "full_text": "When we come to the fifth and sixth lines, we notice that they are both singularities. These are two out of the nine lines throughout the 384 that are singularities. The fifth line is The Saint, this resonance from the projection out of Ambition, this being busy. The second line is being busy to escape and the Saint is being busy but not as an escape. There just is nothing else to do. Why get involved with all of that oppression which is just going to catch you up in the whole mental trip? Why not simply just go out there and live your life? This is the nature of the fifth line. This position has special significance and there is no planet in detriment.\n\nVenus exalted. The gift in times of oppression to maintain, without hypocrisy, a harmonic relationship with one's oppressors, while providing aid and succor to the oppressed. These people are just fine; that is, it is going on in there and if you talk to them they'll say, \"Yes, I know. But it is just my mind.\"\n\nIn the white book: Realization at its most exalted. Acceptance of the weight of the abstract process and the grace that naturally follows. The abstract process is a painful process. It is its nature. The wave is from hope to pain. It is its nature. It is difficult. It is full of illusion. It is full of change and transitoriness. It always has its crisis. It is always going to be something that is uncomfortable, particularly at the mental level. The nature of the fifth line is that it is the universalization line: to show that, yes, oppression is there but this is not a bad thing. This is a process of remembering and trying to make sense out of what it is to be human. It ends up that people who carry this line can be very saintly. They can care very much for the pain of other humans and they can deal with that, and they can offer themselves in that because they do know it so well."

      "hd_title": "Futility",
      "full_text": "The ajna center, like the splenic center and like any awareness center, is a center of fear. In the mind, we call it anxiety. The fear of the 47th gate is the fear of not being able to realize, the fear of not being able to make sense out of life, the fear of not being able to relieve oneself of the oppression. When you come to the sixth line, all sixth lines carry with them the potential for depression. You are getting to the top of the house. You are on the roof and you looking out beyond, and what your hexagram represents is not what you are looking for. The 47.6, the next line is the 6.1, directly into the wave of the 6.1, directly into the line of not wasting your resources. This is a line of Futility. It is futile and it can be the most deeply depressive of all lines. Because it is on the mental plane, it can involve deep anxiety.\n\nFutility. A difficult position, for which there is no exaltation. The Sun in detriment, where the strength of will alone may find a way to adapt and survive, but without hope of ever overcoming the oppression. Here in the white book: Life as an ordeal stripped of realization. That means, from the mental plane and perspective, for these people, it is truly futile. Why bother to make sense out of that? What is the truth? The depression that lies in this sixth line, at this place, what it really wants is the truth. It does not just want something that makes sense because it knows that that does not work. It is futile. Something that makes sense today makes different sense tomorrow or no sense at all, and the sixth line knows that because it knows that it is just a wave. What it is really looking for is something beyond that. It is looking for the truth. What is the truth? What is it to be human?\n\nThe truth comes in the next line: Don't waste your resources on relationships that are not of value to you. That is its truth. Do not be open to things that are not of value to you. It is looking for its truth. These people know exactly that there is no use complaining. They realize that complaints are futile. They are very sensitive when they have other people around that constantly complain. They do not like that and, therefore, it is very important for them not to waste their resources on the wrong relationships."

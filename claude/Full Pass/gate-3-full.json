      "full_text": "The third hexagram is about the generation of life itself. It is about what literally brings us into the world. As such, the first line lays a foundation for what it is to be in the world. If you have the 3.1 and you are really introspective, the first thing that you know is that you are confused. What do you do about it? Nothing, because you know that, somewhere down the line, life will explain itself to you. If you have the first line and you don't know that you are confused, then you are really confused. You think you really know what is going on and everything breaks down in your face.\n\nThis is the nature of this first line. It speaks for our whole life process. Recognize that we all come into this life confused and we go through most of it confused. In most of those situations, if we are psychically healthy, the confusions in our life will be resolved naturally, as a way. That is what we are here for. We are great ordering creatures. We do manage to make sense out of things in the end, even if it is a lie. But the moment that you do not accept that confusion is natural, that the way is not your way to control, that is the moment that deep confusion comes in and the sense of, \"Where is the way?\""

      "hd_title": "Immaturity",
      "full_text": "When you get to the second line, you get to Immaturity. The first line spends all its time involved in the introspection of saying, \"I have confused energy,\" and the second line projects that out to everybody else. Everybody looks at the 3.2 and they say, \"Aren't they confused? They do not know where they are going.\" That brings all kinds of people who say, \"You shouldn't do that. You should do that.\" The 3.2 does not know its depth. The second line does not look inwards and it does not know that it is truly confused. It just puts out the confused, immature impression and then people come and say, \"You poor thing. Let me show you the way.\"\n\nThe 3rd gate is very confusing. The moment that you are confused and someone else shows you the way, you get even more confused because you are being shown the way by someone who is just as confused as you are. The unrestrained acceptance of guidance.\n\nThey do not know where they are going. They do not have the depth to understand that it is okay that you do not know where you are going. It is not up to you where you go. Our whole process is not about what we do. It is not ours to manipulate. This is a very deep dilemma, a very difficult thing to grasp, to understand that we are not the master controllers. We have this illusion that we have such control in our lives. We do not. All that is about conditioning. The truth is that life is meant to be lived out and it is meant to find its way. This is what we are all designed to do."

      "hd_title": "Survival",
      "full_text": "The third line is where the trial and error comes in. One thing to understand about going through this survival process is that, in order to survive confusion, you have to be willing to make those mistakes. You have to be ready to try different things because trial and error is built into it.\n\nAn innate contrariness which refuses to mutate. When Pluto comes to the 60th hexagram, we will have a whole generation of people who come and provide us with no new mutative material. This is a generation that will be a blind end when it comes to reproduction. It will have difficulties in reproduction.\n\nThe nature of the third line is that confusion is something that we can transcend through trial and error. All third lines have within them this ability to make mistakes and survive. That is the person that has four children with four different lovers and one of them is really great. It finally got it right. It got the genetic material it needed. \"Now I have the order that I really needed in my life. The other three, well...?\" By the way, politicians are born to the 3's. It is perfect for them."

      "line": 4,
      "hd_title": "Charisma",
      "full_text": "When you come to the fourth line, you come to another process. We move into the upper trigram. In the fourth line we are talking about something that is deeply aware of the fact that there is something else at the other end of the channel and that it no longer is involved in its own process but has an integrated process with other forces. This fourth line is called Charisma. Think about the channel of Charisma, the channel 20/34 in the integration network. If you see that in a chart where it is not connected to an awareness, you know that these are people that deeply need guidance in their life. The most charismatic people have, standing behind the curtain, someone who takes most of the money, most of the power, and does not do the front job which is done by the 20/34. Their charisma goes out in the world and the people in the back count all the money.\n\nBy its very nature, Charisma is about being guided. Everything about the 3rd hexagram is about living out the natural confusion of life. No matter what line you are dealing with, on one side is a way of living out that confusion to find what works and the other side is all about being even more confused by thinking that you can find a way out of the confusion, instead of just letting that natural process happen.\n\nInnate quality which attracts valued guidance. These people are focused on being confused. That is their charisma. After all, they have a one-track-mind. If you look at the 18.4, The Incompetent, you see that they are not capable themselves of solving the confusion because they are not designed to. They are designed to have someone else do it for them, legitimately. After all, they are looking to the other side of the channel. They literally are going to be guided. For these people, there is this sense that, the moment somebody comes along and says, \"I will take care of that for you,\" they just melt. The other extreme is that they are profoundly paranoid. They are always afraid that somebody is taking advantage of them because they do not know where they are going.\n\nOne of the terminologies that exist in the world that I am most uncomfortable with is this assumption and vanity that human beings have: the idea of having an individual karma. We do not. There will not be any mutation unless there is a whole chain of mutative forces that are at work.\n\nAt the highest level, once we go through the lower trigram process of saying, \"I am confused,\" we finally get to the upper trigram process that says, \"I am confused but, not only will there eventually be order, but I will find that order through others.\" In this sense, they are being guided. The worst scenario for these people is someone who has this line and a defined ego. \"I am confused, but so what? I will continue to be confused my way. You are not straightening me.\""

      "line": 5,
      "hd_title": "Victimization",
      "full_text": "The fifth line has this delicious name Victimization. Remember the nature of its resonance to the second line that projects out, \"I am confused.\" When you get to the fifth line, you have other people who project on the fifth line and say, \"That one is confused.\" The fifth line may or may not be confused. They may have already transcended the confusion and be totally in order. The other side is looking at them and says, \"Aha! They are confused. I am going to guide them and take advantage of them.\" The moment that the outside force is guiding the fifth line, the victimization is always possible.\n\nRemember, the fifth line is not necessarily confused. It just receives that projection. It is like a child that goes home to his parents as an adult and the parents are still seeing the child. They do not see the mature adult. It is not possible for them. The fifth line is always getting that kind of projection. They are always being seen as being confused, whether they are or not.\n\nAs an overview line it says: When actions designed to overcome confusion alienate others. \"I am not confused, let me show you.\" \"Yes, you are.\" That is confused. There is no way that they can convince the others that are projecting on them. \"Mom, I am no longer a child, I am a big boy now.\" \"Oh, no, you are still my baby.\" No way to escape that.\n\nMars exalted. The courage to stand by one's convictions. Very immature, to deny that projection to live out the nature. \"I am not victimized.\" Underneath that: The Earth in detriment, where victimization leads to appeasement and suffering. These people do not necessarily need to be guided. After all, they are there as a universalizing principle. It is one of the things that we see as a completing process in this hexagram, that so many 3rd gate people are victimized, that confusion gets victimized and projected on from the outside because people think that confusion is bad. Our logical process, which is very different from this individual process, says that order is something that we can establish: \"Here are the guidelines logically; being confused is not necessary. Come over here and I will show you how not to be confused.\"\n\nWhenever you look at the first and fifth lines you see the whole story. The first line tells you the deepest truth of what a hexagram is. The fifth line tells you how the world sees it. The world sees confusion as an opportunity for victimization. By the way, the positive attribute of that is what we call public education. \"Let's straighten all these people out. Let's show them the order. Teach them the ABC's. Teach them how to be good, moral, orderly creatures and make sure they do not cross the street against the light.\" We ingrain that in everybody as a result of this being the universalizing symbol of what it is to be confused. Confusion has a bad name."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Surrender",
      "full_text": "With the sixth line, you get to the roof. There you have a different movie because it is not really part of the hexagram anymore. It has all of that process inherent in it. It knows all of those steps. All of those things are there, even if it is not really in touch with them. They are built into the nature of the sixth line. It has a beautiful name: Surrender. We start with synthesis and end with surrender. This is the nature of what it is to live in a confusing body, in a confusing world. Surrender. It is not up to us to dictate the nature of the solution. Ordering comes of itself.\n\nPlease remember that the sacral center is not aware. It is a very hot and sweet, dumb machine. It is just doing its job. It is just putting out an energy force, an energy field. There is no awareness attached to that. In this energy itself lies this wonder of surrender. There is a genetic switch in us that says, okay, let it be. The ultimate maturity to recognize when struggle is futile. Don't fight. \"Why should I do anything about my confusion,\" says the sixth line. \"It is okay with me. Do you have a problem? I don't mind being confused. If you think that I am confused, it is okay with me.\"\n\nThe sixth line does not have to do anything. It is interested in the whole circuit and the whole individuality circuit is enormously complex. Its final stage is to bring about a viable mutation for all of humanity. That is not likely to happen every two or three seconds. There are so many people with this line who say, \"Why should I do anything about this confusion when I will have that confusion tomorrow. I am still confused. This is not solving anything for me. Let me just be confused. I do not want to mutate. I am not ready to mutate. I don't care about mutation unless I can really see that it is possible. Can it really happen? Otherwise I will stand back here and do nothing and vibrate with my sixth line.\"\n\nSun exalted. As its light sustains, so life goes on. This voice says, \"The sun is still shining. I will eventually find my order. I will not struggle in this life.\" I meet this all the time. I am very existential and I live with my awareness in the now and I am quite pleased to see that life just happens.\n\nWe had a client a couple of weeks ago in Munich. He had the 3.6 design Earth and he told us that, when he was 12 or 13 years old, he decided not to do anything for the rest of his life. He had a wealthy father and said, \"I am not going to struggle with this life. I will let it take care of me.\" That was his commitment to himself. And he never did anything. This was 50 years ago. He still lives off a trust fund from his father. He goes to school. This semester he goes to art school. Next semester, he goes to music school. He does whatever he wants. Somebody is always taking care of him and he does not have to struggle. The next step after the 3.6 is the 27.1. Think about that. It is the 3.6 that will really teach you what nourishment is. They teach you what it is to be caring. The moment that you have this capacity to be able to live out your nature no matter what it is - the moment that you realize that this is okay - you become caring and nourishing to others.\n\nThe joke is that this man has seven children. He married three different women and each one of his wives took care of him, and so did each one of his seven children. They could have been horrified, as their mother was, but they all became something special in their lives, each and every one of them, because he gave them a gift. He showed them that he was there for them but he did not ever force them. That was his surrender. He did not ever push them. He was there and he gave them caring and love in a very special way. They were a healthy family with an absent, irresponsible father in terms of the mundane, and one who was a beautiful influence in these children's lives.\n\nPluto in detriment. The tendency when defeated to blame the victor rather than acknowledge one's limitations. In the white book: Confusion that impedes accepting one's limitations in order to transcend. The joke is not to struggle to find order. It will come. It will be revealed or not revealed. Do not victimize yourself by trying to find it out because you will end up never finding it. Don't think that by just saying, \"I give up,\" by making that statement, that this will resolve your confusion. It will not. In time, as you mature, you will find a way. We all do."

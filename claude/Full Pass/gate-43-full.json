      "hd_title": "Patience",
      "full_text": "The introspection here is called Patience. Pluto exalted. The recognition that new forms (new knowing) can not be established until resistance has been eliminated. \"Is it really a knowing? Do I really know it?\" This is the examination of the knowing.\n\nVenus in detriment. An impatience to enjoy the sweets of accomplishment that inevitably leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Knowers get attention with their \"I know\". If they don't go through the introspection, they can end up in a lot., difficulty.\n\nThe depth necessary to bring into form an individual insight. That is to really know what you know. To know your knowing,, you have to go into it.\n\nOn the other side of this: A delight in the insight but a lack of depth to establish it. Suddenly, there is this sense of \"Ah, I know,\" but can you really explain that to somebody else? The detriment side knows that it can't. It gets up on \"Oh, I know\" and what happens to these people is that when they meet another individual who says exactly the same thing, they look at them and say \"I know\" and they feel good because they themselves have great difficulty in getting that out.\n\nIt is the first line that demonstrates the nature of the hexagram. That sudden awareness is something that either leads to the demands of depth, to go into it deeply, know your knowing, or it comes out on the other side where there is no ability to express it. So many knowers cannot express their knowing."

      "hd_title": "Dedication",
      "full_text": "These people talk out loud. They do not know if anybody listens to them. They are the kind of people walking around the house and, all of a sudden, you hear them. \"Oh, I knowl\" And you wonder who they are talking to. It simply comes of the projection.\n\nThis line is called Dedication. Pluto exalted. The maintenance of specialized attitudes which promote breakthrough. These people can have linguistic tics, for example, repeating things out loud again and again. \"The sky is blue. The sky is blue... I know.\" That is their way of going through their knowing. When they are learning something, they may have a very specialized out-loud-technique for learning that drives other people crazy. That may seem weird to other people but that is their process on getting it through.\n\nUnique mental habits and thought processes which promote insight. I guarantee that, for much of history, these people were considered mad because, all of a sudden, they blurt things out and you wonder whether they are possessed by the devil. This is a freak channel. People who have the 43.2 are easily possessed, in that sense. They can feel possessed.\n\nThe other side has Moon in detriment. A dedication to action that, when actualization is in sight, may become incautious. In most cases, that is what happens because the 23 is already available at the other end. So, they can automatically just blurt out whatever that knowing is in the moment, which can seem absurd to somebody else. That is not to say that it cannot be of enormous value as well. Do not misunderstand that.\n\nThe urge for expression that will abandon its normal processes when an opportunity arises. There is a wonderful description of a surgeon in a book written by Oliver Sacks, who has Tourette's syndrome and he has hand and foot tics. There is this wonderful scene of him in the infirmary room with the other surgeons, just before he has to do an operation. He is lying on. the floor and he has his feet up on somebody and his hands are going all around, and he is repeating \"I know, I know,\" and then he goes into the operating room and it is gone. He is a great surgeon and people love him.\n\nAll the funny stuff that the 43.2 can do, given the right circumstances, instantaneously, that is gone and the other side of them can come out and they can seem quite normal, just to protect themselves, because they are freaks anyway. (By the way, this doctor flew an airplane.)\n\nThe physical tics of that are related to the emotional system, and the acoustic tics are related to the mind. One of the gifts that lie in acoustic tics, that is in this unusual way the mind works, is the repetition of sounds which leads to excellent language skills. You have to recognize about the 43/23 that the 43, when it hears a sound, is trying to figure out how to translate it in order to figure out how to explain it. It is not turning the picture into a word; it is turning the inner sound into an outer sound. There are a great many language skills that are involved in this. You have a lot of mimics here as well."

      "hd_title": "Expediency",
      "full_text": "We come to the end of the upper trigram. We come to bonds made and broken and the theme of irresponsibility. It is called Expediency. The third line has the potential in it to be both introspective and projective, and it is looking to the other side for the first time. But again, we have to keep in mind that, in most cases, 43's have the 23 on the other side.\n\nPluto exalted. The powerful drive for regeneration that will, when breakthrough (their knowing) is threatened, use any means, align with any force and endure any condemnation to achieve the goal. I knew this very well. It is my South Node line.\n\nMoon i n detriment. An oversensitiviy to condemnation that may preclude justified expediency and result in failure. The nature of this third line is to get one's knowing out no matter what, which of course can be very dangerous. If you do not know what you are talking about, you will be in a lot of trouble.\n\nA certainly in knowing that can withstand condemnation. I know this so well in respectltb Human Design. What I '(now about the nature of my experience with the Voice and the information that I was given, it did not matter how many people told me that I was crazy. It made no difference to me. I did not listen to them. My knowing was very clear. The capacity to withstand condemnation.\n\nOn the other side: Individual insight abandoned in the face of condemnation. The teal dilemma of the knower is whether or not you will be able to live with your own knowing. For a great many people, this is a constant dilemma: \"Can I continue to project my knowing out and put up with having all these people say, 'You are wrong.'?\" This is something every knower goes through. My first reaction after my experience with the voice was \"Oh, no, do I really have to do this? Do I have to put up with all these people saying 'Oh, no.'?\" You align with any force."

      "hd_title": "The One-track mind",
      "full_text": "Here, we get to externalization and you get to the line that gives its name to what I am describing to you as a theme, this One-track mind. These people can drive you mad. Knowing is something that is very difficult to get across to everybody else. These people are fixed on one knowing, whatever that knowing happens to be. They are incredibly persistent in that knowing.\n\nMercury exalted. The over-reliance and stubborn obsession with one's mental abilities in the face of recurring obstacles. This design, given Mercurial mental gifts may, though rarely, succeed. Jupiter in detriment. A belief in inherent right action based on limited knowledge that shuns advice. \"I know, and you don't.\" Even if somebody is standing there telling them very calmly and clearly that they are wrong and explains to them why 1 and 1 equals 2 and not 76, they still insist on their \"I know.\" Their knowing can be extremely stubborn. They are really fixed in their knowing.\n\nA stubborn reliance on one's unique insights that demands focused mental ability to be properly conceptualized. They may be of enormous value and they may be Galileo's that are shunned all of their lives and may have real brilliance within them, or they can just be rockers (as 'in racking one's brains'), which is the other side of the coin. You get everything in that spectrum. This is the key to people that have this line. \"Okay, you are fixed on this knowing, so get it very clear so that other people can grasp it. If you cannot explain it, you will be shunned, and if you are fixed on it, you appear to be an obsessive. You have to be able to explain it.\"\n\nThe other side is: The vanity to attempt expression without depth. These are people that know the moment they come into the world. If they could speak, they would tell their mothers that they are doing a lousy job. \"I know what you should do with me.\" They will claim that authority the moment they come into the world."

      "hd_title": "Progression",
      "full_text": "We reach the point within the hexagram where the process is complete. You get to Progression. This a fascinating line because the emphasis of this line is about understanding the nature of the other. The fifth line already recognizes its knowing when it is there. It has its knowing, but its greatest concern is not about what it knows but whether it is able to get its knowing across to the other side. The only way these people can do that is when they have a deep understanding of the other, so that they are able to recognize when and with whom they can get their knowing out. This is the whole thing about the knower. That is why you have the 12/22 as a social channel for the individual, this capacity to recognize within the mood when it is the right timing, when is it a good time to go out as an individual and to offer your knowing and explanation.\n\nMoon exalted. The step by step adaptation to relationships which hinders breakthrough through practical actions that will not jeopardize eventual success. \"First, let me seduce them and, if I succeed in seducing them, then I will give them my knowing because then it will be easier because then they are already ready to accept me rather than treating me as a freak. I can't just throw my knowing at them. I am not the second line.\"\n\nVenus in detriment. A tendency to concentrate on harmonizing relationships that tends to strengthen the position of restrictive forces rather than benefiting breakthrough. You seduce them and become their friend. You finally tell them your knowing and they tell you, \"Yes, yes, I know you. That does not work.\" This is very difficult. What happens to the fifth line is that they are very concerned about what people think about them. The fifth line is afraid of being burned at the stake. They recognize that their knowing can always be dangerous for them unless they can have a good relationship with the people. That is the key in their process.\n\nThe gift of knowing when a unique insight can be shared effectively with others. The other side of this: An over-reliance on the receptivity of others that turns harmony into the conditioner of individual expression. \"I won't say what I really know because I will lose them as my friend.\" This can be deeply frustrating for the knower. I recommend to people with this line: their dilemma is no longer whether they can explain themselves or not. Their dilemma is: do they really understand people? Unless they understand people, they will have difficulty in getting their knowing across."

      "line": 6,
      "hd_title": "Breakthrough",
      "full_text": "Here we have the line of transition. This line is about mutation. Once you get to the end of the process in the 43rd gate, the sixth line is no longer interested in the knowing itself, but whether the knowing is mutative. Only when it is mutative, it is really something. It is looking for that One night stand, the Blaze of glory, whatever you want to call it. It is looking for something that is beyond the knowing. It is the capacity to recognize that the individual process can always be mutative, and it is looking for the mutative potential. This line goes through an enormous transformation when knowing occurs.\n\nBreakthrough. Sun exalted. Actualization and centering, that in breakthrough naturally establish both internally and externally a new order. Everything gets wiped out in that. The moment that the new knowing is there, the only thing that is interesting is that, in this kind of mind, it is already mutative. It will erase all kinds of things. It will be the knowing that this mind is focused on, not focused in terms of explaining it, but waiting for the mutation to take hold. It is always about looking to see where the mutation can be.\n\nOn the Martian side: An ego tendency that in breakthrough sees justification of its lesser attributes and carries them over into the new order.\n\nIn the white book, you have: Unique knowing that is both personally and collectively of value. It is of value, but these people won't tell you their knowing because they are only interested in mutation. I know this so well. I have people who come up to me after a lecture or a course and they say to me, \"This is so interesting.\" That does not mean anything to me. If somebody is saying to a 43.6, \"Your knowing is interesting,\" they will look at you \"Oh, my god. Keep these people away from me.\" The 43.6 says to itself, \"Of course it is interesting, you fool. It is knowing.\" It is something that is there to be mutative. The 43.6 people have a sense of aloofness (44.6) in that: \"The knowing is not for you because you will not mutate with this knowing.\"\n\nThe other side is: Where the value of knowing is more important than other aspects of life. This is where this line can be weird. This is the mad scientist who is so absorbed in his knowing that they forget to wash or eat or sleep. They forget the world outside, their children and their family. They are gone in their knowing and can be very deluded in that, hoping for the possibility of mutation to come along."

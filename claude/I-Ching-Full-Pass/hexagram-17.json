There will (then) be no error.\n\n1. The first line, undivided, shows us one changing the object of his pursuit; but if he be firm and correct, there will be good fortune. Going beyond (his own) gate to find associates, he will achieve merit.\n\n2. The second line, divided, shows us one who cleaves to the little boy, and lets go the man of age and experience.\n\n3. The third line, divided, shows us one who cleaves to the man of age and experience, and lets go the little boy. Such following will get what it seeks; but it will be advantageous to adhere to what is firm and correct.\n\n4. The fourth line, undivided, shows us one followed and obtaining (adherents). Though he be firm and correct, there will be evil. If he be sincere (however) in his course, and make that evident, into what error will he fall?\n\n5. The fifth line, undivided, shows us (the ruler) sincere in (fostering all) that is excellent. There will be good fortune.\n\n6. The topmost line, divided, shows us (that sincerity) firmly held and clung to, yea, and bound fast. (We see) the king with it presenting his offerings on the western mountain.",

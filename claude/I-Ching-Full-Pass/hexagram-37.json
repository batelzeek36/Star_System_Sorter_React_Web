The Kià Zän Hexagram.\n\nFor (the realisation of what is taught in) Kià Zän, (or for the regulation of the family), what is most advantageous is that the wife be firm and correct.\n\n1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject establishing restrictive regulations in his household. Occasion for repentance will disappear.\n\n2. The second line, divided, shows its subject taking nothing on herself, but in her central place attending to the preparation of the food. Through her firm correctness there will be good fortune.\n\n3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject (treating) the members of the household with stern severity. There will be occasion for repentance, there will be peril, (but) there will (also) be good fortune. If the wife and children were to be smirking and chattering, in the end there would be occasion for regret.\n\n4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject enriching the family. There will be great good fortune.\n\n5. The fifth line, undivided, shows the influence of the king extending to his family. There need be no anxiety; there will be good fortune.\n\n6. The topmost line, undivided, shows its subject possessed of sincerity and arrayed in majesty. In the end there will be good fortune.",

But the advantage will come from being firm and correct; and movement in any direction whatever will be advantageous.\n\n1. The first line, divided, shows its subject deeply (desirous) of long continuance. Even with firm correctness there will be evil; there will be no advantage in any way.\n\n2. The second line, undivided, shows all occasion for repentance disappearing.\n\n3. The third line, undivided, shows one who does not continuously maintain his virtue. There are those who will impute this to him as a disgrace. However firm he may be, there will be ground for regret.\n\n4. The fourth line, undivided, shows a field where there is no game.\n\n5. The fifth line, divided, shows its subject continuously maintaining the virtue indicated by it. In a wife this will be fortunate; in a husband, evil.\n\n6. The topmost line, divided, shows its subject exciting himself to long continuance. There will be evil.",

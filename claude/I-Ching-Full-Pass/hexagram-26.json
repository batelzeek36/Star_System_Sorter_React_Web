(If its subject do not seek to) enjoy his revenues in his own family (without taking service at court), there will be good fortune. It will be advantageous for him to cross the great stream.\n\n1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject in a position of peril. It will be advantageous for him to stop his advance.\n\n2. The second line, undivided, shows a carriage with the strap under it removed.\n\n3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject urging his way with good horses. It will be advantageous for him to realise the difficulty (of his course), and to be firm and correct, exercising himself daily in his charioteering and methods of defence; then there will be advantage in whatever direction he may advance.\n\n4. The fourth line, divided, shows the young bull, (and yet) having the piece of wood over his horns. There will be great good fortune.\n\n5. The fifth line, divided, shows the teeth of a castrated hog.

'He is in a position of peril; it will be advantageous for him to stop his advance;'—he should not rashly expose himself to calamity.\n\n2. '(He is as) a carriage from which the strap under it has been removed:'—being in the central position, he will incur no blame.\n\n3. 'There will be advantage in whatever direction he may advance:'—(the subject of) the topmost line is of the same mind with him.\n\n4. 'The great good fortune indicated by the fourth line, divided,' shows that there is occasion for joy.\n\n5. 'The good fortune indicated by the fifth line, divided, shows that there is occasion for congratulation.\n\n6. 'In command of the firmament of heaven:'—the way is grandly open for movement.",

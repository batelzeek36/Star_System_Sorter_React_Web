It will be advantageous (also) to meet with the great man. (In these circumstances), with firmness and correctness, there will be good fortune.\n\n1. From the first line, divided, we learn that advance (on the part of its subject) will lead to (greater) difficulties, while remaining stationary will afford ground for praise.\n\n2. The second line, divided, shows the minister of the king struggling with difficulty on difficulty, and not with a view to his own advantage.\n\n3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject advancing, (but only) to (greater) difficulties. He remains stationary, and returns (to his former associates).\n\n4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject advancing, (but only) to (greater) difficulties. He remains stationary, and unites (with the subject of the line above).\n\n5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject struggling with the greatest difficulties, while friends are coming to help him.\n\n6. The topmost line, divided, shows its subject going forward, (only to increase) the difficulties, while his remaining stationary will be (productive of) great (merit).

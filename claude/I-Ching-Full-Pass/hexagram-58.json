    "text": "LVIII. The trigram Tui symbolises water as collected in a marsh or lake; and its attribute or virtus is pleasure or complacent satisfaction. It is a matter of some difficulty to determine in one's mind how this attribute came to be connected with the trigram. The Khang-hsi editors say—'When the airs of spring begin to blow, from the collections of water on the earth the moistening vapours rise up (and descend again); so, when the breath of health is vigorous in a man's person, the hue of it is displayed in his complexion. Akin to this is the significance of the hexagram Tui representing a marsh, as denoting pleasure. Although the yin lines give it its special character they owe their power and effect to the yang; so when the qualities of mildness and harmony prevail in a man, without true-heartedness and integrity to control and direct them, they will fail to be correct, and may degenerate into what is evil. Hence it is said that it will be advantageous to be firm and correct!'\n\nThe feeling then of pleasure is the subject of this hexagram. The above quotation sufficiently explains the concluding characters of the Thwan; but where is the intimation in Tui of progress and attainments? It is supposed to be in the one weak line surmounting each trigram and supported by the two strong lines. Fancy sees in that mildness and benignity energised by a double portion of strength.\n\nLine 1, strong in the place of strength, with no proper correlate above, is thus confined to itself. But its subject is sufficient for himself, and, though he has no place in the world of affairs, he can enjoy himself with the internal consciousness of being what he ought to be.\n\nLine 2, though strong, is in the place of a weak line. This is supposed to temper the strength of its subject; and in his supremacy of satisfaction he forgets himself. No one will mind him.\n\nIt is only a weak line that will be proper in 3. The subject of it, occupied only with the thought of pleasure, and careless of what is right, will not escape the evil consequences of error.\n\nLine 4 is strong, but in the place of a weak line. Hence its subject will be in perplexity. Away from pleasure and towards what is right, how can he be happy?\n\nLine 5 is strong, and in its correct place. It might be expected to be happy; but its correlate is the weak 2, with its subject too much given to pleasure to help the ruler in his difficulties. Hence the line is said to be 'in danger.'\n\nThe limit of pleasure has been reached by the subject of 6; and he is in danger of losing himself. This would be evil, and only leading and attracting others to pleasure can prevent this danger being realised."

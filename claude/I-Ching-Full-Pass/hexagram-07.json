The second line, undivided, shows (the leader) in the midst of the host. There will be good fortune and no error. The king has thrice conveyed to him the orders (of his favour).\n\n3. The third line, divided, shows how the host may, possibly, have many inefficient leaders. There will be evil.\n\n4. The fourth line, divided, shows the host in retreat. There is no error.\n\n5. The fifth line, divided, shows birds in the fields, which it will be advantageous to seize (and destroy). In that case there will be no error.

With firmness there will be good fortune; and it will be advantageous to cross the great stream.\n\n1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject waiting in the distant border. It will be well for him constantly to maintain (the purpose thus shown), in which case there will be no error.\n\n2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject waiting on the sand (of the mountain stream). He will (suffer) the small (injury of) being spoken (against), but in the end there will be good fortune.\n\n3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject in the mud (close by the stream). He thereby invites the approach of injury.\n\n4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject waiting in (the place of) blood. But he will get out of the cavern.\n\n5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject waiting amidst the appliances of a feast. Through his firmness and correctness there will be good fortune.\n\n6.

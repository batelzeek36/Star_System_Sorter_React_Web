## Line Archetype Quick Reference

| Line | Archetype | Key Themes | Common Mistakes to Avoid |
|------|-----------|------------|--------------------------|
| **1** | Foundation/Investigator | Introspection, research, insecurity without solid base | ❌ Saying they project (that's line 5) |
| **2** | Hermit/Natural | Natural talent, **called out by others**, projection FROM others | ❌ "Projects answers outward" (that's line 5) |
| **3** | Martyr/Experimenter | **Trial-and-error**, experimentation, learning through mistakes | ❌ Not using "trial-and-error" explicitly |
| **4** | Opportunist/Externalizer | Network, friendship, **says yes first then figures it out** | ❌ Harsh "liar" language (use "role-playing to learn") |
| **5** | Heretic/Projection Field | **Others project ONTO them**, seduction, practical solutions, reputation | ❌ Not mentioning "projection field" |
| **6** | Role Model | Three phases (trial/roof/model), objectivity, wisdom over time | ❌ Using "punishment" (use "consequences") |

## Center Quick Reference

| Center | Gates | Key Themes | Language to Use | Language to Avoid |
|--------|-------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **G** | 1, 2, 7, 10, 13, 15, 25, 46 | Identity, direction, love | "Identity", "direction", "self" | "Work", "productivity" |
| **Ajna** | 4, 11, 17, 24, 43, 47 | Mental conceptualizing, formulas | "Mental", "conceptual", "formulas" | "Instinctive", "intuitive" |
| **Spleen** | 18, 28, 32, 44, 48, 50, 57 | Instinctive, in-the-moment awareness | "Instinctive", "intuitive", "survival" | "Mental", "thinking" |
| **Root** | 19, 39, 41, 52, 53, 54, 58, 60 | Pressure, stress, drive | "Pressure", "drive", "stress" | "Relaxed", "easy" |
| **Sacral** | 3, 5, 9, 14, 27, 29, 34, 42, 59 | Life force, response, work capacity | "Response", "life force", "work" | "Initiation" (that's Manifestor) |

## Circuit Quick Reference

| Circuit | Key Gates | Key Themes | Must Include |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **Individual** | 1, 2, 7, 10, 13, 25, 27, 28, 29, 33, 43, 44, 46, 49, 51, 55, 59 | Mutation, melancholy, pulse, can't be forced | "Melancholy", "mutation", "pulse" |
| **Logic** | 4, 11, 17, 23, 24, 43, 47, 62, 63 | Mental formulas, patterns, understanding | "Formulas", "patterns", "understanding" |

## Language Refinement Quick Hits

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| "Isolation" | "Auric boundaries", "non-interference" | Less heavy, more precise |
| "Punishment" | "Consequences" | Less moralistic |
| "Lying" (4th line) | "Role-playing to learn", "externalization" | Unless Ra explicitly says "liar" |
| "Waiting" (Individual gates) | "Creative timing", "pulse" | Waiting is Type strategy, not gate theme |
| "Instinctive" (Ajna gates) | "Mental", "conceptual" | Ajna is mental, Spleen is instinctive |
| "Work" (G Center gates) | "Identity", "direction", "love" | G is not about work |
| Generic 5th line | "Projection field", "seduction", "reputation" | 5th line receives projections |
| Generic 2nd line | "Called out", "natural talent", "hermit" | 2nd line doesn't project outward |

## Critical Distinctions

### 2nd Line vs 5th Line Projection

**2nd Line (Hermit/Natural):**
- Others project ONTO them
- They get CALLED OUT
- Natural talent, don't need to teach
- Withdraw when not recognized

**5th Line (Projection Field):**
- Others project expectations ONTO them (savior/heretic)
- Must deliver PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS
- Seduces energy to test formulas
- Reputation at stake

**Key difference:** Both receive projections, but 5th line must deliver practical solutions and carries reputation burden. 2nd line just wants to be left alone unless properly recognized.

---

### Individual Circuit vs Type Strategy

**Individual Circuit Gates (1, 2, 7, 10, 13, 25, 27, 28, 29, 33, 43, 44, 46, 49, 51, 55, 59):**
- Theme: **Creative timing, mutation, melancholy, pulse**
- Energy: Can't be forced or scheduled
- Language: "Creative timing", "pulse", "melancholy as fuel"

**Type Strategy (Manifestor/Generator/Projector/Reflector):**
- Manifestor: Initiates, informs
- Generator: Responds, waits for response
- Projector: Waits for invitation
- Reflector: Waits lunar cycle

**Key difference:** Individual gates have CREATIVE TIMING (can't force inspiration). Type strategy is about HOW you engage with the world. Don't confuse "waiting for creative pulse" with "waiting for invitation" (Projector strategy).

---

### Ajna vs Spleen

**Ajna Center (Mental):**
- Gates: 4, 11, 17, 24, 43, 47
- Theme: Mental conceptualizing, formulas, patterns
- Language: "Mental pressure", "formulas", "understanding"
- NOT: "Instinctive", "intuitive"

**Spleen Center (Instinctive):**
- Gates: 18, 28, 32, 44, 48, 50, 57
- Theme: Instinctive, in-the-moment awareness, survival
- Language: "Instinctive knowing", "intuitive", "survival"
- NOT: "Mental", "thinking", "conceptual"

**Key difference:** Ajna is HEAD (mental processing). Spleen is BODY (instinctive knowing). Gate 4 is Ajna, so use "mental recognition" not "instinctive timing."

## Pre-Submission Checklist

Before submitting any gate extraction, verify:

- [ ] Checked gate's CENTER in quick reference
- [ ] Checked gate's CIRCUIT in quick reference
- [ ] Applied circuit-specific keywords (Individual=melancholy, Logic=formulas, etc.)
- [ ] Line 2: Used "called out", "natural talent", NOT "projects outward"
- [ ] Line 3: Used "trial-and-error" explicitly
- [ ] Line 4: Used "externalization", "role-playing to learn", NOT harsh "liar"
- [ ] Line 5: Used "projection field", "seduction", "reputation"
- [ ] Line 6: Used "consequences" NOT "punishment", mentioned three life phases
- [ ] Ajna gates: Used "mental" NOT "instinctive"
- [ ] G Center gates: Avoided "work" framing
- [ ] Individual gates: Included "melancholy", "mutation", or "pulse"
- [ ] All quotes are VERBATIM from Line Companion
- [ ] All axes use concrete action verbs, not abstract awareness verbs

## When in Doubt

1. **Check the center** - this tells you the TYPE of energy (mental, instinctive, identity, etc.)
2. **Check the circuit** - this tells you the THEME (mutation, formulas, bargains, sharing)
3. **Check the line archetype** - this tells you the INTERPERSONAL DYNAMIC
4. **Use concrete action verbs** - what does this person DO, not what they "recognize" or "understand"
5. **Keep it grounded** - avoid mystical language, use behavioral descriptions

---

## Example: Gate 4 Line 2 (Before vs After)

### ❌ Before (Missing Mechanics)
```json
{
  "keywords": ["tolerance", "projection", "patience with others"],
  "behavioral_axis": "Projects answers outward and accepts that not everyone can understand",
  "shadow_axis": "Takes advantage of others' lack of understanding"
}
```

**Problems:**
- Line 2 doesn't project outward (that's line 5)
- Missing Ajna/Logic circuit context
- "Projection" keyword is misleading

### ✅ After (Mechanical Precision)
```json
{
  "keywords": ["tolerance", "natural understanding", "called out", "hermit"],
  "behavioral_axis": "Naturally embodies mental formulas without needing to teach, accepting that not everyone has the same capacity for understanding and developing tolerance",
  "shadow_axis": "Takes advantage of others' lack of understanding, withholding knowledge and operating from ego assertion at others' expense"
}
```

**Improvements:**
- Line 2 archetype correct (hermit/natural, called out)
- Ajna context included ("mental formulas")
- Keywords reflect hermit dynamic, not projection
- Behavioral axis shows natural embodiment, not active projection

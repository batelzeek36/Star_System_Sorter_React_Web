# Stream Scripts & Talking Points

## Stream 1A: "The Vision & Demo"

**Duration**: 45 minutes (MAX)  
**Goal**: Hook people with the experience, not overwhelm with details

### Why Split Stream 1?

People rarely stay for 90+ minutes unless they're already converted. This stream is for discovery, not deep dives. Keep it tight, keep it magical, leave them wanting more.

---

### Opening (3 min)

"Hey everyone, thanks for being here. I've been working on something for [X months] that I haven't shown anyone yet.

Quick context: I'm into Human Design and mythology. And I kept noticing HD felt incomplete - it tells you your type and gates, but not *why* you're wired that way.

That question turned into 1,200 hours of research. And then I built an app.

Today: I'm showing you what I built. 45 minutes. Let's go."

### Demo (15 min)

**Screen share the app (not the code)**

"This is Star System Sorter. You put in your birth data, it pulls your HD chart, classifies you into one of 8 star systems.

Not 'you're literally from Pleiades' - more 'your behavioral pattern aligns with the Pleiadian archetype.'

Let me run my own chart..."

[Walk through the 4-screen flow - FAST]

"Birth data... fetching HD chart... running classification...

Okay. Primary: [your result]. Secondary: [ally].

[Read ONE key excerpt from narrative]

That's... uncomfortably accurate.

This isn't generic astrology. Every gate.line researched from primary sources. Let me show you why that matters..."

### Research Teaser (10 min)

**Screen share your file structure (collapsed folders only) + physical books**

"This is the research layer.

[Pan across folders - DON'T OPEN THEM]

- 64 I Ching hexagrams (Wilhelm + Legge translations)
- 64 Human Design gates
- 384 gate.line combinations - each researched individually

Not AI-generated. Not blog posts. Primary sources.

[Hold up physical book]

Wilhelm I Ching, 1950. The gold standard. Every gate.line traces back to this.

Cross-referenced with Egyptian texts, Kabbalah, Vedic sources.

1,200 hours. 384 mappings. ISBNs and page numbers.

That's why it's accurate."

### The Ask (7 min)

"I can't finish this alone.

I need:
- **Developers** - scale this to production
- **Researchers** - verify my work, fill gaps
- **Beta testers** - tell me if this resonates
- **Mythology nerds** - expand the research

What I offer:
- Beta testers: free lifetime access
- Contributors: GitHub credit + profit-sharing
- Core team: equity + co-founder title

What I can't offer:
- The mappings (proprietary)
- The algorithm details (that's the moat)
- A guarantee this makes money

But if you're excited about mythology + tech, about treating ancient texts like data, about building something unprecedented...

Join the Discord. Link in chat."

### Q&A (10 min - STRICT TIMER)

**Anticipated questions:**

**Q: "How does the classification work?"**
A: "I can't reveal the exact algorithm, but here's the high level: it looks at your gate.line placements - both personality and design - and compares them to 384 mappings I've researched. Each gate.line has a weight and an alignment type (core or shadow) for each star system. The algorithm aggregates those weights with calibrated sparsify and sharpen settings, then gives you percentages. It's deterministic - same birth data always produces the same result. That's why it's accurate."

**Q: "Is this open source?"**
A: "The frontend and non-sensitive backend will be, eventually. The classification logic and research mappings are proprietary - that's my competitive moat. But I'm open to collaboration with the right people."

**Q: "Can I get a reading?"**
A: "Not live right now - I need to protect people's privacy. But if you want to DM me your birth data, I can run it offline and send you the results. Or join the Discord and apply to be a beta tester."

**Q: "What's the business model?"**
A: "TBD. Probably freemium - basic readings free, premium features paid. Maybe API access for developers. Maybe Patreon for supporters. I'm open to ideas."

**Q: "How accurate is it?"**
A: "Very accurate. I've tested it on myself and dozens of people, and the feedback has been 'holy shit, how did you know that?' The accuracy comes from 1,200+ hours of meticulous research - every gate.line manually scored against all 8 star systems. It's not AI guessing or algorithmic generation. It's deterministic and reproducible. Same birth data = same result, every time."

### Closing (2 min)

"That's 45 minutes. Thank you for being here.

Next steps:
- Discord link in chat - join now
- Next stream: Live readings (date TBD)
- Follow for updates

This is just the beginning. 🌌"

Next stream: Live readings. Bring your birth data. 🌌"

---

## Stream 2: "Live Readings"

**Duration**: 90-120 minutes  
**Goal**: Show the app in action, build community, collect feedback

### Format

- Take 5-8 volunteers from chat
- Run their charts through the app (screen share results only, not their raw data)
- React to results together
- Ask for their feedback on accuracy

### Script Template (Per Reading)

"Okay, next up is [username]. I've got your birth data in the system...

[Run the classification]

Alright, so you're coming up as [primary system] with [secondary system] as your ally. Let me read this narrative...

[Read key excerpts]

Does that resonate? What's landing for you? What feels off?

[Listen to their response]

Interesting. So the thing about [their system] is [explain the archetype briefly]. And your secondary [ally system] adds [explain the dynamic].

Looking at your chart, you've got [mention a specific gate.line placement] which is very [system]-coded. That's probably why you're getting such a strong signal there.

[Ask follow-up questions about their life/behavior to validate]

Cool. Thank you for being a guinea pig. This is super helpful."

### Closing

"Alright, that's all the time we have for readings today. Thank you to everyone who volunteered - you're helping me refine this.

If you didn't get a reading today, join the Discord and I'll do more sessions soon.

Next stream: I'm going to do a tech deep dive - show you the architecture, the testing setup, maybe some live coding. If you're a dev, you'll want to be there."

## Talking Points (General)

### When People Ask "How Does It Work?"

"The short version: I researched 384 gate.line combinations from primary sources - the I Ching, Egyptian texts, Kabbalistic literature. Each gate.line has a behavioral signature. I mapped those signatures to 8 star system archetypes. Then I built an algorithm that looks at your HD chart and calculates which star system(s) you align with. The exact mappings are proprietary, but the results speak for themselves."

### When People Ask "Is This Real?"

"The research is real - 1,200+ hours, primary sources with ISBNs and page numbers, full provenance tracking. The algorithm is real - deterministic, calibrated, reproducible. The accuracy is real - people consistently report 'how did you know that?' The foundation is real - the I Ching has 3,000 years of scholarship, Human Design maps to 64 DNA codons. This isn't pseudoscience or vibes - it's computational mythology with academic rigor. Whether it resonates for you personally is something only you can decide, but the work is legitimate."

### When People Ask "Can I Copy This?"

"You can try, but you'd need to replicate 1,200 hours of research. The UI is just React components - that's easy. The hard part is the mappings and the calibration. I researched 384 gate.line combinations individually, scored each one against all 8 star systems, cross-referenced multiple sources, tracked provenance, validated claims, then calibrated the algorithm with sparsify/sharpen settings to maximize accuracy. That's the moat. If you want to build something similar, go for it - but you'll be starting from scratch and you won't get the same accuracy without doing the work. Or you could just collaborate with me and we'll build it together."

### When People Ask "What's Your Credibility?"

"I'm not a PhD or a certified Human Design analyst. I'm a researcher-builder who got obsessed with a question and spent 1,200 hours answering it. My credibility comes from the work: the sources I used (Wilhelm, Legge, Faulkner - real translators with real credentials), the methodology I followed (≥2 sources per claim, full citations, dispute tracking), and the results people are getting (read the testimonials). If you want to verify my work, join the Discord and I'll show you the bibliography. If you want to challenge my interpretations, bring your sources and let's debate. I'm here to learn, not to be right."

3. **Never promise medical/psychological outcomes** - Legal liability
4. **Never bash other systems** - Stay collaborative, not competitive
5. **Never reveal user data** - Privacy is sacred
6. **Never claim scientific proof** - Frame as research, not science
7. **Never give away the methodology** - Show results, not recipes

---

## Your Voice (Stay In This Energy)

- **Curious, not certain**: "I think I've found something, but I need your help to verify it"
- **Rigorous, not rigid**: "I care about sources, but I'm open to being wrong"
- **Collaborative, not competitive**: "Let's build this together, not fight over who's right"
- **Passionate, not preachy**: "This excites me, and I hope it excites you too"
- **Humble, not self-deprecating**: "I've done the work, but I'm not the expert - the sources are"

You're not a guru. You're a researcher-builder who got obsessed and made something cool. Stay there.

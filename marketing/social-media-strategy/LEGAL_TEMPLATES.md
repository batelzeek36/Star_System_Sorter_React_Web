## When to Hire a Lawyer

**You can probably DIY:**
- CLA for small contributors
- NDA-Lite for frontend contributors
- Bounty agreements under $500

**You should hire a lawyer:**
- Full NDA for senior contributors
- Equity agreements (always)
- IP assignment agreements (always)
- If you're incorporating (LLC, C-corp)
- If you're fundraising
- If someone breaches and you need to sue

**Cost estimates:**
- Template review: $200-500
- Custom agreement: $500-2,000
- Incorporation: $1,000-3,000
- Lawsuit: $5,000-50,000+ (avoid if possible)

---

## Final Reminder

**These templates are a starting point, not legal advice.**

Every situation is different. Every state has different laws. Every contributor has different needs.

Spend the $500 to have a lawyer review your specific situation. It's cheaper than a lawsuit.

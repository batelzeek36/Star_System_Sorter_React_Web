# Star System Sorter (S³) — Research Methodology Dataset (v1.0.0)

**Publication Date:** October 24, 2025

## Overview

This dataset establishes the research methodology and initial outputs for Star System Sorter (S³), a digital humanities project that maps Human Design Gate·Line combinations to star system archetypes using scholarly-style comparative mythology research.

This v1.0.0 release provides a **public, citable timestamp** of our methodology while research continues. Future versions will add complete research outputs.

---

## What's Included in v1.0.0

### Methodology
- **Bulletproof Research Workflow** - Complete methodology with quality gates and citation requirements
- **Baseline Prompts** - 8 star system baseline prompts (Pleiades, Sirius, Lyra, Andromeda, Orion Light, Orion Dark, Arcturus, Draco)
- **Template Prompts** - Structured approach for Pass A and Pass C research

### Research Outputs (Examples)
- **3 Completed Star System Baselines** - Pleiades, Sirius, Orion Light (JSON format with full citations)
- **Enhanced JSON Schema** - Data structure with provenance tracking
- **Human Design Documentation** - Reference materials

### Supporting Documents
- **Prior Art Comparison** - Market landscape analysis establishing novelty
- **Methodology Documentation** - Complete research process

## Why This Dataset Exists

**Purpose:** Establish a priority date and make our research approach auditable, defensible, and citable.

**Key Novelty:** To our knowledge (as of Oct 2025), first application to combine:
1. Human Design Gate·Line analysis (384 combinations)
2. Multi-translation I Ching citations
3. Transparent scoring algorithm
4. Star system lore mapping with scholarly-style provenance

**Approach:** This is an interpretive humanities project, not scientific prediction. All claims are properly sourced with translator names, ISBNs, and page numbers.

## Research Scope

**Completed (v1.0.0):**
- Bulletproof methodology with quality gates
- 8 star system baseline prompts
- 3 example JSON outputs with full citations
- Data schema and validation structure

**In Progress (Future Versions):**
- Complete 64 Human Design gates research
- 6 line archetypes
- 384 Gate·Line combinations (exhaustive I Ching line text research)
- Additional star system baselines

**Estimated Total Research:** 862-1,656 hours across all phases

## Acknowledgments

Research methodology developed independently. I Ching translations cited include Wilhelm, Huang, Karcher, and others as documented in individual JSON outputs.

Human Design system created by Ra Uru Hu. This project uses HD structure as a framework for comparative mythology research, not as endorsement of HD's metaphysical claims.

## Relationship to Human Design Platforms

S³ is designed to **augment** existing Human Design outputs, not replace them. We treat HD charting platforms (myBodyGraph, Genetic Matrix, etc.) as upstream data sources and add a synthesis layer they don't offer. S³ is complementary to these platforms.

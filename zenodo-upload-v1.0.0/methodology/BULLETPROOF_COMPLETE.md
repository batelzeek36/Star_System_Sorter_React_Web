### 6. JSON Output Format Updates
Added to all source objects:
```json
{
  "title": "Full Title",
  "author": "Full Name",
  "edition": "Specific Edition",
  "year": 2024,
  "page": "Specific Location",
  "quote": "Actual verbatim quote from source",
  "url": "https://...",
  "source_type": "ancient|research|channeled|...",
  "verified": true  // ← NEW MANDATORY FIELD
}
```

**SIRIUS ONLY - Additional fields:**
```json
{
  "astronomical_component": "A|B|C|unspecified",  // ← SIRIUS ONLY
  "component_reasoning": "Why this component",     // ← SIRIUS ONLY
  "verified": true
}
```

## Special Handling by System

### SIRIUS

- 30% unspecified threshold (vs 20% for others)

### PLEIADES
- Cross-cultural validation requirements
- Seven Sisters pattern documentation
- Ancient myths vs modern overlay separation

### LYRA
- Feline vs avian inconsistency tracking
- Root race theory connections
- Lyran-Draco war references

### ANDROMEDA
- Symbolic vs direct evidence distinction
- Greek mythology marked as symbolic only
- Contactee sources labeled appropriately

### ORION LIGHT
- Light vs Dark Orion distinction
- Egyptian Orion-Osiris link (HIGH ancient support)
- Bauval theory marked as disputed
- Thoth/Hermes connections noted

### ORION DARK
- Orion Dark vs Orion Light distinction
- Orion Dark vs Draco distinction
- Shadow work nuance (not just "evil")
- Law of One "negative polarity" references

### ARCTURUS
- Edgar Cayce readings with reading numbers
- Ancient support explicitly LOW/UNKNOWN
- All channeled sources labeled

### DRACO
- Ancient dragon myths (HIGH ancient support)
- Icke material marked controversial and disputed
- Shadow vs Light Draco distinguished
- East vs West dragon duality noted
- Kundalini NOT conflated with Draco

### ZETA RETICULI
- Hill star map marked as disputed
- Ancient support explicitly NONE
- Astronomical facts separated from ET claims
- Hybrid program evolution documented

## Impact Assessment

### Before Bulletproofing
- AI could use "unknown" fields
- Placeholder quotes acceptable
- Vague page references allowed
- Missing translator/editor for ancient texts
- Abbreviated titles and author names
- No verification requirement

### After Bulletproofing
- **Zero tolerance for "unknown" fields**
- **All quotes must be verbatim from source**
- **Specific page numbers required**
- **Translator/editor mandatory for ancient texts**
- **Full titles and author names required**
- **Every source must have `"verified": true`**

### Rejection Triggers
Any single one of these will cause rejection:
1. Missing `"verified": true` field
2. Placeholder quotes
3. "Unknown" or missing page numbers
4. Missing translator/editor for ancient texts
5. Abbreviated titles or author initials
6. Missing edition information
7. Blog sources or personal websites
8. Social media posts or YouTube videos
9. More than 20% missing URLs (30% for Sirius)
10. Vague page references

## Testing Recommendations

### Phase 1: Spot Check (Immediate)
Run Perplexity Comet on 2-3 systems to verify:
- ✅ No placeholder quotes
- ✅ No "unknown" fields
- ✅ All sources have `"verified": true`
- ✅ Ancient sources have translator/editor
- ✅ Specific page numbers provided

### Phase 2: Full Validation (Before Production)
Run all 9 systems through Perplexity Comet:
- ✅ SIRIUS: Astronomical components properly inferred
- ✅ PLEIADES: Cross-cultural patterns documented
- ✅ LYRA: Feline vs avian inconsistencies noted
- ✅ ANDROMEDA: Symbolic vs direct evidence distinguished
- ✅ ORION LIGHT: Light vs Dark distinction clear
- ✅ ORION DARK: Shadow work nuance included
- ✅ ARCTURUS: Cayce readings with numbers
- ✅ DRACO: Ancient myths vs modern separated
- ✅ ZETA RETICULI: Hill map dispute documented

### Phase 3: Quality Metrics
Track across all 9 systems:
- Average sources per characteristic (target: 5+)
- Percentage with URLs (target: >80%)
- Percentage ancient sources with translator (target: 100%)
- Percentage "unspecified" (SIRIUS only, target: <30%)
- Zero placeholder quotes (target: 0)
- Zero "unknown" fields (target: 0)

**Contents:**
- All 9 original baseline files
- Preserved before any bulletproof changes
- Can be restored if needed

**Restore Command:**
```bash
cp lore-research/prompts/PHASE_0_STAR_SYSTEMS/backups/pre-bulletproof-20251024/*.txt \

```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **COMPLETE** - All 9 baseline prompts bulletproofed
2. ⏭️ **NEXT** - Test with Perplexity Comet on 2-3 systems
3. ⏭️ **THEN** - Run full baseline research for all 9 systems
4. ⏭️ **FINALLY** - Validate output quality meets standards

## Success Criteria

The bulletproofing is successful if:
- ✅ Zero placeholder quotes in any output
- ✅ Zero "unknown" fields in any output
- ✅ 100% of ancient sources have translator/editor
- ✅ 100% of sources have `"verified": true`
- ✅ >80% of sources have URLs when available
- ✅ All page numbers are specific and verifiable
- ✅ All titles and author names are complete
- ✅ SIRIUS: <30% unspecified astronomical components
- ✅ All other systems: <20% missing URLs

**Status: READY FOR TESTING** 🚀

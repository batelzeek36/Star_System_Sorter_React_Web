  "research_notes": "Sirius demonstrates strong consensus across multiple traditions for teacher/wisdom-keeper archetype with extremely high ancient support (Egyptian Sopdet/Sothis, Zoroastrian Tishtrya). The Egyptian tradition is particularly robust with direct Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts evidence from Faulkner and Mercer translations. The Dogon-Sirius B controversy remains disputed with strong counter-evidence from van Beek (1991, Current Anthropology) and Sagan (1979, published book). Modern channeled material (Bailey, Cori, Law of One) consistently portrays Sirius as source of spiritual hierarchy and evolutionary guidance. Astronomical component assignments: Ancient sources pre-1862 = Component A (visible star); Dogon/Temple/Griaule material regarding po tolo/digitaria = Component B (white dwarf); Modern channeled material without stellar specificity = unspecified. All sources now include ISBN, DOI/JSTOR, or translator credentials. Wikipedia and blog sources removed; only primary published sources retained."

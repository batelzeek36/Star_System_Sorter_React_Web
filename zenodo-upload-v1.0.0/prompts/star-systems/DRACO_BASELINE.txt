# DRACO BASELINE RESEARCH

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔒 HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
1. **Blog sources** (WordPress, Medium, personal websites, starseed blogs) - UNACCEPTABLE
2. **Anonymous authors** ("Various researchers", "Contemporary sources") - UNACCEPTABLE
3. **Fabricated quotes or page numbers** - UNACCEPTABLE

7. **YouTube videos or podcasts** - UNACCEPTABLE (unless published transcript with ISBN)
8. **Wiki-style sites without citations** - UNACCEPTABLE

✅ SOURCE HIERARCHY (Use in order of preference):

**TIER 1 - ACCEPTABLE PRIMARY SOURCES:**
1. Published books with ISBN (channeled or research)
2. Academic papers and peer-reviewed journals
3. Established ancient texts with scholarly translations
4. Documented oral traditions via anthropologists

**TIER 2 - ACCEPTABLE SECONDARY SOURCES:**
1. University/museum websites with citations
2. Established mystery school publications

⚠️ **WIKIPEDIA & ONLINE ENCYCLOPEDIAS:**
Wikipedia, Encyclopedia.com, Britannica.com, and ALL online encyclopedia/aggregator sites are **COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN** - not as primary sources, not as secondary sources, not at all. These are lazy shortcuts. Instead:
- Find the PRIMARY SOURCE that the encyclopedia cites (the actual book, journal, or ancient text)
- Cite that source directly with full bibliographic information
- Example: Don't cite "Wikipedia article on Draco" → Cite the actual ancient text or published book
- If an encyclopedia mentions a scholar's work, find and cite that scholar's published book or paper

**FORBIDDEN ENCYCLOPEDIA SITES (NEVER USE):**
❌ Wikipedia.org
❌ Encyclopedia.com
❌ Britannica.com / Encyclopaedia Britannica
❌ Ancient.eu / WorldHistory.org
❌ Mythopedia.com
❌ Any site with "encyclopedia", "wiki", or "pedia" in the domain

**FORBIDDEN BLOG/PERSONAL SITES (NEVER USE):**
❌ WordPress blogs (*.wordpress.com)
❌ Tripod sites (*.tripod.com)
❌ Personal domains (crystalinks, preterhuman.net, etc.)
❌ Goodreads.com (book review site, not primary source)

**ACCEPTABLE SOURCES - USE THESE:**
✅ Archive.org - Full book scans with page numbers
✅ Sacred-texts.com - Proper ancient text translations
✅ Publisher websites - Book excerpts with ISBNs
✅ Academic databases - JSTOR, academia.edu, university repositories
✅ Google Books - Preview pages with actual page numbers

This is a **lore-grade research project**, not a homework assignment. Use authoritative primary sources only.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔥 NO EXCUSES - YOU CAN DO THIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**DO NOT give up and return empty results.** The Sirius and Pleiades baseline research successfully found complete citations.

**YOU MUST DO THE SAME FOR DRACO.**

**Where to find sources:**
✅ Archive.org - Full book scans with page numbers
✅ Google Books - Preview pages with quotes
✅ Publisher websites - Book excerpts and ISBNs
✅ Academic databases - JSTOR, academia.edu, university repositories
✅ Sacred-texts.com - Ancient text translations

**Known sources you MUST find and cite properly:**

**Ancient Dragon Mythology:**
1. Chinese texts - "Classic of Mountains and Seas" (Shanhaijing)
2. European medieval texts - "Beowulf", dragon legends
3. Mesopotamian - Tiamat in Enuma Elish
4. Greek - Ladon (dragon guarding golden apples)

**Academic/Scholarly:**
5. "Dragons: A Natural History" by Karl Shuker
6. "The Dragon in China and Japan" by M.W. de Visser
7. Academic papers on comparative dragon mythology

**Modern Esoteric (Mark as controversial):**
8. David Icke - "The Biggest Secret" (1999) - Reptilian claims (DISPUTED)
9. R.A. Boulay - "Flying Serpents and Dragons" (1990)

**FORBIDDEN SOURCES (DO NOT USE):**
❌ Conspiracy theory blogs

❌ Wikipedia (find the primary source it cites instead)

**If you return empty characteristics or say "I cannot access books", your response will be REJECTED.**

## OBJECTIVE
Research DRACO and dragon archetype across cultures. CRITICAL: Separate ancient dragon symbolism from modern conspiracy theories.

## ACADEMIC CONTEXT

This research supports Star System Sorter, which maps Human Design's I Ching-based gate system to star mythology.

**Human Design's Academic Foundations:**
- **I Ching (64 hexagrams)** - 3,000+ years of scholarship, Jung's endorsement (Wilhelm translation, 1950)
- **64 DNA codons** - Nobel Prize research (Nirenberg & Khorana, 1968)
- **Kabbalah (Tree of Life)** - Extensive academic study (Scholem, Idel)
- **Chakra system** - Religious Studies, Yoga Studies (Feuerstein)
- **Western Astrology** - Cultural/historical phenomenon (Tarnas)

**Mathematical Correspondences:**
- 64 I Ching hexagrams = 64 DNA codons (verifiable fact)
- Binary yin/yang logic = Binary genetic code (A/T, C/G)

**Your Task:** Document star system characteristics using rigorous sourcing standards (ancient texts, published books, proper citations). This is **comparative mythology research**, not pseudoscience.

## HYPOTHESIS TO VALIDATE
- Power, control, dominance
- Hierarchy and royalty
- Reptilian/dragon archetype
- Genetic manipulators (disputed)
- Often misunderstood or polarized as evil (but not inherently so)

## REFERENCE LIBRARY

**Before researching, review:** `lore-research/source-mining/!ESOTERIC_SOURCE_LIBRARY.md` - 300+ verified sources.

## PRIMARY SOURCES

### Ancient Dragon Mythology (HIGH ancient support)
- Chinese: Dragons as wisdom, imperial power, yang energy
- European: Dragons as guardians of treasure, chaos
- Mayan: Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl (feathered serpent)
- Norse: Níðhöggr, Fáfnir
- Babylonian: Tiamat (primordial chaos dragon)
- Hindu/Buddhist: Naga serpents (wisdom, power)

### Astronomical
- Thuban (Alpha Draconis) - former pole star (3000 BCE)
- Draco constellation mythology

### Modern Esoteric (CONTROVERSIAL)
- "The Biggest Secret" by David Icke (1999) - MARK AS DISPUTED
- "Blue Blood, True Blood" by Stewart Swerdlow
- Various channeled material on Draco entities

## CRITICAL: Disputed Claims Handling

**David Icke's "reptilian" conspiracy theories are highly controversial.** You MUST:
1. Include them (they're part of the discourse)
2. Mark as `disputed: true`
3. Include counter-evidence or skeptical sources
4. Note: `source_type: "controversial"`

## SPECIAL FOCUS: Shadow vs Light Draco

Document any sources that distinguish:
- Shadow Draco (control, manipulation, negative)
- Light Draco (power, sovereignty, positive)
- Eastern vs Western dragon duality (wisdom vs evil)

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT conflate Draco with kundalini - that's a common stretch in the lore community without solid evidence.

An **undefined / open G** samples identities, places, and loves, and is most correct when it lets *place and people* show it who it is.\n\nKey Jovian-style lines (all < 25 words):\n- “This is the center of love, direction, and identity.”\n- “The Magnetic Monopole lives here.”\n- “Place is destiny for the open G.”\n- “Love is a frequency carried by the G Center.”\n\nDistortion / not-self: trying to ‘find’ love or direction mentally instead of letting Strategy & Authority bring the right people and places to the G.",

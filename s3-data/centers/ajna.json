Three streams move through it: logic (63-4-17-62), abstract (64-47-11-56), and individual (61-24-43-23). Core not-self theme: attempting to be certain about things the mind can never be certain about.\n\nKey Jovian phrases used:\n- “The Ajna governs mental awareness, analysis, and conceptualization.”\n- “It’s where you process and organize information.”\n- “A defined Ajna means you have a fixed way of thinking.”",

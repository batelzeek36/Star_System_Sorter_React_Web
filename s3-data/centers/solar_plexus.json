Individual (mood, spirit, melancholy → creativity)\n3. Collective/abstract (experience, drama, meaning)\n\nKey lines (< 25 words):\n- “The Solar Plexus is the emotional authority for humanity.”\n- “Clarity never comes in the now.”\n- “Ride the wave before deciding.”\n- “Emotions are chemistry; let it change.”",

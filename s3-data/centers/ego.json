  "notes": "The Ego / Heart / Will center is the motor for promises, worth, and material/tribal bargains. It is small and intermittent — it is not designed to work all day. Defined Ego → fixed sense of value and capacity to commit; undefined Ego → vulnerability to proving, overworking, and taking on promises to look worthy. Classic Jovian-style teachings stress: “Never promise from an undefined Heart.”\n\nApprox. Jovian-style keynotes under 25 words (not verbatim from Line Companion):\n- “This is the center of willpower and material commitments.”\n- “Ego is tribal: it bargains, it doesn’t universalize.”\n- “Only promise what the Heart can actually do.”\n- “Rest is part of the bargain.”",

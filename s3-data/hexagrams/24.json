    "legge_1899_public_domain": "Fû indicates that there will be free course and progress (in what it denotes). (The subject of it) finds no one to distress him in his exits and entrances; friends come to him, and no error is committed. He will return and repeat his (proper) course. In seven days comes his return. There will be advantage in whatever direction movement is made.",
    "normalized_summary": "The turning point after breakdown. Vital energy comes back online. You correct course and return to right conduct. Quiet, honest re-alignment is fully supported. Acting aggressively from confusion — especially trying to mobilize others — backfires hard and creates long-term damage."

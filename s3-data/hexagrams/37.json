    "legge_1899_public_domain": "For (the realisation of what is taught in) K\\i Z an, (or for the regulation of the family), what is and unsympathising sovereign. Hence comes its name of Ming 1 , or ‘Intelligence Wounded,’ that is, injured and repressed. The treatment of the subject shows how such an officer will conduct himself, and maintain his purpose. The symbolism of the figure is treated of in the same way in the first and second Appendixes. Appendix VI merely says that the advance set forth in 35 is sure to meet with wounding, and hence Bin is followed by Ming L Line x is strong, and in its right place;—its subject should be going forward. But the general signification of the hexagram supposes him to be wounded. The wound, however, being re ceived at the very commencement of its action, is but slight. And hence comes the emblem of a bird hurt so as to be obliged to droop its wings. The subject then appears directly as ‘ the supe rior man. 1 He sees it to be his course to desist from the stri^gle for a time, and is so rapt in the thought that he can fast for three days and not think of it. When he does withdraw, opposition follows him; but it is implied that he holds on to his own good purpose. Line 2 is weak, but also in its right place, and central; giving us the idea of an officer, obedient to duty and the right. His wound in the left thigh may impede his movements, but does not disable him. He finds means to save himself, and maintains his good purpose. Line 3, strong and in a strong place, is the topmost line of the lower trigram. It responds also to line 6, in which the idea of the sovereign, emblemed by the upper trigram, is concentrated. The lower tngram is the emblem of light or brightness, the idea of which again is expressed by the south, to which we turn when we look at the sun in its meridian height. Hence the subject of the sect. II. THE Klk 2AN HEXAGRAM. 1 37 most advantageous is that the wife be firm and correct. 1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject establishing restrictive regulations in his household. Occasion for repentance will disappear. 2. The second line, divided, shows its subject taking nothing on herself, but in her central place attending to the preparation of the food. Through her firm correctness there will be good fortune. 3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject (treating) the members of the household with stern severity. There will be occasion for repentance, there will be peril, (but) there will (also) be good fortune. If the wife and children were to be smirk ing and chattering, in the end there would be occa sion for regret. 4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject line becomes a hunter pursuing his game, and successfully. The good officer will be successful in his struggle; but let him not be over eager to put all things right at once. Line 4 is weak, but in its right place. Aft list says he does not understand the symbolism, as given in the Text. The translation indicates the view of it commonly accepted. The subject of the line evidently escapes from his position of danger with little damage. Line 5 should be the place of the ruler or sovereign in the hex agram; but 6 is assigned as that place in Ming I. The officer occupying 5, the centre of the upper trigram, and near to the sovereign, has his ideal in the count of K\\, whose action appears in the Shft, III, pp. 123, 127, 128. He is a historical personage. Line 6 sets forth the fate of the ruler, who opposes himself to the officer who would do him good and intelligent service, Instead of becoming as the sun, enlightening all from the height of the sky, he is as the sun hidden below the earth. I can well believe that the writer had the last king of Shang in his mind. ! 3 ! enriching the family. There will be great good fortune. 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows the influence of the king extending to his family. There need be no anxiety; there will be good fortune. 6. The topmost line, undivided, shows its subject possessed of sincerity and arrayed in majesty. In the end there will be good fortune. XXXVII, K\\i Zi n, the name of the hexagram, simply means ‘ a household,’ or 1 the members of a family.’ The subject of the essay based on the figure, however, is the regulation of the family, effected mainly by the co-operation of husband and wife in their several spheres, and only needing to become universal to secure the good order of the kingdom. The important place occupied by the wife in the family is seen in the short sentence of the T h w a n. That she be firm and correct, and do her part well, is the first thing necessary to its regulation. Line r is strong, and in a strong place. It suggests the necessity of strict rule in governing the family. Regulations must be estab lished, and their observance strictly insisted on. Line 2 is weak, and in the proper place for it,—the centre, more over, of the lower trigram. It fitly represents the wife, and what is said on it tells us of her special sphere and duty; and that she should be unassuming in regard to all beyond her sphere; always being firm and correct. See the Shih, III, 350. Line 3 is strong, and in an odd place. If the place were central, the strength would be tempered; but the subject of the line, in the topmost place of the trigram, may be expected to exceed in severity. But severity is not a bad thing in regulating a familyit is better than laxity and indulgence. Line 4 is weak, and in its proper place. The wife is again suggested to us,, and we are told, that notwithstanding her being confined to the internal affairs of the household, she can do much to enrich the family. The subject of the strong fifth line appears as the king. This maybe the husband spoken of as also a king; or the real king whose merit is revealed first in his family, as often in the Shih, where king Wan is the , theme. The central place here tempers the display of the strength and power. SECT. 11 .",
    "normalized_summary": "Right order in the household. Roles are clear, speech is sincere, discipline is real but not cruel, and the inner management of the home is steady and correct. When the home is regulated like this — beginning with integrity in the 'inside' position — security, prosperity, and authority naturally extend outward."

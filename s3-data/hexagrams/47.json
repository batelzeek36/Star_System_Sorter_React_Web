    "legge_1899_public_domain": "In (the condition denoted by) Khwan there may (yet be) progress and success. For the firm and hexagram, it shows him to be possessed of modesty and force. Then the ruler’s seat, the fifth place, is occupied by a divided line, indi cating that he will welcome the advance of 2. The officer therefore both has the qualities that fit him to advance, and a favourable opportunity to do so. The result of his advance will be fortunate. It is said that after he has met with the ruler, ‘ the great man ’ in 5, ‘ advance to the south will be fortunate.’ Affi Hst and other critics say that ‘ advancing to the south ’ is equivalent simply to ‘ advancing forwards.’ The south is the region of brightness and warmth; advance towards it will be a joyful progress, As P. Regis explains the phrase, the traveller will proceed ‘via recta simillima illi qua itur ad austrates felicesque plagas.’ Line 1 is weak, where it should be strong; its subject, that is, is humble and docile. Those above him, therefore, welcome his advance. Another interpretation of the line is suggested by Appen dix I; which deserves consideration. As the first line of Sun, moreover, it may be supposed to concentrate in itself its attribute of docility, and be the lord of the trigram. See on the second line of 3 b u i. Line 2 is strong, and the weak 5 is its proper correlate. We have a strong officer serving a weak ruler; he could not do so unless he were penetrated with a sincere and devoted loyalty. Paragraph 3 describes the boldness and fearlessness of the advance of the third line. According to the Khang-hst editors, who, I think, are right, there is a shade of condemnation in the line. Its subject is too bold. Line 4 occupies the place of a great minister, in immediate con tiguity to his ruler, who confides in him, and raises him to the highest distinction as a feudal prince. The mention of mount correct, the (really) great man, there will be good fortune. He will fall into no error. If he make speeches, his words cannot be made good. 1. The first line, divided, shows its subject with bare buttocks straitened under the stump of a tree. He enters a dark valley, and for three years has no prospect (of deliverance). 2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject straitened amidst his wine and viands, There come to him anon the red knee-covers (of the ruler). It will be well for him (to maintain his sincerity as) in sacrificing. Active operations (on his part) will lead to evil, but he will be free from blame. 3. The third line, divided, shows its subject straitened before a (frowning) rock. He lays hold of thorns. He enters his palace, and does not see his wife, There will be evil. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject proceeding very slowly (to help the subject of the first line), who is straitened by the carriage adorned with metal in front of him. There will be occasion for regret, but the end will be good. Kh\\ y at the foot of which was the capital of the lords of Aau, seems to take the paragraph out of the sphere of symbolism into that of history, ‘The king’ in it is the last sovereign of Shang; the feudal prince in it is Wan. In line 5 the advance has reached the highest point of dignity, and firm correctness is specially called for. ‘ Ascending the steps of a stair may intimate, as Wu Hsi says, the ease of the advance; or according to others (the Khang-hst editors among them), its ceremonious manner. What can the subject of the hexagram want more ? He has gained all his wishes, and still he is for going onwards. His advance is blind and foolish; and only the most exact correctness will save him from the consequences. SECT. II. THE KHWAN HEXAGRAM. 1 63 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject with his nose and feet cut off. He is straitened by (his ministers in their) scarlet aprons. He is leisurely in his movements, however, and is satisfied. It will be well for him to be (as sincere) as in sacrificing (to spiritual beings). 6 . The sixth line, divided, shows its subject strait ened, as if bound with creepers; or in a high and dangerous position, and saying (to himself), ‘If I move, I shall repent it.' If he do repent of former errors, there will be good fortune in his going forward. XLVII. The character Khwan presents us with the picture of a tree within an enclosure; ‘ a plant,’ according to Williams, ‘ fading for want of room; ’ ‘a tree,’ according to Tai Tung, ‘not allowed to spread its branches.’ However this be, the term conveys the idea of being straitened and distressed; and this hexagram indicates a state of things in which the order and government that would conduce to the well-being of the country can hardly get the develop ment, which, by skilful management on the part of ‘the great man' and others, is finally secured for them. Looking at the figure we see that the two central places are occupied by strong lines; but 2 is confined between 1 and 3, both of which are weak, and g (the ruler), as well as 4 (his minister), is covered by the weak 6; all which peculiarities are held to indicate the repression or straitening of good men by bad. For the way in which the same view is derived from the great symbolism, see Appendix II, in loc. The concluding sentence of the Th wan is literally, ‘ If he speak, he will not be believed; ’ but the Khang-hsi editors give sufficient reasons for changing one character so as to give the meaning in the translation. ‘ Actions,’ not words, are what are required in the case, The symbolism of ‘ buttocks' is rather a favourite with the duke of Aauchacun a son gofit.’ The poor subject of line 1 sitting on a mere stump, which affords him no shelter, is indeed badly off. The line is at the bottom of the trigram indicating peril, and 4, which is its proper correlate, is so circumstanced as not to be able 164 the yf king. text. j",
    "normalized_summary": "Extreme pressure. You feel hemmed in, depleted, blocked, maybe even humiliated. Still — real progress is possible if you keep inner correctness and act with quiet sincerity instead of talking big. Support from true greatness (nobility of character, not status) brings good fortune. Words alone won’t get you out; disciplined endurance will."

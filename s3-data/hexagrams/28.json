The second line, undivided, shows a decayed the strong line below, which is not proper, and then from tin* strong 6, not its proper correlate, and too far removed. In either case the thing is evil.

There will be good fortune. If (the subject of it) looks for other (help but that of line one), there will be cause for regret. 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows a decayed willow producing flowers, or an old wife in posses sion of her young husband. There will be occasion neither for blame nor for praise. 6.

Very extraordinary times require very extraordinary gifts in the conduct of affairs in them. This is the text on which king Wan and his son discourse after their fashion in this hexa gram. What goes, in their view, to constitute anything extraor dinary is its greatness and difficulty. There need not be about it what is not right. Looking at the figure we see two weak lines at the top and bottom, and four strong lines between them, giving us the idea of a great beam unable to sustain its own weight. But the second and fifth lines are both strong and in the centre; and from this and the attributes of the component trigrams a good auspice is obtained. Line x being weak, and at the bottom of the figure, and of the trigram Sun, which denotes flexibility and humility, its subject is distinguished by his carefulness, as in the matter mentioned; and there is a good auspice. Line 2 has no proper correlate above. Hence he inclines to the weak 1 below him; and we have the symbolism of the line. An TUT. vt TCTNG.",
    "normalized_summary": "Overload. The main beam is bending. This is an extreme moment that can’t last as-is. You may have to carry more than is reasonable, act beyond normal limits, or relocate your weight so the structure doesn’t snap. Bold, responsive movement — with integrity, not panic — can still succeed, but pretending it's ‘business as usual’ is dangerous."

    "legge_1899_public_domain": "Hsien indicates that, (on the fulfilment of the conditions implied in it), there will be free course and success. Its advantageousness will depend on the being firm and correct, (as) in marrying a young lady. There will be good fortune.",
    "normalized_summary": "Mutual attraction, emotional influence, responsive resonance. Real connection is auspicious — but only when it’s upright, restrained, and sincere, like a proper marriage bond. Restless chasing, clinging pursuit, or sweet-talking seduction weakens the influence and brings regret. Calm integrity draws what’s meant to come to you."

The third line, undivided, shows one moving his thighs, and keeping close hold of those whom he follows. Going forward (in this way) will cause regret. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows that firm correctness which will lead to good fortune, and prevent all occasion for repentance.

    "normalized_summary": "Mutual attraction, emotional influence, responsive resonance. Real connection is auspicious — but only when it’s upright, restrained, and sincere, like a proper marriage bond. Restless chasing, clinging pursuit, or sweet-talking seduction weakens the influence and brings regret. Calm integrity draws what’s meant to come to you."

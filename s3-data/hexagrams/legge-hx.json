Here therefore in the west, the hereditary territory of the house of Mu, are blessings which might enrich the whole kingdom; but they are somehow restrained. The dense clouds do not empty their stores. P. Regis says:—'To declare openly that no rain fell from the heavens long covered with dense clouds over the great tract of country, which stretched from the western border to the court and on to the eastern sea, was nothing else but leaving it to all thought ful minds to draw the conclusion that the family of Wkn was as worthy of the supreme seat as that of Shau, the tyrant, however ancient, was unworthy of it (vol. i, p. 356).'

Line 2 is also strong, and though an even place is not appropriate to it, that place being central, its subject will make common cause with the subject of line 1; and there will be good fortune. Line 3, though strong, and in a proper place, yet not being in the centre, is supposed to be less able to resist the restraint of line 4; and hence it has the ill omens that are given. The subject of line 4, one weak line against all the strong lines of the hexagram, might well expect wounds, and feel apprehension in trying to restrain the,others; but it is in its proper place; it is the first line also of Sun, whose attribute is docile flexibility. sect. 1 . 1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject treading his accustomed path. If he go forward, there will be no error. 2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject treading the path that is level and easy;a quiet and solitary man, to whom, if he be firm and correct, there will be good fortune. 3. The third line, divided, shows a one-eyed man (who thinks he) can see; a lame man (who thinks he) can walk well; one who treads on the tail of a tiger and is bitten. (All this indicates) ill fortune. We have a (mere) bravo acting the part of a great ruler. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject treading on the tail of a tiger. He becomes full of apprehensive caution, and in the end there will be good fortune. 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows the resolute tread of its subject.

The sixth line, undivided, tells us to look at (the whole course) that is trodden, and examine the The strong lines are moved to sympathy and help, and ‘there is no mistake.’ Line 5 occupies the central place of Sun, and converts, by the sincerity of its subject, 4 and 6 into its neighbours, who suffer themselves to be used by it, and effect their common object. In line 6, the idea of the hexagram has run its course. The harmony of nature is restored. The rain falls, and the onward march of the strong lines should now stop. But weakness that has achieved such a result, if it plume itself on it, will be in a position of peril; and like the full moon, which must henceforth wane.

The character giving its name to the hexagram plays an im portant part also in the symbolism; and this may be the reason why it does not, as the name, occupy the first place in the Thwan. Looking at the figure, we see it is made up of the trigrams Tui, representing a marsh, and /sf/nen, representing the sky. Tui is a yin trigram, and its top line is divided. Below A 7 hen, the great symbol of strength, it may readily suggest the idea of treading on a tiger's tail, which was an old way of expressing what was hazardous (Shu V, xxv, 2). But what suggests the statement that ‘the tiger does not bite the treader?’ The attribute of Tui is pleased satisfaction. Of course such an attribute could not be predicated of one who was in the fangs of a tiger. The coming scatheless out of such danger further suggests the idea of ‘ progress and success' in the course which king Wan had in his mind. And according to Appendix VI, that course was ‘ propriety,’ the observance of all the rules of courtesy. On these, as so many stepping-stones, one may tread safely amid scenes of disorder and peril. Line 1 is an undivided line in an odd place; giving us the ideas of activity, firmness, and correctness. One so characterised will act rightly. Line 2 occupies the middle place of the trigram, which is sup posed to symbolise a path cut straight and level along the hill-side, or over difficult ground. Line 5 is not a proper correlate, and hence the idea of the subject of 2 being 1 a quiet and solitary man.’ Line 3 is neither central nor in an even place, which would be proper to it. But with the strength of will which the occupant of an odd place should possess, he goes forward with the evil results so variously emblemed. The editors of the imperial edition, in illustration of the closing sentence, refer to Analects VII, x.

The character giving its name to the hexagram plays an im portant part also in the symbolism; and this may be the reason why it does not, as the name, occupy the first place in the Thwan. Looking at the figure, we see it is made up of the trigrams Tui, representing a marsh, and /sf/nen, representing the sky. Tui is a yin trigram, and its top line is divided. Below A 7 hen, the great symbol of strength, it may readily suggest the idea of treading on a tiger's tail, which was an old way of expressing what was hazardous (Shu V, xxv, 2). But what suggests the statement that ‘the tiger does not bite the treader?’ The attribute of Tui is pleased satisfaction. Of course such an attribute could not be predicated of one who was in the fangs of a tiger. The coming scatheless out of such danger further suggests the idea of ‘ progress and success' in the course which king Wan had in his mind. And according to Appendix VI, that course was ‘ propriety,’ the observance of all the rules of courtesy. On these, as so many stepping-stones, one may tread safely amid scenes of disorder and peril. Line 1 is an undivided line in an odd place; giving us the ideas of activity, firmness, and correctness. One so characterised will act rightly. Line 2 occupies the middle place of the trigram, which is sup posed to symbolise a path cut straight and level along the hill-side, or over difficult ground. Line 5 is not a proper correlate, and hence the idea of the subject of 2 being 1 a quiet and solitary man.’ Line 3 is neither central nor in an even place, which would be proper to it. But with the strength of will which the occupant of an odd place should possess, he goes forward with the evil results so variously emblemed. The editors of the imperial edition, in illustration of the closing sentence, refer to Analects VII, x. Line 4 is in contiguity with 5, whose subject is in the place of authority; but he occupies the place proper to a weak or divided line, and hence he bethinks himself, and goes softly. Beneath the symbolism under line g, lies the principle that the most excellent thing in ‘ propriety ’ is humility. And the subject of the line, which is strong and central, will not be lacking in this, but bear in mind that the . higher he is exalted, the greater may be his fall. SECT. I. THE THAI HEXAGRAM. 8 1"

The movement of the first will be supported by that of the others, and be fortunate. The second line is strong, but in an even place. This is sup posed to temper the strength of its subject; which is expressed by the first of his characteristics. But the even place is the central; and it is responded to by a proper correlate in the fifth line above. Hence come all the symbolism of the paragraph and the auspice of good fortune implied in it. Beneath the symbolism in paragraph 3 there lies the persuasion of the constant change that is taking place in nature and in human affairs, As night succeeds to day, and winter to summer, so calamity may be expected to follow prosperity, and decay the flourishing of a state. The third is the last of the lines of JT/zien, by whose strength and activity the happy state of Thiti has been produced. Another aspect of things maybe looked for; but by firmness and correctness the good estate of the present may be long continued. According to the treatise on the Thwan, the subjects of the fourth and other upper lines are not ‘the small returning’ as opponents of the strong lines below, as is generally supposed; but as the correlates of those lines, of one heart and mind with them to maintain the state of Thai, and giving them, humbly but readily, all the help in their power. Tt-yf, the last sovereign but one of the Yin dynasty, reigned from b.c. 1191 to nfig; but what was the history of him and his sister here referred to we do not know. P.

The first line, divided, suggests the idea of grass pulled up, and bringing with it other stalks with whose roots it is connected. With firm cor rectness (on the part of its subject), there will be good fortune and progress. 2. The second line, divided, shows its subject patient and obedient. To the small man (comport ing himself so) there will be good fortune. If the great man (comport himself) as the distress and ob struction require, he will have success. 3. The third line, divided, shows its subject ashamed of the purpose folded (in his breast). 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject acting in accordance with the ordination (of Heaven), and committing no error. His companions will come and share in his happiness. 5- In the fifth line, undivided, we see him who quent time as king Wan, and that she was the famous Thaf-sze ;— contrary to all the evidence I have been able to find on the subject. According to Khl ng-jze, Ti-yi was the first to enact a law that daughters of the royal house, in marrying princes of the states, should be in subjection to them, as if they were not superior to them m rank,. Here line 5, while occupying the place of dignity and authority m the hexagram, is yet a weak line in the place of a strong one; and its subject, accordingly, humbly condescends to his strong and proper correlate in line 2.

The sixth line, undivided, shows the overthrow (and removal of) the condition of distress and ob struction. Before this there was that condition. Hereafter there will be joy. XII. The form of Phi, it will be seen, is exactly the opposite of that of Thai. Much of what has been said on the interpretation of that will apply to this, or at least assist the student in making out the meaning of its symbolism. Phi is the hexagram of the seventh month. Genial influences have done their work, the pro cesses of growth are at an end. Henceforth increasing decay must be looked for. Naturally we should expect the advance of the subject of the first of the three weak lines to lead to evil; but if he set himself to be firm and correct, he will bring about a different issue. Patience and obedience are proper for the small man in all circumstances. If the great man in difficulty yet cherish these attributes, he will soon have a happy issue out of the distress. The third line is weak. Its place is odd, and therefore for it incorrect. Its subject would vent his evil purpose, but has not strength to do so. He is left therefore to the shame which he ought to feel without a word of warning. Does the ming of the fourth line mean ( the ordination of Heaven/ as /dfi Hsi thinks; or the orders of the ruler, as AfMng-jze says? Whichever interpre tation be taken (and some critics unite the two), the action of the subject of the line, whose strength is tempered by the even posi tion, will be good and correct, and issue in success and happiness. The strong line in the fifth, (its correct), place, brings the distress and obstruction to a close. Yet its subject—the ruler in the hexa- gram—is warned to continue to be cautious in two lines of rhyme: ‘ And let him say, “ I die 1 I die I ” So to a bushy clump his fortune he shall tie.’ There is an end of the condition of distress. It was necessary that condition should give place to its opposite; and the strong line in the topmost place fitly represents the consequent joy. THE yf KING.",

All these things are in harmony with the idea of union. But the union must be free from all selfish motives, and this is indicated by its being in the remote districts of the country, where people are unsophisticated, and free from the depraving effects incident to large societies. A union from such motives will cope with the greatest difficulties; and yet a word of caution is added. Line 1 emblems the first attempts at union. It is strong, but in the lowest place; and it has no proper correlate above. There is, however, no intermixture of selfishness in it. Lines 2 and 5 are proper correlates, which fact suggests in this hexagram the idea of their union being limited and partial, and such as may afford ground for blame. Line 3 is strong, and in an odd place; but it has not a proper cor relate in 6. This makes its subject more anxious to unite with 2; but 2 is devoted to its proper correlate in 5, of whose strength 3 is afraid, and takes the measures described. His abstaining so long, however, from any active attempt, will save him from misfortune. Line 4 is strong, but in an even place, which weakens its subject. He also would fain make an attempt on 2; but he is afraid, and does not carry his purpose into effect, Line 5 is strong, in an odd, and the central place; and would fain unite with 2, which indeed is the proper correlate of its subject. But 3 and 4 are powerful foes that oppose the union. Their opposition makes him weep; but he collects his forces, defeats them, and effects his purpose. The union reaches to all within the suburbs, and is not yet uni versal; but still there is no cause for repentance. THE Yl KING.",

But the union must be free from all selfish motives, and this is indicated by its being in the remote districts of the country, where people are unsophisticated, and free from the depraving effects incident to large societies. A union from such motives will cope with the greatest difficulties; and yet a word of caution is added. Line 1 emblems the first attempts at union. It is strong, but in the lowest place; and it has no proper correlate above. There is, however, no intermixture of selfishness in it. Lines 2 and 5 are proper correlates, which fact suggests in this hexagram the idea of their union being limited and partial, and such as may afford ground for blame. Line 3 is strong, and in an odd place; but it has not a proper cor relate in 6. This makes its subject more anxious to unite with 2; but 2 is devoted to its proper correlate in 5, of whose strength 3 is afraid, and takes the measures described. His abstaining so long, however, from any active attempt, will save him from misfortune. Line 4 is strong, but in an even place, which weakens its subject. He also would fain make an attempt on 2; but he is afraid, and does not carry his purpose into effect, Line 5 is strong, in an odd, and the central place; and would fain unite with 2, which indeed is the proper correlate of its subject. But 3 and 4 are powerful foes that oppose the union. Their opposition makes him weep; but he collects his forces, defeats them, and effects his purpose. The union reaches to all within the suburbs, and is not yet uni versal; but still there is no cause for repentance. THE Yl KING."

Hence they are held to represent parties receiving punishment, while the other lines represent parties inflicting it. The punishment in line 1 is that of the stocks, administered for a small offence, and before crime has made much way. But if the ‘depriving' of the toes is not merely keeping them in restraint, but cutting them off, as the Chinese character suggests, the punish ment appears to a western reader too severe.

The subject of the fourth line's getting those pledges indicates liis exercising his judicial functions; and what he gnaws through indi cates their dibit idly. Moreover, though the line is strong, it is in an even place; and hence comes the lesson of caution, The fifth line represents' the lord of judgment.' As it is a weak line, he will be disposed to leniency; and bis judgments will he correct. This is declared by bis finding the ‘ yellow metal; 1 for yellow is one of the five 1 correct ’ colours.

Line 2 is weak and in its proper place, but with no proper cor relate above. The strong line 3 is similarly situated. These two lines therefore keep together, and are as the beard and the chin. Line 1 follows 2. What is substantial commands and rules what is merely ornamental. Line 3 is strong, and between two weak lines, which adorn it, and bestow their favours on it. But this happy condition is from the accident of place. The subject of the line must be always correct and firm to ensure its continuance. Line 4 has its proper correlate in 1, from whose strength it should receive ornament, but 2 and the strong 3 intervene and keep them apart, so that the ornament is only white, and of no bright colour. Line 4, however, is faithful to 1, and earnest for their union. And finally line 3 appears in a good character, and not with the purpose to injure, so that the union of 1 and 4 takes place. All this is intended to indicate how ornament recognises the superiority of solidity. Compare the symbolism of the second line of ATin (3), and that of the topmost line of Khwei (38). Line 5 is in the place of honour, and has no proper correlate in 2. It therefore associates with the strong 6, which is symbolised by the heights and gardens round a city, and serving both to protect and to beautify it. Thus the subject of the line receives adorning from without, and does not of itself try to manifest it. Moreover, in his weakness, his offerings of ceremony are poor and mean. But, as Confucius said, 1 In ceremonies it is better to be sparing than extravagant.’ Hence that stinginess does not prevent a good auspice. Line 6 is at the top of the hexagram. Ornament has had its course, and here there is a return to pure, ‘white,’ simplicity, Substantiality is better than ornament. io6 THE YI KING, TEXT, 1.

Tim lesser symbolism is chiefly that of a bed or couch with its occupant. Tlu: idea of the hexagram requires this occupant to be overthrown, or at least that an attempt be made to overthrow him. Accordingly the attempt in line 1 is made by commencing with the legs of the couch. The symbolism goes on to explain itself, The object of the evil worker is the overthrow of all firm correctness. Of course there will lie evil, Line 2 is to the same effect as 1; only the foe has advanced from the legs to the frame of the couch. Line 3 also represents an ovcrlhrower; but it differs from the others in being the correlate of 6. The subject of it will take part with hint. His association is with the subject of 6, and not, as in the other weak lines, with one of its own kind. From line 4 the danger is imminent. The couch has ken overthrown. The person of the occupant is at the mercy of the destroyers. With line 5 the symbolism changes. The subject of 5 is ‘lord of all the other weak lines,' and their subjects are at his disposal. He and they are represented as fishes, following one another as if strung together, All fishes come under the category of yin. Then the symbolism changes again. The subject of 5, representing and controlling all the yin lines, is loyal to the subject of the yang sixth line. He is the rightful sovereign in his palace, and 5 leads all the others there to enjoy the sovereign’s favours, We have still different symbolism under line 6.

    "raw_text": "Wfi Wang indicates great progress and success, while there will be advantage in being firm and it; here we have one strong line, and five weak lines above it, To illustrate the subject from what we see in nature,—Po is the hexa gram of the ninth month, in which the triumph of cold and decay in the year is nearly complete. It is complete in the tenth month, whose hexagram is Khwan EE EE; then follows our hex agram Ffi, belonging to the eleventh month, in which was the winter solstice when the sun turned back in his course, and moved with a constant regular progress towards the summer solstice. In harmony with these changes of nature are the changes in the political and social stale of a nation. There is nothing in the Yi to suggest the hope of a perfect society or kingdom that cannot be moved. The strong bottom line is the first of Jan, the trigram of move ment, and the upper trigram is Khwan, denoting docility and capa city. The strong returning line will meet with no distressing obstacle, and the weak lines will change before it into strong, and be as friends. The bright quality will be developed brighter and brighter from day to day, and month to month. The sentence, ‘ In seven days comes his return,’ occasions some perplexity. If the reader will refer to hexagrams 44,33, 12,20, 23, and 2, he will see that during the months denoted by those figures, the 5th, 6th, )th, 8th, ytb, and 10th, the yin lines have gradually been prevailing over the yang, until in Khwan (2) they have extruded them entirely from the lineal figure. Then comes our Ffi, as a seventh figure, In which the yang line begins to reassert itself, and from which it goes on to extrude the yin lines in their turn. Explained therefore of the months of the year, we have to take a day for a month. And something analogous—we cannot say exactly what—must have place in society and the state. iro correct. If (its subject and his action) be not correct, he will fall into errors, and it will not be advantageous for him to move in any direction. 1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject free from all insincerity. His advance will be accom panied with good fortune. 2. The second line, divided, shows one who reaps without having ploughed (that he might reap), and gathers the produce of his third year's fields without having cultivated them the first year for that end. To such a one there will be advantage in whatever direction he may move. 3. The third line, divided, shows calamity hap pening to one who is free from insincerityas in The concluding auspice or oracle to him who finds this Fd by divination is what we might expect. The subject of line 1 is of course the undivided line, meaning here, says .ffing-jze,‘ the way of the superior man.’ There must have been some deviation from that, or ‘returning' could not be spoken of. Line 2 is in its proper place, and central; but it is weak. This is more than compensated for, however, by its adherence to line x, the fifth line not being a proper correlate. Hence the return of its subject is called excellent or admirable. Line 3 is weak, and in the uneven place of a strong line. It is the top line, moreover, of the trigram whose attribute is move ment. Hence the symbolism; but any evil issue may be prevented by a realisation of danger and by caution. Line 4 has its proper correlate in x ; different from all the other weak lines; and its course is different accordingly. f ^ ine 5 is in (he central place of honour, and the middle line of Khwan, denoting docility. Hence its auspice. Line 6 is weak; and being at the top of the hexagram, when its action of returning is all concluded, action on the part of its subject will lead to evils such as are mentioned. ‘ Ten years' seems to be a round number, signifying a long time, as in hexagram 3,2.

It is implied, though the Thwan does not say it, that he would get out of the danger. Line i is weak, at the bottom of the figure, and has no correlate above, no helper, that is, beyond itself, All these things render the case of its subject hopeless. He will by his efforts only involve himself more deeply in danger. Line 2 is strong, and in the centre. Its subject is unable, indeed, to escape altogether from the danger; but he does not involve himself more deeply in it like the subject of 1, and obtains some ease. Line 3 is weak, and occupies the place of a strong line. Its subject is in an evil case. Line 4 is weak, and will get no help from its correlate in 1. Its subject is not one who can avert the danger threatening himself and others. But his position is close to that of the ruler in 5, whose intimacy he cultivates with an unostentatious sincerity, sym- bolled by the appointments of the simple feast, and whose intelli gence he cautiously enlightens. In consequence, there will be no error. ^ The subject of line 5 is on the eve of extrication and deliverance, The waters of the defile will ere long have free vent and disappear, and the ground will be levelled and made smooth, The line is strong, in a proper place, and in the place of honour. The case of the subject of line 6 is hopeless. When danger has reached its highest point, there he is, represented by a weak line, and with no proper correlate below.

Instead of playing on his instrument of earthenware, and singing to it, he utters the groans of an old man of eighty. There will be evil. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows the manner of its subject’s coming. How abrupt it is, as with fire, with death, to be rejected (by all)! 5.

The wife occupies the lower place; and the relation between them is marked by her submission, This is sound doctrine, especially from a Chinese point of view; bull doubt whether such application of his teaching was in the mind of king' Wfin. Given two parties, an inferior and superior in correlation. If both be continuously observant of what is correct, the inferior being also submissive, and the superior firm, good fortune and progress may be predicated of their course. Line 1 has a proper correlate in 4; but between them are two strong lines; and it is itself weak. These two conditions are against its subject receiving much help from the subject of 4. He should be quiet, and not forward for action. Line 2 is strong, but in the place of a weak line. Its position, however, being central, and its subject holding fast to the due mean, the unfavourable condition of an even place is more than counteracted. Line 3 is strong, and in its proper place; but being beyond the centre of the trigram, its subject is too strong, and coming under THE yf KING."

    "raw_text": "Tff K wang indicates that (under the conditions which it symbolises) it will be advantageous to be firm and correct. the necessity of the time requires superior men to withdraw before them.’ Yet the auspice of Thun is not all bad. By firm correct ness the threatened evil may be arrested to a small extent. ‘ A retiring tail ’ seems to suggest the idea of the subject of the lines hurrying away, which would only aggravate the evil and danger of the time. ‘ His purpose ’ in line 2 is the purpose to withdraw. The weak 2 responds correctly to the strong 5, and both are central. The purpose therefore is symbolled as in the text. The ‘yellow’ colour of the ox is introduced because of its being 1 correct,’ and of a piece with the central place of the line. Line 3 has no proper correlate in 6; and its subject allows himself to be entangled and impeded by the subjects of 1 and 2. He is too familiar with them, and they presume, and fetter his movements;—compare Analects, 17.25. He should keep them at a distance. Line 4 has a correlate in 1, and is free to exercise the decision belonging to its subject. The line is the first in ZAien, symbolic of strength. In the Shfi, IV, v, Section 2.9, the worthy! Yin is made to say, ' The minister will not for favour or gain continue in an office whose work is done;’ and the Khang-hsl editors refer to his words as an illustration of what is said on line 5. It has its correlate in 2, and its subject carries out the purpose to retire ‘in an admirable way.’ Line 6 is strong, and with no correlate to detain it in 3, Its subject vigorously and happily carries out the idea of the hexagram. 1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject manifesting his strength in his toes. But advance will lead to evil—most certainly. 2. The second line, undivided, shows that with firm correctness there will be good fortune. 3. The third line, undivided, shows, in the case of a small man, one using all his strength; and in the case of a superior man, one whose rule is not to do so. Even with firm correctness the position would be perilous. (The exercise of strength in it might be compared to the case of) a ram butting against a fence, and getting his horns entangled. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows (a case in which) firm correctness leads to good fortune, and occasion for repentance disappears. (We see) the fence opened without the horns being entangled. The strength is like that in the wheel-spokes of a large waggon. 5. The fifth line, divided, shows one who loses his ram(-like strength) in the ease of his position. (But) there will be no occasion for repentance. 6.

Line x is strong, in its correct place, and also the first line in Z/rien, the hexagram of strength, and the first line in Ta Zwang, The idea of the figure might seem to be concentrated in it; and hence we have it symbolised by ‘strength in the toes,’ or ‘advancing.’ But such a measure is too bold to be undertaken by one in the lowest place, and moreover there is no proper correlate in 4. Hence comes the evil auspice. Line 2 is strong, but the strength is tempered by its being in an even place, instead of being excited by it, as might be feared. Then the place is that in the centre. With firm correctness there will be good fortune, Line 3 is strong, and in its proper place. It is at the top more over of ZZen, A small man so symbolled will use his strength to the utmost; but not so the superior man.

XXXV. 1 he Thwan of this hexagram expresses its subject more fully and plainly than that of any of the previous thirty-four, It is about a feudal prince whose services to the country have made him acceptable to his king. The king’s favour has been shown to him by gifts and personal attentions such as form the theme of more than one ode in the Shih; see especially III, iii, y. The symbolism of the lines dimly indicates the qualities of such a prince. Bin means ‘ to advance.’ Hexagrams 46 and 53 agree with this in being called by names that indicate progress and ad vance. The advance in Bin is like that of the sun, ‘the shining light, shining more and more to the perfect day.’ Line 1 is weak, and in the lowest place, and its correlate in 4 is neither central nor in its correct position. This indicates the small and obstructed beginnings of his subject. But by his firm correct ness he pursues the way to good fortune; and though the king does not yet believe in him, he the more pursues his noble course. Line 2 is weak, and its correlate in 5 is also weak. Its subject therefore has still to mourn in obscurity. But his position is central and correct, and he holds on his way, till success comes ere long. The symbolism says he receives it ‘from his grand mother;’ and readers will be startled by the extraordinary state ment, as I was when I first read it. Literally the Text says ‘the king's mother/ as P, Regis rendered it,—‘ Istam magnam felicitatem a matre regis recipit.’ He also tries to give the name a historical referenceto TMi-A'iang, the grandmother of king Wan; Thdi- ^hn, his mother; or to Thdi-sze, hi9 wife, and the mother of king Wfi and the duke of A!u, all famous in Chinese history, and cele brated in the Shih. But ‘Icing’s father’ and ‘king’s mother’ are well-known Chinese appellations for ‘grandfather’ and ‘grand mother.’ This is the view given on the passage, by Alang-jze, Affi HsJ, and the Khang-hsi editors, the latter of whom, indeed, account for the use of the name, instead of ‘deceased mother/ which we find in hexagram 62, by the regulations observed in the ancestral temple. These authorities, moreover, all agree in saying that the name points us to line 5, the correlate of 2, and ‘the lord of the hexagram.’ Now the subject of line g is the sovereign, who at length acknowledges the worth of the feudal lord, and gives him *34",

Canon McClatchie has a very astonishing note on the name, which he renders ‘Imperial Mother’ (p. 164):—‘That is, the wife of Imperial Heaven (Juno), who occupies the “ throne of the dia gram,\" viz. the fifth stroke, which is soft and therefore feminine.

Appendix VI merely says that the advance set forth in 35 is sure to meet with wounding, and hence Bin is followed by Ming L Line x is strong, and in its right place;—its subject should be going forward. But the general signification of the hexagram supposes him to be wounded. The wound, however, being re ceived at the very commencement of its action, is but slight. And hence comes the emblem of a bird hurt so as to be obliged to droop its wings. The subject then appears directly as ‘ the supe rior man. 1 He sees it to be his course to desist from the stri^gle for a time, and is so rapt in the thought that he can fast for three days and not think of it. When he does withdraw, opposition follows him; but it is implied that he holds on to his own good purpose. Line 2 is weak, but also in its right place, and central; giving us the idea of an officer, obedient to duty and the right.

It fitly represents the wife, and what is said on it tells us of her special sphere and duty; and that she should be unassuming in regard to all beyond her sphere; always being firm and correct. See the Shih, III, 350. Line 3 is strong, and in an odd place. If the place were central, the strength would be tempered; but the subject of the line, in the topmost place of the trigram, may be expected to exceed in severity. But severity is not a bad thing in regulating a familyit is better than laxity and indulgence. Line 4 is weak, and in its proper place. The wife is again suggested to us,, and we are told, that notwithstanding her being confined to the internal affairs of the household, she can do much to enrich the family. The subject of the strong fifth line appears as the king.

    "raw_text": "In (the state indicated by) ATien advantage will be found in the south-west, and the contrary in the north-east. It will be advantageous (also) to meet may overcome their evil, and at least it will help to silence their slanderous tongues. Line 5 is weak, and its subject is the proper correlate of the strong 2. They might meet openly; but for the separation and disunion that mark the time. A casual, as it were a stolen, inter view, as in a bye-lane or passage, however will be useful, and may lead on to a better understanding. Line 3 is weak, where it ought to be strong, Its correlate, how ever, in 6 is strong, and the relation between them might seem what it ought to be. But the weak 3 is between the strong lines in 2 and 4; and in a time of disunion there ensue the checking and repulsion emblemed in the Text. At the same time the subject of line 6 inflicts on that of 3 the punishments which are mentioned. It is thus bad for 3 at first, but we are told that in the end it will be well with him; and this will be due to the strength of the sixth line. The conclusion grows out of a conviction in the mind of the author that what is right and good is destined to triumph over what is wrong and bad. Disorder shall in the long run give place to order, and disunion to union. Line 4 has no proper correlate, and might seem to be solitary. But, as we saw on line 1, in this hexagram, correlates of the same class help each other. Hence the subjects of 4 and 1, meeting together, work with good will and success. The place of 5 is odd, but the line itself is weak, so that there might arise occasion for repentance. But the strong 2 is a proper correlate to the weak 5. Five being the sovereign's place, the sub ject of 2 is styled the sovereign’s relative, of the same surname with the great man. (In these circumstances), with firmness and correctness, there will be good fortune. 1. From the first line, divided, we learn that advance (on the part of its subject) will lead to (greater) difficulties, while remaining stationary will afford ground for praise. 2. The second line, divided, shows the minister of the king struggling with difficulty on difficulty, and not with a view to his own advantage. 3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject advancing, (but only) to (greater) difficulties. Fie remains stationary, and returns (to his former associates). 4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject advancing, (but only) to (greater) difficulties. He remains stationary, and unites (with the subject of the line above). 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject struggling with the greatest difficulties, while friends are coming to help him. 6. The topmost line, divided, shows its subject going forward, (only to increase) the difficulties, with him, and head of some branch of the descendants of the royal house.. It is as easy for 5, so supported, to deal with the disunion of the time, as to bite through a piece of skin. Line 6 is an even place, and yet the line is strong;—what can its subject effect ? He looks at 3, which, as weak, is a proper correlate; but he looks with the evil eye of disunion. The subject of 3 appears no better than a filthy pig, nor more real than an impossible carriage-load of ghosts. He bends his bow against him, but he unbends it, discovering a friend in 3, as 1 did in 4, and 5 in 2. He acts and with good luck, comparable to the falling rain, which results from the happy union of the yang and yin in nature. while his remaining stationary will be (productive of) great (merit). There will be good fortune, and it will be advantageous to meet with the great man. XXXIX. Wien is the symbol for incompetency in the feet and legs, involving difficulty in walking; hence it is used in this hexa gram to indicate a state of the kingdom which makes the government of it an arduous task. How this task may be successfully performed, now by activity on the part of the ruler, and now by a discreet inactivity:—this is what the figure teaches, or at least gives hints about. For the development of the meaning of the symbolic character from the structure of the lineal figure, see Appendixes I and II. The Thwan seems to require three things—attention to place, the presence of the great man, and the firm observance of cor rectness—in order to cope successfully with the difficulties of the situation. The first thing is enigmatically expressed, and the lan guage should be compared with what we find in the Thwan of hexagrams 2 and 40. Referring to Figure 2, in Plate III, we find that, according to Wan’s arrangement of the trigrams, the south west is occupied by Ivhwan ( . i, and the north-east by Afan (in =“)■ The former represents the champaign country; the latter, the mountainous region. The former is easily traversed and held; the latter, with difficulty. The attention to place thus becomes transformed into a calculation of circumstances ; those that promise success in an enterprise, which should be taken advan tage of, and those that threaten difficulty and failure, which should be shunned. This is the generally accepted view of this difficult passage. The Khang-hsf editors have a view of their own. I have been myself inclined to find less symbolism in it, and to take the south west as the regions in the south and west of the kingdom, which we know from the Shih were more especially devoted to Wan and his house, while the strength of the kings of Shang lay in the north and east. ‘The idea of “the great man,\" Mencius’s “minister of Heaven/\" is illustrated by the strong line in the fifth place, having for its cor relate the weak line in 2. But favourableness of circumstances and place, and the presence cf the great man do not dispense from the observance of firm correctness. Throughout these essays of the Yi this is always insisted on.

Line x is weak, whereas it ought to be strong as being in an odd place, If its subject advance, he will not be able to cope with the difficulties of the situation, but be overwhelmed by them. Let him wait for a more favourable time. Line 2 is weak, but in its proper place. Its correlation with the strong 5, and consequent significance, are well set forth. Line 3 is strong, and in a place of strength; but its correlate in 6 is weak, so that the advance of its subject would be unsupported. He waits therefore for a better time, and cherishes the subjects of the two lines below, who naturally cling to him. Line 4 is weak, and, though in its proper place, its subject could do little of himself, He is immediately below the king or great man, however, and cultivates his loyal attachment to him, waiting for the time when he shall be required to act. Line 5 is the king, the man great and strong. He can cope with the difficulties, and the subjects of 2 and the other lines of the lower trigram give their help.

Nolhingissaidin the Thwan about the discountenancing and removal of small men,—unworthy ministers or officers; but that subject appears in more than one of the lines. There is a weak line, instead of a strong, in the first place; but this is compensated for by its strong correlate in 4. M Hsi says he does not understand the symbolism under line 2. The place is even, but the line itself is strong; the strength there fore is modified or tempered. And 2 is the correlate of the ruler in 5. We are to look to its subject therefore for a minister striving to realise the idea of the hexagram, and pacify the subdued king dom. He becomes a hunter, and disposes of unworthy men, represented by 'the three foxes.’ He also gets the yellow arrows,— the instruments used in war or in hunting, whose colour is ‘correct,’ and whose form is ‘ straight.’ His firm correctness will be good. Line 3 is weak, when it should be strong; and occupying, as it does, the topmost place of the lower trigram, it suggests the symbolism of a porter in a carriage. People will say, ‘ How did he get there f The things cannot be his own.’ And robbers will attack and plunder him. The subject of the line cannot protect himself, nor accomplish anything good. What is said on the fourth line appears in the form of an address to its subject, The line is strong in an even place, and 1, its corre late, is weak in an odd place. Such a union will not be productive of good. In the symbolism 1 becomes the toe of the subject of 4. How the friend or friends, who are to come to him on the removal of this toe, are represented, I do not perceive. Line 5 is weak in an odd place; but the place is that of the ruler, to whom it belongs to perfect the idea of the hexagram by SECT. II. THE SUN HEXAGRAM, I 47 • movement that shall be made. In what shall this (sincerity in the exercise of Sun) be employed? (Even) in sacrifice two baskets of grain, (though there be nothing else), may be presented. 1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject suspending his own affairs, and hurrying away (to help the subject of the fourth line). He will commit no error, but let him consider how far he should contribute of what is his (for the other). 2. The second line, undivided, shows that it will be advantageous for its subject to maintain a firm correctness, and that action on his part will be evil. He can give increase (to his correlate) without taking from himself. 3. The third line, divided, shows how of three men walking together, the number is diminished by one; and how one, walking, finds his friend. 4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject diminishing the ailment under which he labours by making (the subject of the first line) hasten (to his help), and make him glad.

It will be his duty to remove especially all the small men represented by the divided lines, which he can do with the help of his strong correlate in 2. Then even the small men will change their ways, and repair to him.

The interpretation of this hexagram is encompassed with great difficulties. Sun is the symbol for the idea of diminishing or diminution; and what is said in Appendix I has made it to be accepted as teaching the duty of the subject to take of what is his and contribute to his ruler, or the expenses of the govern ment under which he lives; in other words, readily and cheerfully to pay his taxes. P. Regis says, ‘Sun seu (vectigalis causa) minuere .... est valde utileand Canon McClajtchie in translating Appendix I has‘Diminishing (by taxation for instance) . , , . is very lucky,' Possibly, king Wan may have seen in the figures the subject of taxation; but the symbolism of his son takes a much wider range. My own reading of the figure and Text comes near to the view of JOang-^ze, that ‘ every diminution and repression of what we have in excess to bring it into accordance with right and reason is comprehended under Sun.’ Let there be sincerity in doing this, and it will lead to the happiest results. It will lead to great success in great things; and if the correction, or it may be a contribution towards it, appear to be very small, yet it will be accepted;—as in the most solemn religious service. This is substantially the view of the hexagram approved by the I(hang-hsi editors. Line 1 is strong, and its correlate in 4 is weak. Its subject will wish to help the subject of 4; but will not leave anything of his own undone in doing so. Nor will he diminish of his own for the other without due deliberation. Line 2 is strong, and in the central place. But it is in the place of a weak line, and its subject should maintain his position without moving to help his correlate in 5. Maintaining his own firm cor- redness is the best way to help him. Paragraph 3 is to my mind full of obscurity.

Two indications are evident in the lines;—the strong line in the ruler’s seat, or the fifth line, and the weak line in the correlative place of 2. ■ Whether there be other indications in the figure or its component trigrams will be considered in dealing with the Appendixes. The writer might well say, on general grounds, of the ruler whom he had in mind, that he would be suc cessful in his enterprises and overcome the greatest difficulties. Line 1 is strong, but its low position might seem to debar its sub ject from any great enterprise. Favoured as he is, however, according to the general idea of the hexagram, and specially responding to the proper correlate in 4, it is natural that he should make a movement, and great success will make his rashness be forgotten. With paragraph 2 compare paragraph 5 of the preceding hexa gram. Line 2 is weak, but in the centre, and is the correlate of 5 . Friends give its subject the valuable gifts mentioned; ‘that is,’ says Kwo Yung (Sung dynasty), ‘men benefit him; the oracles of the divination are in his favour,—spirits, that is, benefit him; and finally, when the king sacrifices to God, He accepts. Heaven confers benefit from above.’ Line 3 is weak, neither central, nor in its correct position. It would seem therefore that its subject should have no increase given to him. But it is the time for giving increase, and the idea of his receiving it by means of evil things is put into the line. That such things serve for reproof and correction is well known to Chinese moralists. But the paragraph goes on also to caution and admonish. Line 4 is the place for a minister, near to that of the ruler. Its subject is weak, but his place is appropriate, and as he follows the THE YJ KING. pathy and support), with a consciousness of the peril (involved in cutting off the criminal). He should (also) make announcement in his own city, and show that it will not be well to have recourse at once to arms. (In this way) there will be advantage in whatever he shall go forward to. 1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject in (the pride of) strength advancing with his toes. He goes forward, but will not succeed. There will be ground for blame. 2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject full of apprehension and appealing (for sympathy and help). Late at night hostile measures may be (taken against him), but he need not be anxious about them. 3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject (about to advance) with strong (and determined) looks. There will be evil, (But) the superior man, bent on cutting off (the criminal), will walk alone and encounter the rain, (till he be hated by his proper associates) as if he were contaminated (by the others). (In the end) there will be no blame against him. due course, his ruler will listen to him, and he will be a support in the most critical movements. Changing the capital from place to place was frequent in the feudal times of China. That of Shang, which preceded ifau, was changed five times. Line 5 is strong, in its fitting position, and central. It is the seat of the ruler, who has his proper correlate in 2. Everything good, according to the conditions of the hexagram, therefore, may be said of him ;~as is done. Line 6 is also strong; but it should be weak. Occupying the topmost place of the figure, its subject will concentrate his powers in the increase of himself, and not think of benefiting those below him j and the consequence will be as described.

(If he could act) like a sheep led (after its companions), occasion for repentance would disappear. But though he hear these words, he will not believe them. 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows (the small men like) a bed of purslain, which ought to be uprooted with the utmost determination. (The subject of the line having such determination), his action, in harmony with his central position, will lead to no error or blame. 6. The sixth line, divided, shows its subject with out any (helpers) on whom to call. His end will be evil. XLIII. In Kwai we have the hexagram of the third month, when the last remnant, cold and dark, of winter, represented by the sixth line, is about to disappear before the advance of the warm and bright days of the approaching summer. In the yin line at the top king Win saw the symbol of a small or bad man, a feudal prince or high minister, lending his power to maintain a corrupt government, or, it might be, a dynasty that was waxen old and ready to vanish away; and in the five undivided lines he saw the representatives of good order, or, it might be, the dynasty which was to supersede the other. This then is the subject of the hexa gram,—how bad men, statesmen corrupt and yet powerful, are to be put out of the way. And he who would accomplish the task must do so by the force of his character more than by force of arms, and by producing a general sympathy on bis side. The Thwan says that he must openly denounce the criminal in the court, seek to awaken general sympathy, and at the same time go about his enterprise, conscious of its difficulty, and danger. Among his own adherents, moreover, as if it were in his own city, he must make it understood how unwillingly he takes up arms. Then let him go forward, and success will attend him.

Its subject had better not take the field. Line 2 is strong, and central, and its subject is possessed with the determination to do his part in the work of removal. But his eagerness is tempered by his occupancy of an even place; and he is cautious, and no attempts, however artful, to harm him will take effect. Line 3 is strong, and its subject displays his purpose too eagerly, Being beyond the central position, moreover, gives an indication of evil. Lines 3 and 6 are also proper correlates; and, as elsewhere in the Yi, the meeting of yin and yang lines is associated with falling rain, The subject of 3, therefore, communicates with 6, in a way that annoys his associates; but nevertheless he commits no error, and, in the end, incurs no blame. Line 4 is not in the centre, nor in an odd place, appropriate to it as undivided. Its subject therefore will not be at rest, nor able to do anything to accomplish the idea of the hexagram. He is sym bolised by a culprit, who, according to the ancient and modern custom of Chinese courts, has been bastinadoed till he presents the appearance in the Text. Alone he can do nothing; if he could follow others, like a sheep led along, he might accomplish some thing, but he will not listen to advice. Purslain grows in shady places, and hence we find it here in close contiguity to the topmost line, which is yin. As 5 is the ruler’s seat, evil may come to him from such contiguity, and strenuous efforts must be made to prevent such an evil. The subject of the line, the ruler in the central place, will commit no error. It must be allowed that the symbolism in this line is not easily managed. The subject of the 6th line, standing alone, may be easily dis posed of. 1. The first line, divided, shows how its subject should be kept (like a carriage) tied and fastened to a metal drag, in which case with firm correctness there will be good fortune. (But) if he move in any direction, evil will appear. He will be (like) a lean pig, which is sure to keep jumping about. 2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject with a wallet of fish. There will be no error. But it will not be well to let (the subject of the first line) go forward to the guests. 3. The third line, undivided, shows one from whose buttocks the skin has been stripped so that he walks with difficulty. The position is perilous, but there will be no great error. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject with his wallet, but no fish in it. This will give rise to evil. 5. The fifth line, undivided, (shows its subject as) a medlar tree overspreading the gourd (beneath it). If he keep his brilliant qualities concealed, (a good issue) will descend (as) from Heaven. 6. The sixth line, undivided, shows its subject receiving others on his horns. There will be occa sion for regret, but there will be no error. XLIV.

It will be advan- of the country, His influence, if unchecked, would go on to grow, and he would displace one good man after another, and fill the vacant seats with others like-minded with himself. The object of Wan in his Thwan, therefore, was to enjoin resistance to the encroachment of this had man. Kau is defined as giving the idea of suddenly and casually encountering or meeting with, So does the divided line appear all at once in the figure. And this significance of the name rules in the interpretation of the lines, so as to set on one side the more common interpretation of them according to the correlation; showing how the meaning of the figures was put into them from the minds of Wan and Tan in the first place. The sentiments of the Text are not learned from them; but they are forced and twisted, often fantastically, and made to appear to give those sentiments forth of themselves. Here the first line, divided, where it ought to be the contrary, becomes the symbol of a bold, bad woman, who appears unex pectedly on the scene, and wishes to subdue or win all the five strong lines to herself. No one would contract a marriage with such a female; and every good servant of his country will try to repel the entrance into the government of every officer who can be so symbolised. Line 1 represents the bete noire of the figure. If its subject can be kept back, the method of firm government and order will j proceed. If he cannot be restrained, he will become disgusting ! and dangerous. It is not enough for the carriage to be stopt by the metal drag; it is also tied or bound to some steadfast object. Internal and external restraints should be opposed to the . [ bad man.

The use of great victims will conduce to good fortune; and in whatever direction movement is made, it will be advantageous. 1. The first line, divided, shows its subject with a sincere desire (for union), but unable to carry it out, so that disorder is brought into the sphere of his union. If he cry out (for help to his proper correlate), all at once (his tears) will give place subject of line 1. It has come into the possession of the subject of 2, by virtue of the meaning of the name Kau, which I have pointed out. With his strength therefore he can repress the advance of 1. He becomes in fact 1 the lord of the hexagram,’ and all the other strong lines are merely guests; and especially is it important that he should prevent 1 from approaching them. This is a common explanation of what is said under this second line. It seems far fetched ; but I can neither find nor devise anything better. With what is said on line 3, compare the fourth paragraph of the duke’s Text on the preceding hexagram. Line 3 is strong, but has gone beyond the central place; has no correlate above; and is cut off from 1 by the intervening 2. It cannot do much therefore against 1; but its aim being to repress that, there will be no great error. Line r is the proper correlate of 4 ; but it has already met and associated with 2. The subject of 4 therefore stands alone; and evil to him may be looked for. Line 5 is strong, and in the ruler’s place. Its relation to 1 is like that of a forest tree to the spreading gourd. But let not its subject use force to destroy or repress the growth of 1; but let him restrain himself and keep his excellence concealed, and Heaven will set its seal to his virtue. The symbolism of line 6 is difficult to understand, though the meaning of what is said is pretty clear.

If he go forward, he will not err, though there may be some small cause for regret. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject in such a state that, if he be greatly fortunate, he will receive no blame. 5.

Line 1 is weak, and in the place of a strong line. It has a proper correlate in 4, but is separated from him by the intervention of two weak lines. The consequence of these things is supposed to be expressed in the first part of the symbolism; but the subject of the line is possessed by the desire for union, which is the theme of the hexagram. Calling out to his correlate for help, he obtains it, and his sorrow is turned into joy. Line 2 is in its proper place, and responds to the strong ruler in 5, who encourages and helps the advance of its subject. He possesses also the sincerity, proper to him in his central position; and though he were able to offer only the sacrifice of the spring, small compared with the fulness of the sacrifices in summer and autumn, it would be accepted. Line 3 is weak, in the place of a strong line, and advanced from the central place. The topmost line, moreover, is no proper correlate. But its subject is possessed by the desire for union; and though 2 and 4 decline to associate with him, he presses on to 6, which is also desirous of union. That common desire brings them together, notwithstanding 3 and 6 are both divided lines; and with difficulty the subject of 3 accomplishes his object. [But that an ordinary rule for interpreting the lineal indications may be thus overruled by extraordinary considerations shows how much of fancy there is in the symbolism or in the commentaries on it.] Line 4 has its correlate in 1, and is near to the ruling line in 5.

Then the ruler’s seat, the fifth place, is occupied by a divided line, indi cating that he will welcome the advance of 2. The officer therefore both has the qualities that fit him to advance, and a favourable opportunity to do so. The result of his advance will be fortunate. It is said that after he has met with the ruler, ‘ the great man ’ in 5, ‘ advance to the south will be fortunate.’ Affi Hst and other critics say that ‘ advancing to the south ’ is equivalent simply to ‘ advancing forwards.’ The south is the region of brightness and warmth; advance towards it will be a joyful progress, As P. Regis explains the phrase, the traveller will proceed ‘via recta simillima illi qua itur ad austrates felicesque plagas.’ Line 1 is weak, where it should be strong; its subject, that is, is humble and docile. Those above him, therefore, welcome his advance. Another interpretation of the line is suggested by Appen dix I; which deserves consideration. As the first line of Sun, moreover, it may be supposed to concentrate in itself its attribute of docility, and be the lord of the trigram. See on the second line of 3 b u i. Line 2 is strong, and the weak 5 is its proper correlate. We have a strong officer serving a weak ruler; he could not do so unless he were penetrated with a sincere and devoted loyalty. Paragraph 3 describes the boldness and fearlessness of the advance of the third line. According to the Khang-hst editors, who, I think, are right, there is a shade of condemnation in the line. Its subject is too bold. Line 4 occupies the place of a great minister, in immediate con tiguity to his ruler, who confides in him, and raises him to the highest distinction as a feudal prince. The mention of mount correct, the (really) great man, there will be good fortune. He will fall into no error. If he make speeches, his words cannot be made good. 1. The first line, divided, shows its subject with bare buttocks straitened under the stump of a tree. He enters a dark valley, and for three years has no prospect (of deliverance). 2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject straitened amidst his wine and viands, There come to him anon the red knee-covers (of the ruler). It will be well for him (to maintain his sincerity as) in sacrificing. Active operations (on his part) will lead to evil, but he will be free from blame. 3. The third line, divided, shows its subject straitened before a (frowning) rock. He lays hold of thorns. He enters his palace, and does not see his wife, There will be evil. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject proceeding very slowly (to help the subject of the first line), who is straitened by the carriage adorned with metal in front of him. There will be occasion for regret, but the end will be good. Kh\\ y at the foot of which was the capital of the lords of Aau, seems to take the paragraph out of the sphere of symbolism into that of history, ‘The king’ in it is the last sovereign of Shang; the feudal prince in it is Wan. In line 5 the advance has reached the highest point of dignity, and firm correctness is specially called for. ‘ Ascending the steps of a stair may intimate, as Wu Hsi says, the ease of the advance; or according to others (the Khang-hst editors among them), its ceremonious manner. What can the subject of the hexagram want more ? He has gained all his wishes, and still he is for going onwards. His advance is blind and foolish; and only the most exact correctness will save him from the consequences. SECT. II. THE KHWAN HEXAGRAM. 1 63 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject with his nose and feet cut off. He is straitened by (his ministers in their) scarlet aprons. He is leisurely in his movements, however, and is satisfied. It will be well for him to be (as sincere) as in sacrificing (to spiritual beings). 6 . The sixth line, divided, shows its subject strait ened, as if bound with creepers; or in a high and dangerous position, and saying (to himself), ‘If I move, I shall repent it.' If he do repent of former errors, there will be good fortune in his going forward. XLVII. The character Khwan presents us with the picture of a tree within an enclosure; ‘ a plant,’ according to Williams, ‘ fading for want of room; ’ ‘a tree,’ according to Tai Tung, ‘not allowed to spread its branches.’ However this be, the term conveys the idea of being straitened and distressed; and this hexagram indicates a state of things in which the order and government that would conduce to the well-being of the country can hardly get the develop ment, which, by skilful management on the part of ‘the great man' and others, is finally secured for them. Looking at the figure we see that the two central places are occupied by strong lines; but 2 is confined between 1 and 3, both of which are weak, and g (the ruler), as well as 4 (his minister), is covered by the weak 6; all which peculiarities are held to indicate the repression or straitening of good men by bad. For the way in which the same view is derived from the great symbolism, see Appendix II, in loc. The concluding sentence of the Th wan is literally, ‘ If he speak, he will not be believed; ’ but the Khang-hsi editors give sufficient reasons for changing one character so as to give the meaning in the translation. ‘ Actions,’ not words, are what are required in the case, The symbolism of ‘ buttocks' is rather a favourite with the duke of Aauchacun a son gofit.’ The poor subject of line 1 sitting on a mere stump, which affords him no shelter, is indeed badly off.

The character Khwan presents us with the picture of a tree within an enclosure; ‘ a plant,’ according to Williams, ‘ fading for want of room; ’ ‘a tree,’ according to Tai Tung, ‘not allowed to spread its branches.’ However this be, the term conveys the idea of being straitened and distressed; and this hexagram indicates a state of things in which the order and government that would conduce to the well-being of the country can hardly get the develop ment, which, by skilful management on the part of ‘the great man' and others, is finally secured for them.

The three strong lines in the figure (2, 4, and 5) are all held to represent‘ superior men; ’ and their being straitened is not in their persons or estates, but in their principles which are denied develop ment. Hence the subject of 2 is straitened while he fares sumptu ously. His correlate in 5, though not quite proper, occupies the ruler's place, and comes to his help. That it is the ruler who comes appears from his red or vermillion knee-covers, different from the scarlet knee-covers worn by nobles, as in paragraph 5. Let 2 cultivate his sincerity and do the work of the hexagram as if he were sacrificing to spiritual beings; and then, if he keep quiet, all will be well. For ‘ a full explanation ’ of paragraph 3 Zfi Hsi refers his readers to what Confucius is made to say on it in Appendix III, ii, 35, The reader, however, will probably not find much light in that passage. The Khang-hst editors say hereThe subjects of the three divided lines (1,3, and 6) are all unable to deal aright with the straitened state indicated by the figure. The first is at the bottom, sitting and distressed. The second, occupies the third place, where he may either advanqe or retreat; and he advances and is distressed. Wounded abroad, he returns to his family, and finds none to receive him; so graphically is there set forth the distress which reckless action brings.’ f Line 4 is the proper correlate of 1, but it is a strong line in an even place, and its assistance is given dilatorily. Then 1 is over- j ridden by 2, which is represented by ‘ a chariot of metal,’ It is difficult for the subjects of 1 and 4 to come together, and effect much; but 4 is near 5, which is also a strong line.

Line 6 is at the top of the figure, where the distress may be supposed to reach its height. Its subject appears bound and on a perilous summit. But his extremity is also his opportunity.

Its form is what I have seen in the plains of northern China; what may be seen among ourselves in many places in Europe. It is deep, and the water is drawn up by a vessel let down from the top; and the value of the well depends on the water being actually raised.

It is assumed in the Thwan that change is viewed by people generally with suspicion and dislike, and should not be made hastily. When made as a necessity, and its good effects appear, the issues will be great and good. A proved necessity for them beforehand; and a firm correctness in the conduct of them:—these are the conditions by which changes should be regulated.

At least ‘ there is no mistake.’ The above is what is found in the best commentaries on the paragraph. I give it, but am myself dis satisfied with it, Line 2 is strong. ‘ The enemy ’ is the first line, which solicits 1. One, however, is able to resist the solicitation; and the whole paragraph gives a good auspice. The personal pronoun seems to show that the whole was, or was intended to be, understood as an oracular response in divination. This paragraph is rhymed, more over, as are also i, 3, and 4;— ‘ In the caldron is good fare, See my foe with angry glare; But touch me he does not dare.’ Line 3 is also strong, and in the proper place; and if its corre late were the divided 5, its auspice would be entirely good.

When the move ment (like a crash of thunder) terrifies all within a hundred li, he will be (like the sincere worshipper) who is not (startled into) letting go his ladle and (cup of) sacrificial spirits. 1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject, when the movement approaches, looking out and around with apprehension, and afterwards smiling and talking cheerfully. There will be good fortune. 2. The second line, divided, shows its subject, when the movement approaches, in a position of peril. He judges it better to let go the articles (in his possession), and to ascend a very lofty height, There is no occasion for him to pursue after (the things he has let go); in seven days he will find them. 3. The third line, divided, shows its subject dis traught amid the startling movements going on, If those movements excite him to (right) action, there will be no mistake. himself for his work, and he has no sufficient help; and the result will be evil. ‘ Paragraph 5,’ says the Daily Lecture, ‘ praises the ruler as con descending to the worthy with his humble virtue.’ 1 Yellow’ has occurred repeatedly as ‘a correct colour;' and here ‘the yellow ears and strong rings of metal ’ are intended to intensify our appre ciation of the occupant of 5. As the line is divided, a caution is added about being firm and correct. Line 6 is strong, but the strength is tempered by its being in an even place. It is this which makes the handle to be of jade, which, though very hard, is supposed to have a peculiar and rich softness of its own. The auspice of the line is very good. ‘The great minister,’ it is said, ‘ the subject of 6,’ performs for the ruler, the subject of 5, in helping his government and nourishing the worthy, the part which the handle does for the caldron. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject, amid the startling movements, supinely sinking (deeper) in the mud. 5. The fifth line, divided, shows its subject going and coming amidst the startling movements (of the time), and always in peril; but perhaps he will not incur loss, and find business (which he can accomplish). b. The topmost line, divided, shows its subject, amidst the startling movements (of the time), in breathless dismay and looking round him with trembling apprehension. If he take action, there will be evil. If, while the startling movements have not reached his own person and his neighbourhood, (he were to take precautions), there would be no error, though his relatives might (still) speak against him. LI. Zan among the trigrams represents thunder, and, according to Wan’s arrangement and significance of them, ‘ the oldest son.’ It is a phonetic character in which the significant constituent is Yu, meaning rain, and with which are formed most characters that denote atmospherical phenomena. The hexagram is formed of the trigram Zhn redoubled, and may be taken as representing the crash or peal of thunder; but we have seen that the attribute or virtue of the trigram is 'moving, exciting power;’ and thence, symbolically, the character is indicative of movement taking place in society or in the kingdom. This is the meaning of the hexagram; and the subject is the conduct to be pursued in a time of movement—such as insurrection or revolution—by the party promoting, and most interested in, the situation. It is shown how he ought to be aware of the dangers of the time, and how by precaution and the regula tion of himself he may overcome them, The indication of a successful issue given by the figure is sup posed to be given by the undivided line at the bottom of the trigram. The subject of it must be superior to the subjects of the two divided lines above. It is in the idea of the hexagram that he should be moving and advancing;—and what can his movement be but successful ? LI I, The Kan Hexagram. When one’s resting is like that of the back, and he loses all consciousness of self; when he walks The next sentence shows him sensible of the danger of the occasion, but confident and self-possessed. The concluding sen tence shows him rapt in his own important affairs, like a sincere worshipper, thinking only of the service in which he is engaged. Such a symbol is said to be suggested by Wan’s significance of K an as ' the oldest son (page 33).’ It is his to succeed to his father, and the hexagram, as following Ting, shows him presiding over the sacrifices that have been prepared in the caldron. This is too fanciful. What is said on line 1 is little more than a repetition of the principal part of the Th wan. The line is undivided, and gives the auspice of good fortune. ‘ The position of peril ’ to the subject of line 2 is suggested, as Appendix II says, by its position, immediately above r. But the rest of the symbolism is obscure, and Zu Hsi says he does not understand it. The common interpretation appears in the version. The subject of the line does what he can to get out of danger; and finally, as is signified by the central position of the line, the issue is better than could have been expected, On the specification of ‘ seven days,’ see what is said in the treatise on the Thwan of hexagram 24. On its use here ZAang-jze says:—‘The places of a diagram amount to 6. The number 7 is the first of another. When the movement symbolised by Zan is gone by, things will be as they were before.’ Line 3 is divided, and where an undivided line should be; but if its subject move on to the fourth place, which would be right foi him, the issue will not be bad. The 4th line, however, has a bad auspice of its own. It is undi vided in an even place, and it is pressed by the divided line on in his courtyard, and does not see any (of the per sons) in it,—there will be no error. 1. The first line, divided, shows its subject keep ing his toes at rest. There will be no error; but it will be advantageous for him to be persistently firm and correct. 2. The second line, divided, shows its subject keeping the calves of his legs at rest. He cannot help (the subject of the line above) whom he fol lows, and is dissatisfied in his mind. 3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject keeping his loins at rest, and separating the ribs (from the body below). The situation is perilous, and the heart glows with suppressed excitement. 4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject keeping his trunk at rest. There will be no error. 5. 1 he fifth line, divided, shows its subject keep ing his jawbones at rest, so that his words are (all) orderly. Occasion for repentance will disappear. 6. The sixth line, undivided, shows its subject either side, hence its subject is represented as supinely sinking in the mud. Line g is divided, in an odd place, and that in which the action of the hexagram may be supposed to be concentrated. Hence its subject is always in peril; but his central position indicates safety in the end. Line 6 is weak, and has to abide the concluding terrors of the movement. Action on the part of its subject is sure to be evil, If, however, he were to take precautions, he might escape with only the censures of his relatives, But I do not see anything in the figure to indicate this final symbolism. The writer, probably, had a case in his mind, which it suited; but what that was we do devotedly maintaining his restfulness. There will be good fortune. LII. The trigram Kan represents a mountain. Mountains rise up grandly from the surface of the earth, and their masses rest on it in quiet and solemn majesty; and they serve also to arrest the on ward progress of the traveller. Hence the attribute ascribed to Kan is twofold; it is both active and passive—resting and arresting. The character is used in this hexagram with both of those signifi cations. As the name of the figure, it denotes the mental charac teristic of resting in what is right; especially resting, as it is expressed by Chinese critics, ‘ in principle,'—that which is right, on the widest scale, and in the absolute conception of the mind; and that which is right in every different position in which a man can be placed. We find this treated of in the Great Learning (Commentary, chapter 3), and in the Doctrine of the Mean, chapter 14, and other places. This is the theme of the hexa gram ; and the symbolism of it is all taken from different parts of the human body, as in hexagram 31, and the way in which they are dealt with. Several of the paragraphs are certainly not easy to translate and interpret. The other parts of the body, such as the mouth, eyes, and ears, have their appetencies, which lead them to what is without them selves. The back alone has nothing to do with anything beyond itself—hardly with itself even; all that it has to do is to stand straight and strong. So should it he with us, resting in principle, free from the intrusion of selfish thoughts and external objects. Amidst society, he who realises the idea of the hexagram is still alone, and does not allow himself to be distracted from the con templation and following of principle. He is not a recluse, how ever, who keeps aloof from social life; but his distinction is that he maintains a supreme regard to principle, when alone, and when mingling with others. In the symbolism the author rises from one part of the body to the other. The first line at the bottom of the figure fitly suggests ‘ the toes.' The lesson is that from the first men should rest in, and be anxious to do, what is right in all their affairs. The weakness of the line and its being in an odd place give occasion for the caution, with which the paragraph concludes. Above the toes are the calves, represented by the second line, weak, but in its proper place. Above this, again, are the loins, represented by 3, strong, and in danger of being violent.

    "raw_text": "Kwei Mei indicates that (under the conditions which it denotes) action will be evil, and in no wise advantageous. conditions that may be gathered from the Text. P. Regis gives this exposition of the subject, as taken by him from the symbolism, which he ascribes to Confucius‘ Viri probi, seu republics digni, in virtutis soliditate instituendi sunt a sapiente, bonisque regulis ut altis radicibus firmandi, nec alii ad rempublicam tractandam promovendi, nisi qui paulatim per varios minoresque gradus ad magnum .hoc regimen periculo facto ascendere digni sint. 1 He then illustrates this sentiment by the words of Pliny‘ Eligetur multis experiments eruditus, et qui futura possit ex praeteritis praevidere. 1 But how does the lineal figure give the idea of a gradual advance? We shall see how it is attempted in the Great Sym bolism to get this from the component trigrams. The account theie is not satisfactory ; and still less so is what else I have been able to find on the subject, E.g,, the trigrams were originally Khwan and ZZen; but the third line of Khwan and the first of it Zen have changed places; and the trigrams now denote ‘the youngest son/ and ‘the eldest daughter.’ If all this, which is a mere farrago, were admitted, it would not help us to the idea of an advance. Again, the lines 2, 3,4, 5 are all in the places proper to them as strong or weak; we ascend by them as by regular steps to the top of the hexagram; .and this, it is said, gives the notion of the graduabteps of the advance. But neither does this carry con viction with it to the mind. We must leave the question. King f Wan, for reasons which we cannot discover, or without such reasons, determined that the hexagram Zien should denote the i gradual advance of men to positions of influence and office. The marriage of a young lady is mentioned in the Thwan as an illustration of an important event taking place with various i. The first line, undivided, shows the younger sister married off in a position ancillary to the real wife. (It suggests the idea of) a person lame on i preliminary steps, continued from its initiation to its consummation. | But all must be done in an orderly and correct manner. And so must it be with the rise of a man in the service of the state, \\ The goose from the most ancient times played an important part in the marriage ceremonies of the Chinese; and this may have suggested the use of it in the symbolism of the different lines. Its habits as a bird of passage, and flying in processional order, admirably suited the writer's purpose. In paragraph 1 it appears for the first time in the season approaching the shore. Then comes the real subject of the line; and the facts of its being weak, and without a proper correlate, agree with, if they do not suggest, what is said about him, and the caution added. The geese have advanced in line 2, and so has the officer, though he is not mentioned. The line is weak or humble, and central, and has a proper correlate in 5. Hence comes the good auspice. Line 3 is strong, and has passed the central place, to the top of the lower trigram, and has not a proper correlate in 6. Its subject is likely to be violent and at the same time unsuccessful in his movements. He is like a husband who does not care for his wife, or a wife who does not care for her child. But in the case supposed, his strength in the end would be useful. The web-footed goose is not suited for taking hold on the branches; but on flat branches it can rest. Line 4, weak, but in an even place, does not promise a good auspice for its subject; but it is the first line in the trigram of humility, and it is concluded that he will not fall into error. Line g is a strong line in the ruler’s seat; and yet it appears here as the symbol of a wife. Somehow its subject has been at variance with, and kept in disgrace by, calumniating enemies such as the plunderers of paragraph 3; but things come right in the end. The wife, childless for three years, becomes at last a mother; and there is good fortune. The subject of line 6 has reached the top of the hexagram. There is no more advance for him; and he has no conelate. But he may still do some good work for the state, and verify the auspice derived from the ornamental plumes of the geese.

    "raw_text": "F ang intimates progress and development. When a king has reached the point (which the name denotes) that the special term has a special appropriateness. The Thwan makes the hexagram give a bad auspice concerning its subject; and for this the following reasons are given:—According to Wan's symbolism of the trigrams, Tui, the lower trigram here, denotes the youngest daughter, and Zan, the upper trigram, the oldest son. And as the action of the hexagram begins with that of the lower trigram, we have in the figure two violations of propriety, First, the marriage represented is initiated by the lady and her friends, She goes to her future home instead of the bridegroom coming to fetch her. Second, the parties are unequally matched. There ought not to be such disparity of age between them. Another reason assigned for the bad auspice is that lines 2,3, 4, and 5 are all in places not suited to them, quite different from the corres ponding lines in the preceding hexagram. Is then such a marriage as the above, or marriage in general, the theme of the hexagram p I think not. The marriage comes in, as in the preceding essay, by way of illustration. With all the abuses belonging to it as an institution of his country, as will imme diately appear, the writer acknowledged it without saying a word in deprecation or correction of those abuses; but from the case he selected he wanted to set forth some principles which should obtain in the relation between a ruler and his ministers. This view is insisted on in Wan Zing’s ‘New Collection of Comments on the Yi (a.d. 1686).’ A feudal prince was said to marry nine ladies at once. The principal of them was the bride who was to be tne proper wife, and she was attended by two others, virgins from her father s harem; a cousin, and a half-sister, a daughter of her father by another mother of inferior rank. Under line 1 the younger sister THE Yf KING. there is no occasion to be anxious (through fear of a change). Let him be as die sun at noon. of the hexagram appears in the inferior position of this half-sister. But the line is strong, indicative in a female of firm virtue. The mean condition and its duties are to be deplored, and give the auspice of lameness; but notwithstanding, the secondary wife will in a measure discharge her service. There will be good fortune. Notwithstanding apparent disadvantages, an able officer may do his ruler good service. Line 2 is strong, and in the centre. The proper correlate is 5, which, however, is weak, and in the place of a strong line. With such a correlate, the able lady in 2 cannot do much in the dis charge of her proper work. But if she think only of her husband, like the widow who will die rather than marry again, such devo tion will have its effect and its reward. Though blind of one eye, she yet manages to see. And so devoted loyalty in an officer will compensate for many disadvantages, Line 3 is weak, where it should be strong; and the attribute of pleased satisfaction belonging to Tui culminates in its subject. She turns out to be of so mean a character and such a slave of passion that no one will many her. She returns and accepts the position of a concubine. Line 4 is strong, where it should be weak; but in the case of a female the indication is not bad. The subject of the line, how ever, is in 110 haste. She waits, and the good time will come. King Ti-yf has been already mentioned under the fifth line of hexagram n, and in connexion with some regulation which he made about, the marriage of daughters of the royal house. His sister here is honourably mentioned, so as to suggest that the adorning which she preferred was ‘the ornament of the hidden man of the heart, The comparison of her to ‘the moon almost full ’ I am ready to hail as an instance where the duke of Aau is for once poetical. A^angfe, however, did not see poetry, but a symbol in it, ‘The moon is not full,’ he says, ‘but only nearly full. A wife ought not to eclipse her husband I 1 However, the sister of Ti-yi gets happily married, as she deserved to do, being represented by the line in the place of honour, having its proper correlate in 2. Line 6 is weak, at the top of the hexagram, and without a proper correlate, Hence its auspice is evil. The marriage-contract is broken, according tb Affi Hsi, and does not take effect. The SECT. II.

There will be advantage in movement to give the idea that is in Lti, see Appendix II. In Appendix I there is an endeavour to explain the Thwan by means of the lines and their relation to one another. Line 1 is weak, in an odd place, and at the very bottom or commencement of the hexagram. These conditions are supposed to account for the unfavourable symbolism and auspice. Line 2 is weak, but in its proper place. That place, moreover, is the central. Hence the traveller—and he might here very well be a travelling merchant—is represented in the symbolism as provided with everything he can require; and though the auspice is not mentioned, we must understand it as being good. Line 3 is strong, and in an even place. But it occupies the topmost place in the lower trigram; and its strength may be expected to appear as violence. So it does in the symbolism, and extraordinary violence as well. It seems unreasonable to suppose, as in the conclusion, that one so described could be in any way correct. The Khang-hsi editors remark that the subjects of 2 and 3 are represented as having ‘lodging-houses,’ and not any of those of the other lines, because these are the only two lines in the places proper to them! Line 4 is strong, but in an even place. Hence its subject has not ‘ a lodging-house; ’ but has found a situation where he has shelter, though he is exposed to perils. Hence he is represented as having an axe, which may be available for defence. Still he is not at peace in his mind. The Khang-hsi editors observe well that the mention of an axe makes us think of caution as a quality desirable in a traveller. , Line 5, though weak, is in the centre of the upper tngram, which THE Y$ KING.

Then the shooting a pheasant is supposed to be suggested; an elegant bird,—by the trigram of elegance, When an officer was travelling abroad in ancient times, his gift of intro duction at any feudal court was a pheasant. The traveller here emblemed is praised by his attached friends, and exalted to a place of dignity by the ruler to whom he is acceptable, It will be seen how the idea of the fifth line being the ruler’s seat is dropt here as being alien from the idea of the hexagram, so arbitrary is the interpretation of the symbolism. Line 6 is strong, in an even place, at the extremity of Li and of the whole hexagram. Its subject will be arrogant and violent; the opposite of what a traveller should be; and the issue will be evil, The symbolism must be allowed to be extravagant. What bird ever burned its nest? And the character for ‘ox’ is strangely used for 1 ox-like docility. 5 subject). All occasion for repentance will disap pear, and all his movements will be advantageous. There may have been no (good) beginning, but there will be a (good) end. Three days before making any changes, (let him give notice of them); and three days after, (let him reconsider them). There will (thus) be good fortune. 6. The sixth line, undivided, shows the repre sentative of penetration beneath a couch, and having lost the axe with which he executed his decisions. However firm and correct he may (try to) be, there will be evil. LVII. With Sun as the fifth of the Ffi-hsi trigrams we have become familiar. It symbolises both wind and wood; and has the attributes of flexibility (nearly allied to docility) and pene tration. In this hexagram we are to think of it as representing wind with its penetrating power, finding its way into every corner and cranny. Confucius once said (Analects 12.19):—‘The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend when the wind blows upon it. 1 In accordance with this, the subject of the hexagram must be understood as the influence and orders of government designed to remedy what is wrong in the people. The ‘Daily Lecture’ says that the upper trigram denotes the orders issuing from the ruler, and the lower the obedience rendered to them by the people; but this view is hardly borne out by the Text. But how is it that the figure represents merely ‘ some little attain ment ? 1 This is generally explained by taking the first line of the trigram as indicating what the subject of it can do. But over the weak first line are two strong lines, so that its subject can accom plish but little, The Khang-hsi editors, rejecting this view, contend that, the idea of the whole figure being penetration, line 1, the symbol of weakness and what is bad, will not be able to offei much resistance to the subjects of the other lines, which will enter and dispel its influence. They illustrate this from processes of nature, education, and politics; the effect they say is described as small, because the process is not to revolutionise or renew, but only to LV III. The Tui Hexagram. Tui intimates that (under its conditions) there will be progress and attainment. (But) it will be. advantageous to be firm and correct. correct and improve. Such as it is, however, it requires the operation of the strong and virtuous, 1 the great man.’ Even all this criticism is not entirely satisfactory. Line i is weak, where it should be strong. The movements of its subject are expressive of perplexity. He wants vigour and decision. Line 2 is strong, and in the right place, and has a good auspice. Things are placed or hidden beneath a couch or bed; and the subject of the line appears as searching for them. lie calls in divi nation to assist his judgment, and exorcists to expel for him what is bad, The work is great and difficult, so that he appears almost distracted by it; but the issue is good, For this successful expla nation of the line, 1 am indebted to the Khang-hsi editors. The writer of the Text believed of course in divination and exorcism; which was his misfortune rather than his fault or folly. Line 3 is in the right place for a strong line. But its position at the top of the lower trigram is supposed to indicate the restlessness, and here the vehemence, of its subject, And 6 is no proper correlate, All Hie striving is ineffective, and there is occasion for regret, Line 4 is weak, as is its correlate in 1. But 4 is a proper place for a weak line, and it rests under the shadow of the strong and central 5. Hence the omens of evil are counteracted; and a good auspice is obtained. The game caught in hunting was divided into three portions:—the first for use in sacrifices; the second for the entertainment of visitors; and the third for the kitchen generally.

Akin to this is the significance of the hexagram Tui representing a marsh, as denoting pleasure. Although the yin lines give it its special character they owe their power and effect to the yang; so when the qualities of mildness and harmony prevail in a man, without true-heartedness and in tegrity to control and direct them, they will fail to be correct, and may degenerate into what is evil. Hence it is said that it will be advantageous to be firm and correct 1 ’ The feeling then of pleasure is the subject of this hexagram. The above quotation sufficiently explains the concluding characters of the Th wan; but where is the intimation in Tui of progress and attainments ? It is supposed to be in the one weak line surmount ing each trigram and supported by the two strong lines. Fancy sees in that mildness and benignity energised by a double portion of strength. Line i, strong in the place of strength, with no proper correlate above, is thus confined to itself. But its subject is sufficient for himself. There will be good fortune. Line 2, by the rule of place, should be weak, but it is strong, Without any proper correlate, and contiguous to the weak 3, the subject of it might be injuriously affected, and there would be cause for repentance. But the sincerity natural in his central position counteracts all this, The view of the third paragraph that appears in the translation is derived from the Khang-hsf editors.

The first line, undivided, shows its subject not the hexagram might be feared; but he discards that regard, and will do nothing to be repented of. There is a change of style in the Chinese text at this point. As Wang Shan-jze (Yuan dynasty) says‘ Here and henceforth the scattering is of what should be scattered, that what should not be scattered may be collected.’ Line 4, though weak, is in its correct place, and adjoins the strong 5, which is in the ruler’s seat. The subject of 4, therefore, will fitly represent the minister, to whom it belongs to do a great part in remedying the evil of dispersion. And this he does. He brings dissentient partizanship to an end; and not satisfied with that, he collects multitudes of those who had been divided into a great body so that they stand out conspicuous like a hill. Line 5 gives us the action of the ruler himself;—by his proclama tions, and by his benevolence. Afft Hsf and other critics enlarge on the symbolism of the perspiration, which they think much to the point. P. Regis avoids it, translating— 1 ' Ille, magnas leges dissipans, facit ut penetrent(ur ?).’ Canon McClatchie has an ingenious and original, so far as my Chinese reading goes, note upon it:— 1 ' As sweat cures fevers, so do proclamations cure rebel lions.’ Both of these translators miss the meaning of the other instance of the king’s work. . ■ < Line 6 is occupied by a strong line, which has a proper correlate in 3 ; but 3 is at the top of the trigram of peril. The subject of 6 hurries away from association with the subject of it, but does so in the spirit of the hexagram, so that there is no error or blame attaching to him. quitting the courtyard outside his door. There will be no error. 2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject not quitting the courtyard inside his gate. There will be evil. 3. The third line, divided, shows its subject with no appearance of observing the (proper) regulations, in which case we shall see him lamenting. But there will be no one to blame (but himself). 4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject quietly and naturally (attentive to all) regulations. There^ will be progress and success. 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject sweetly and acceptably enacting his regulations. There will be good fortune. The onward progress with them will afford ground for admiration. 6. The topmost line, divided, shows its subject enacting regulations severe and difficult. Even with firmness and correctness there will be evil. But though there will be cause for repentance, it will (by and by) disappear. LX. The primary application of the character Zieh was to denote the joints of the bamboo; it is used also for the joints of the human frame; and for the solar and other terms of the year. Whatever makes regular division may be denominated a Wieh; there enter into it the ideas of regulating and restraining; and the subject of this hexagram is the regulations of government enacted for the guidance and control of the people. How the constituent trigrams are supposed to suggest or indicate this meaning will be seen in Appendix II. Wu Hsi anticipates that symbolism in trying to account for the statement that the figure gives the promise of success and attain ment; hut the ground of this is generally made out by referring to the equal division of the undivided and divided lines and our having in 2 and 5, the central places, two undivided lines.

There will be advantage in cross- important point concerning ‘ regulations’ is brought out in the con clusion of the Th wan,—that they must be adapted to circumstances, and not made too strict and severe. Line 1 is strong, and in its correct place. Its subject therefore would not be wanting in power to make his way. But he is sup posed to be kept in check by the strong 2, and the correlate 4 is the first line in the trigram of peril. The course of wisdom there fore is to keep still. The character here rendered door is that belonging to the inner apartments, leading from the hall into which entrance is found by the outer gate, mentioned under line 2. The courtyard outside the door and that inside the gate is one and the same. The ‘Daily Lecture 1 says that the paragraph tells an officer not to take office rashly, but to exercise a cautious judgment in his measures. Line 2 is strong, in the wrong place; nor has it a proper correlate. Its subject keeps still, when he ought to be up and doing. There will be evil. Line 3 should be strong, but it is weak. It is neither central nor correct. It has no proper correlate, and it is the topmost line in the trigram of complacent satisfaction. Its subject will not receive the yoke of regulations; and he will find out his mistake, when it is too late. Line 4 is weak,,as it ought to be, and its subject has respect to the authority of the strong ruler in 5. Hence its good symbolism and auspice. Line 5 is strong, and in its correct place. Its subject regulates himself, having no correlate; but he is lord of the hexagram, and his influence is everywhere beneficially felt. ing the great stream. There will be advantage in being firm and correct. 1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject resting (in himself). There will be good fortune. If he sought to any other, he would not find rest 2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject (like) the crane crying out in her hidden retirement, and her young ones responding to her. (It is as if it were said), ‘ I have a cup of good spirits/ (and the response were), ‘ I will partake of it with you.’ 3. The third line, divided, shows its subject having met with his mate. Now he beats his drum, and now he leaves off. Now he weeps, and now he sings. 4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject (like) the moon nearly full, and (like) a horse (in a chariot) whose fellow disappears. There will be no error. 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject perfectly sincere, and linking (others) to him in closest union. There will be no error. 6. The topmost line, undivided, shows its subject in chanticleer (trying to) mount to heaven. Even with firm correctness there will be evil. Line 6 is weak, in its proper place. The subject of the top most line must be supposed to possess an exaggerated desire for enacting regulations. They will be too severe, and the effect will be evil. But as Confucius (Analects 3.3) says, that is not so great a fault as to be easy and remiss. It may be remedied, and cause for repentance will disappear. LXI. Afung Ffl, the name of this hexagram, may be represented in English by ‘ Inmost Sincerity.’ It denotes the highest quality of man, and gives its possessor power so that he prevails with spiritual beings, with other men, and with the lower creatures. It is the THE HSlAo KWO HEXAGRAM. 20T LX II. The HsiAo Kwo Hexagram.

There are two divided lines in the centre and two undivided below them and above them. The divided lines in the centre are held to represent the heart or mind free from all pre-occupation, without any consciousness of self; and the undivided lines, on each side of it, in the centre of the con stituent trigrams are held to denote the solidity of the virtue of one so free from selfishness. There is no unreality in it, not a single flaw. The ‘ Daily Lecture ’ at the conclusion of its paraphrase of the Thwan refers to the history of the ancient Shun, and the wonder ful achievements of his virtue. The authors give no instance of the affecting of ‘ pigs and fishes' by sincerity, and say that these names are symbolical of men, the rudest and most unsusceptible of being acted on. The Text says that the man thus gifted with sin cerity will succeed in the most difficult enterprises. Remarkable is the concluding sentence that he must be firm and correct. Here, as elsewhere throughout the Yf, there comes out the practical character which has distinguished the Chinese people and their best teaching all along the line of history. The translation of paragraph 1 is according to the view approved by the Khang-hsi editors. The ordinary view makes the other to whom the subject of line 1 looks or might look to be the subject of 4; but they contend that, excepting in the case of 3 and 6, the force of correlation should be discarded from the study of this THE YI KING, THE HSIAO KWO HEXAGRAM. ment.

Is it ever good to deviate from what is recognised as the established course of procedure ? The reply is—never in the matter of right; but in what is conventional and ceremonial—in what is non- essential—the deviation may be made, and will be productive of good. The form may be given up, but not the substance. But the thing must be done very carefully,—humbly and reverently, and in small matters. The symbolism of the bird is rather obscure. The whole of it is intended to teach humility. It is better for the bird to descend, keeping near to where it can perch and rest, than to hold on ascending into the homeless regions of the air. Line i is weak, in an odd place, and possessed by the ‘ idea of exceeding,' which belongs to the hexagram. Its correlate is the strong 4, belonging to the trigram ifan, the attribute of which is movement. There is nothing to repress the tendency of i; rather it is stimulated; and hence the symbolism. Line 2 is weak, but in its proper place, and in the centre. Its correlate is 5, which is also a weak line. The lines 3 and 4 between them are both strong; and are supposed to represent the father and grandfather of the subject of 2; but he or she goes past them, and meets with the grandmother in g. Again, 5 is the ruler’s seat. The subject of 2 moves on to him, but not as an enemy; but humbly and loyally, as his minister according to the attributes of a weak line in the central place. It must be allowed that this view of the symbolism and its interpretation is obscure and strained. The subject of line 3 is too confident in his own strength, and too defiant of the weak and small enemies that seek his hurt. SECT. ir. THE id fit HEXAGRAM. and correct.

There will be no advantage in any way. further so soon after success has been achieved; but keep herself hidden and retired. Let her not try to find the screen. When it is said that she will find this ‘ after seven days,’ the meaning seems to be simply this, that the period of K\\ will then, have been exhausted, the six lines having been gone through, and a new period, when action will be proper, shall have commenced. The strong line 3, at the top of the lower trigram, suggests for its subject one undertaking a vigorous enterprise. The writer thinks of Kao bung, the sacrificial title of Wu Ting, one of the ablest sovereigns of the Shang dynasty (b.c. 1364-1324), who undertook an expedition against the barbarous hordes of the cold and bleak regions north of the Middle States. He is mentioned again under the next hexagram. He appears also in the Shfi, IV, ix, and in the Shih, IV, iii, ode 5. His enterprise may have been good, and successful, but it was tedious, and the paragraph con cludes with a caution. Line 4 is weak, and has advanced into the trigram for water. Its subject will be cautious, and prepare for evil, as in the sym bolism, suggested probably by the nature of the trigram. ‘The neighbour in the East’ is the subject of line 5, and ‘the neighbour in the West ’ is the subject of the correlate 2, the former quarter being yang and the latter yin. Line 5 is strong, and 2 is weak; but weakness is more likely to be patient and cautious than strength. They are compared to two men sacrificing. The one presents valuable offerings; the other very poor ones. But the 1. The first line, divided, shows its subject (like a fox) whose tail gets immersed. There will be occasion for regret. 2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject dragging back his (carriage-)wheel. With firmness and correctness there will be good fortune. 3. The third line, divided, shows its subject, with (the state of things) not yet remedied, advancing on; which will lead to evil. But there will be advantage in (trying to) cross the great stream. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject by firm correctness obtaining good fortune, so that all occasion for repentance disappears. Let him stir himself up, as if he were invading the Demon region, where for three years rewards will come to him (and his troops) from the great kingdom. 5- The fifth line, divided, shows its subject by firm correctness obtaining good fortune, and having no occasion for repentance. (We see in him) the brightness of a superior man, and the possession of sincerity. There will be good fortune, 6. The topmost line, undivided, shows its subject second excels in sincerity, and his small offering is the more acceptable. The topmost line is weak, and on the outmost edge of Khan, the trigram of peril. His action is violent and perilous, like that one attempting to cross a ford, and being plunged overhead into the water. LXIV. Wei 31 is the reverse of K\\ 3 t The name tells us that the successful accomplishment of whatever the writer had in his mind had not yet been realised. The vessel of the state has not been brought across the great and dangerous stream. Some have wished that the Yi might have concluded with K\\ 3 i, and the last hexagram have left us with the picture of human affairs all brought to good order. But this would not have been in harmony with the SECT. 11. THE WEI sf HEXAGRAM. full of confidence and therefore feasting (quietly). There will be no error. (If he) cherish this con- idea of the Yf, as the book of change. Again and again it has been pointed out that we find in it no idea of a perfect and abiding state. Just as the seasons of the year change and pursue an ever- recurring round, so is it with the phases of society, The reign of order has been, and has terminated; and this hexagram calls us to see the struggle for its realisation recommenced. It treats of how those engaged in that struggle should conduct themselves with a view to secure the happy consummation. How the figure sets forth the state of things by its constituent trigrams will appear in Appendix II. A similar indication is supposed to be given by the lines, not one of which is in the cor rect place; the strong lines being all in even places, and the weak lines in odd. At the same time each of them has a proper corre late; and so the figure gives an intimation of some successful progress. See also Appendix I. The symbolism of the young fox suggests a want of caution on the part of those, in the time and condition denoted by the hexa gram, who try to remedy prevailing disorders. Their attempt is not successful, and they get themselves into trouble and danger. Whatever can be done must be undertaken in another way. I suppose a fox to be intended by the symbolism of line 1, bringing that animal on from the Thwan. Some of the com mentators understand it of any animal. The line is weak, at the bottom of the trigram of peril, and responds to the strong 4, which is not in its correct place. Its subject attempts to be doing, but finds cause to regret his course. The subject of line 2, strong, and in the centre, is able to repress himself, and keep back his carriage from advancing; and there is good fortune. The Khang-hst editors say that it is very difficult to understand what is said under line 3; and many critics suppose that a negative has dropt out, and that we should really read that ‘it will not be advantageous to try and cross the great stream.’ Line 4, though strong, is in an even place; and this might vitiate the endeavours of its subject to bring about a better state of things. But he is firm and correct. He is in the fourth place more over, and immediately above there is his ruler, represented by a weak line, humble therefore, and prepared to welcome his endeavours. Let him exert himself vigorously and long, as Kao $ung did in his THE \\1 KING. fidence, till he (is like the fox who) gets his head immersed, it will fail of what is right. famous expedition (see last hexagram, line 3), and he will make progress and have success. Expeditions beyond the frontiers in those days were not very remote. Intercourse was kept up between the army and the court. Rewards, distinctions, and whatever was necessary to encourage the army, were often sent to it. Line 5 is weak, in an odd place. But its subject is the ruler, humble and supported by the subject of the strong 2; and hence the auspice is very good. The subject of line 6, when the work of the hexagram has been done, appears disposed to remain quiet in the confidence of his own power, but enjoying himself; and thereby he will do right. If, on the contrary, he will go on to exert his powers, and play with the peril of the situation, the issue will be bad. THE APPENDIXES THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I.

I. The hexagram JT/uen is made up of six undivided lines, or of the trigram if/hen, Ffi-hsfs symbol for heaven, repeated. The Thwan does not dwell upon this, but starts, in its exposition, from the word ‘ heaven,’ supposing that the hexagram represented all the meaning which had ever been intended by that term, In para graphs 1,2,4 the four attributes in Wtin’s Text (2 being occupied vith the second, though it is not expressly named) are illustrated by the phenomena taking place in the physical world. In paragraphs 3 and 5, the subject is the sage. He is not named indeed; and Khung Ying-ti (a.d. 574-648) does not introduce him till paragraph 5, when the meaning necessitates the presence of a human agent, who rules in the world of men as eaven does.in that of nature. The ‘ connexion between the end and the beginning,’ which he sees, is that of cause and effect in the operations of nature and the course of human affairs. The various steps in t. at course are symbolised by the lines of the hexagram; ant t e real sage, conducting his ideal government, taking his measures accordingly, is represented as driving through the sky in a carnage drawn by six dragons. M Hsi extravagantly says that ie sage is Heaven, and Heaven is the sage; ’ but there is nothing like this in the text. HEX. 3. 4, ‘ If he take the initiative, he goes astray ; ’—he misses, that is, his proper course. 1 If he follow,’ he is docile, and gets into his regular (course). 1 In the south-west he will get friends: ’—he will be walking with those of his own class. ‘ In the north-east he will lose friends:’—but in the end there will be ground for congratulation. 5. ‘ The good fortune arising from resting in firm ness ’ corresponds to the unlimited capacity of the earth. III. 1. In /Tun we have the strong (Kklen) and the weak (Khwan) commencing their intercourse, and difficulties arising. 2.

As the writer in expounding the Thwan of hexagram 1 starts from the word ‘heaven,’ so here he does so from the symbolic mean ing attached to ‘earth,’ What I have said on the Text about the difference with which the same attributes are ascribed to Alien and K h wan, appears clearly in paragraph 1. It is the diffeience ex pressed by the words that I have supplied, ‘power and ‘capacity. Alien originates; Khwan produces, or gives birth to what has been originated. The ‘ penetrating,' or developing ability of Khwan, as displayed in the processes of growth, is the subject of paragraph 2. ‘ I he brightness’ refers to ihe beauty that shines forth in the vegetable and animal worlds. Paragraph 3 treats of the symbol of the ‘ mare,’ to lead the mind to the course of ‘ the superior man,' the good and faithful minister and servant. See the note, corresponding to paragraph 4, on the Text. Nest ing in firmness' is the normal course of Khwan. Where it is pursued, the good effect will be great, great as the unlimited capacity of the earth. THE APPENDIXES.

Feudal princes should be established, but the feeling that rest and peace have been secured should not be indulged (even then). IV. 1. In Mang we have (the trigram for) a mountain, and below it that of a rugged defile with a stream in it. The conditions of peril and arrest III. Jun is made up of the trigrams Jin and Khan; but according to the views on king Wan’s arrangement of the trigrams, as set forth especially in Appendix V, chap. 14, the six others come from JMen and Khwan, and are said to be their children. On the first application of Khwan to JJen, there results Jan, the first line of J/rien taking the place of the last of Khwan; and on the second application, there results Khan, the middle line of JAien taking the place of that of Khwln. McClatchie renders here:—‘The Thun (Jun) diagram represents the hard and the soft (air) beginning to have sexual intercourse, and bringing forth with suffering! ’ But there is nothing in the Yf, from the beginning to the end, to justify such an interpretation, Nor do I see how, from any account of the genesis by the component trigrams, the idea of the result as signifying a state of difficulty and distress can be readily made out. In paragraph 2 there is an attempt from the virtues or attributes assigned to the trigrams to make out the result indicated in the Thwan, To move and excite is the quality of Jln; perilous ness is the quality of Khan. The power to move is likely to produce great effects; to do this in perilous and difficult circum stances requires firmness and correctness. But neither is this explanation very satisfactory. , The part of paragraph 3 depicts a condition of trouble and disorder in the natural world occasioned by the phenomena that are symbols of the significance of Jan and Khan; but this is symbolical again of the disorder and distress, political and social, characteristic of the time. Good princes throughout the nation would help to remedy that; but the supreme authority should not resign itself to indifference, trusting to them. HEX, 4. of progress (suggested by these) give (the idea in) Mang. 2. 1 Mang indicates that there will be progress and success: ’—for there is development at work in it, and its time of action is exactly what is right. ‘ I do not seek the youthful and inexperienced; he seeks me: '—so does will respond to will. 1 When he shows (the sincerity that marks) the first recourse to divination, I instruct him: ’—for possessing the qualities of the undivided line and being in the central place, (the subject of the second line thus speaks). ‘ A second and third application create annoyance, and I do not instruct so as to create annoyance:’—annoyance (he means) to the ignorant. (The method of dealing with) the young and igno rant is to nourish the correct (nature belonging to them);—this accomplishes the service of the sage. IV. The trigram Kan has for its symbol in the natural world a mountain, which stands up frowningly, and stops or arrests the progress of the traveller. Stoppage, understood sometimes actively, and sometimes passively, is called the virtue or attribute indicated j. by it. Khan, as I said on p. 32, has water for its symbol, and especially in the form of rain. Here, however, the water appears as a stream in a difficult defile, such as ordinarily appears on an approach to a mountain, and suggesting perilousness as the attri bute of such a position. From the combination of these symbols and their attributes the writer thinks that he gets the idea of the character (not the entire hexagram) Ming, as symbolical of igno rance and inexperience. See on ‘ the Great Symbolism below. Down to the last sentence of paragraph 2, all that is said is intended to show how it is that the figure indicates progress and success. The whole representation is grounded on the undivided line’s being in the central place. It is the symbol of active effort ! for the teaching of the ignorant in the proper place and time; this being responded to by the divided fifth line, representing the ignorance to be taught as docile, 1 will responds to will. But the 2l8 the appendixes. appendix I. V. i. Hsti denotes waiting. (The figure) shows peril in front; but notwithstanding the firmness and strength (indicated by the inner trigram), its subject does not allow himself to be involved (in the danger ous defile)it is right he should not be straitened or reduced to extremity. 2. When it is said that, ‘with the sincerity de clared in Hsti, there will be brilliant success, and with firmness there will be good fortune,’ this is shown by the position (of the fifth line) in the place assigned by Heaven, and its being the correct posi tion for it, and in the centre. 4 It will be advan tageous to go through the great stream;’— that is, going forward will be followed by meritorious achievement. subject of line 2 requires sincerity in the applicant for instruction, and feels that he must make his own teaching acceptable and agreeable, All this serves to bring out the idea of progress and success. 1 hen finally in the young and ignorant there is ‘a correct nature,’ a^moral state made for goodness. The efficient teacher directing his efforts to bring out and nourish that, the progress and success will be ‘great;' the service done will be worihy of ‘a sage,' V. Hsti is composed of ZAien, having the quality of strength, and of Iihan, having the quality of perilousness.

(The coming together of) strength and peril gives (the idea in) Sung. 2. ‘Sung intimates how, though there is sin cerity in one’s contention, he will yet meet with opposition and obstruction; but if he cherish an apprehensive caution, there will be good fortune:’— a strong (line) has come and got the central place (in the lower trigram). ‘ If he must prosecute the contention to the (bitter) end, there will be evil ’.’—contention is not a thing to be carried on to extremity. ‘ It will be advantageous to meet with the great man: '—what he sets a value on is the due mean, and the correct place. * It will not be advantageous to cross the great stream: ’—one (attempting to do so) would find himself in an abyss. VI, Paragraph I here is much to the same effect as the first sentence in the notes on the Thwan of the Text. It is said, 1 Strength without peril would not produce contention; peril with out strength would not be able to contend.’ 2. ‘A strong line has come and got the central place:’—this sentence has given rise to a doctrine about the changes of trigrams and hexagrams, which has obscured more than anything else the interpretation of the Yt. Where has the strong second line come from ? From a hundred critics we receive the answer,— 1 From Tun (EE-EE).’ The reader will see that if the second and third lines of the lower trigram there be made to change places, theie results ==r, or Sung, The doctrine of changing the figures by the manipulation of the stalks did spring up between the time of Wan and his son and that of the composition of the Appendixes; but there is no trace of it in the real Text of the Yi; and it renders any scheme for the interpretation of the figures impossible. The THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I. SECT. i, HEX. 6. VII. i. (The name) Sze describes the multitude (of the host).

When (the mover) is able to use the multitude with such correctness, he may attain to the royal sway, 2. There is (the symbol of) strength in the centre (of the trigram below), and it is responded to (by its proper correlate above). The action gives rise to perils, but is in accordance (with the best sentiments of men). (Its mover) may by such action distress all the country, but the people will follow him there will be good fortune, and what error should there be ? VIII. i. ‘Pi indicates that there is good for tune : ’—(the name) Pi denotes help; (and we see in the figure) inferiors docilely following (their superior). editors of the imperial Yf allow this, and on the present passage dis card the doctrine entirely, referring to the language of the T h wan on hexagrams n and 12 as fatal to it. See the notes there, and the Introduction, pp. ix-16. 'Astrong line has come' is to be taken as equivalent simply to ‘a strong line is there.’ Vhat ‘the great man sets a value on being the due mean and the correct place, his decision in any matter of contention is sure to be right. \"VII. That 1 multitude is given here as if it were^he meaning of the name Sze arose, probably, from there being but one undivided line in the figure. That is the symbol of the general, all the other lines, divided, suggest the idea of a multitude obedient to his orders. e general s place in the centre of the lower trigram, with the proper correlate in line 5, suggests the idea of firmness and cor rectness that dominates in the hexagram. But in the last sentence it is the ruler, and not the general of the host, who is the subject. Compare what is said of him with Mencius, I, i, chap. 3 *. ii, chap. 5 , &c. 2. ‘ Let (the principal party intended in it) re examine himself, (as if) by divination, whether his virtue be great, unintermitting, and firmif it be so, there will be no error:—all this follows from the position of the strong line in the centre (of the upper trigram). ‘ Those who have not rest will come to him: ’—high and low will respond to its subject. ‘With those who are (too) late in coming it will be ill: ’—(for them) the way (of good fortune here indi cated) has been exhausted. IX. 1. In Hsiao Khn the weak line occupies its (proper) position, and (the lines) above and below respond to it. Hence comes the name of Hsiao /VM (Small Restraint). 2. (It presents the symbols of) strength and flexibility. Strong lines are in the central places, and the will (of their subjects) will have free course. Thus it indicates that there will be progress and success. 3, ‘ Dense clouds but no rain’ indicate the move ment (of the strong lines) still going forward. The ‘Perilousness’ is the attribute of Khan, the lower trigram, and ‘ docility,’ or ‘accordance with others,' that of Khwan, the upper. War is like ‘ poison ’ to a country, injurious, and threatening ruin to it, and yet the people will endure and encounter it in behalf of the sovereign whom they esteem and love. VIII. There is some error in the text here,—as all the critics acknowledge. I have adopted the decision of Wfi Hsi, which by a very small change makes the whole read consistently, and in harmony with other explanations of the Thwan. ‘ The inferiors are the subjects of all the other lines gathering round their supe rior, represented in the fifth line. < The W ay has been exhausted: ’—they do not seek to promote and enjoy union till it is too late. The sentiment is the same as that in the lines of Shakespeare about the tide in the affairs of men. THE APPENDIXES.

In Li we have (the symbol of) weakness treading on (that of) strength, 2, (The lower trigram) indicates pleasure and satisfaction, and responds to (the upper) indicating strength, Hence (it is said), ‘ He treads on the tail of a tiger, which does not bite him; there will be progress and success.’ 3, (The fifth line is) strong, in the centre, and in IX. 'The weak line’ is said to occupy ‘its proper position,’ because it is in the fourth,—an even place. The ‘ responding ’ on the part of all the other lines above and below is their submitting to be restrained by it; and this arises simply from the meaning which king Wan chose to attach to the hexagram, But the restraint can only be small. The attributes of the two parts of the figure do not indicate anything else. The undivided line represents vigour and activity, and such a line is in the middle of each trigram. There cannot but be progress and success. It is not easy to explain the symbolism of the last paragraph in harmony with the appended explanations. What Khl ng-jfze, Wang Fang, and other scholars say is to this effect :-Dense clouds ought to give rain, That they exist without doing so, shows the restraining influence of the hexagram to be still at work. But the other and active influence is, according to the general idea of the figure, continuing in operationthere will be rain ere long. And this was taking place in the western regions subject to the House of Z&u, which still was only a fief of Shang, It was not for the inferior House to rule the superior. Zau was for a time restrained by Shang. Let their positions be reversed by Zau superseding ang, and the rain of beneficent government would descend on all the kingdom. This seems to be the meaning of the paragraph. This .s the answer to the riddle of it. Confucius, in his treatise on the Thwan, hints at it, but no Chinese critic has the boldness to declare it fully. HEX. II. appendix I. its correct place. (Its subject) occupies the God- (given) position, and falls into no distress or failure;—• (his) action will be brilliant. XI. ‘The little come and the great gone in Thai, and its indication that there will be good fortune with progress and success’ show to us heaven and earth in communication with each other, and all things in consequence having free course, and (also) the high and the low, (superiors and inferiors), in communication with one another, and possessed by the same aim. The inner (tri- gram) is made up of the strong and undivided lines, and the outer of the weak and divided; the inner is (the symbol of) strength, and the outer of docility; the inner (represents) the superior man, and the outer the small man. (Thus) the way of X. ‘(The symbol of) weakness’ in paragraph x, according to Wang Shan-jze (Yuan dynasty), is line 3, urged by the two strong lines below, and having to encounter the three strong lines above. Hft Ping-wan (also of the Yiian dynasty) says that the whole of the lower trigram, Tui, partaking of the yin nature, is the symbol of weakness, and the whole of Z/iien that of strength, The Aeh- /sfung editors say that, to get the full meaning, we must hold both views. , . .. Paragraph 2 has been sufficiently explained on the Thwan itself. Paragraph 3 has also been explained ; but there remains some thing to be said on the Chinese text for 'occupies^ the God- given position,’ or, literally, ‘ treads on the seat of Tn Canon McClatchie has— 1 The imperial throne is now occupied. I think that ‘the seat of Tt’ is synonymous with ‘the seat of Heaven, m paragraph 2 of this treatise on hexagram 5 * If Confucius, or who ever was the writer, had before him the phrase as it occurs m the Shft, 1 ,12, the force of Tt will depend on the meaning assigned to it in that part of the Shi That the fifth line occupies the place of authority is here the only important point. THE APPENDIXES. SECT. I, the superior man appears increasing, and that of the small man decreasing. XII. ‘The want of good understanding between the (different classes of) men in Phi, and its indica tion as unfavourable to the firm and correct course of the superior man; with the intimation that the great are gone and the little come:’—all this springs from the fact that in it heaven and earth are not in communication with each other, and all things in consequence do not have free course; and that the high and the low (superiors and inferiors) are not in communication with one another, and there are no (well-regulated) states under the sky, The inner (trigram) is made up of the weak and divided lines, and the outer of the strong and undivided; the inner is (the symbol of) weakness, and the outer of strength; the inner (represents) the small man, and the outer the superior man. Thus the way of the small man appears increasing, and that of the superior man decreasing. XI. There is nothing to be said on the explanation of the Tlnvan here beyond what has been noticed on the different para graphs of the Text. Canon McClatchie translatesThe Th wan means that Heaven and Earth have now conjugal intercourse with each other... . and the upper and lower (classes) unite together.’ But in both clauses the Chinese characters are the same. Why did he not go on to say—‘the upper and lower classes have conjugal intercourse together;’ or rather, why did he not dismiss the idea of such intercourse from his mind altogether? Why make the Yt appear to be gross, when there is not the shadow of grossness in it? The paragraph here well illustrates how the ruling idea in all the antinomies of the Yi is that of authority : and strength on the one side, and of inferiority and weakness on the other, XII. All the symbolism here springs from the trigram Khwan HEX. 14. APPENDIX I. XIII. 1. In Thung Zan the weak (line) has the place (of influence), the central place, and responds to (the corresponding line in) Kh ien (above); hence comes its name of Thung Zan (or ' Union of men’). 2. Thung Zan says:— 3. The language, ‘ Thung Zan appears here (as we find it) in (the remote districts of) the country, indicating progress and success, and that it will be advantageous to cross the great stream,’ is moulded by its containing the strength (symbolled) in Kh ien. (Then) we have (the trigram indicating) elegance and intelligence, supported by (that indicating) strength; with the line in the central, and its correct, position, and responding (to the corres ponding line above)(all representing) the correct course of the superior man. It is only the superior man who can comprehend and affect the minds of all under the sky. XIV. 1. In Tff Yft the weak (line) has the place of honour, is grandly central, and (the strong lines) above and below respond to it. Hence comes its name of Tff Yft (Having what is Great). but how can earth (symbolised by Khwan) take the place of heaven (symbolised by W/nen) ? As in nature it is heaven that originates and not earth, so in a state the upper classes must take the initiative, and not the lower. XIII. To understand the various points in this commentary, it is only necessary to refer to the Text of the hexagram. The proper correlate of line 2 is line 5, and I have said therefore that it' re sponds to (the corresponding line in) Z/Hen.’ The editors of the Khang-hsi edition, however, would make the correlate to it all the lines of jSTAien, as being more agreeable to the idea of union. I do not think that a second paragraph has been lost. The THE APPENDIXES. SECT. r. 2. The attributes (of its component trigrams) are strength and vigour with elegance and brightness. (The ruling line in it) responds to (the ruling line in the symbol of) heaven, and (consequently) its action is (all) at the proper times. In this way (it is said to) indicate great progress and success. XV. i. Kh ien indicates progress and success. It is the way of heaven to send down its bene ficial influences below, where they are brilliantly displayed. It is the way of earth, lying low, to send its influences upwards and (there) to act. 2. It is the way of heaven to diminish the full and augment the humble. It is the way of earth to overthrow the full and replenish the humble. Spiritual Beings inflict calamity on the full and bless the humble. It is the way of men to hate the full and love the humble. Humility in a posi tion of honour makes that still more brilliant; and in a low position men will not (seek to) pass beyond it. Thus it is that ‘ the superior man will have a (good) issue (to his undertakings).’ ‘Thung Zm says' is merely a careless repetition of the three concluding characters of paragraph i. XIV. The position in the fifth place indicates the dignity, and its being central, in the centre of the upper trigram, indicates the virtue, of the lord of the figure. lhe strength of the lord, moreover, is directed by intelligence; and his actions are always at the proper time, like the seasons of heaven. XV. The Thwan on this hexagram was so brief, that the writer here deals generally with the subject of humility, showing how it is valued by heaven and earth, by spirits and by men. The descent of the heavenly influences, and the low position of the earth in paragiaph i, ate both emblematic of humility. The heavenly influ ences have their 1 display’ in the beauty and fertility of the earth. hex. 16. APPENDIX I. XVI. I. In Yu we see the strong (line) re sponded to by all the others, and the will (of him whom it represents) being carried out; and (also) docile obedience employing movement (for its pur poses). (From these things comes) Yil (the Condi tion of harmony and satisfaction). 2. In this condition we have docile obedience employing movement (for its purposes), and there fore it is so as between heaven and earth;—how much more will it be so (among men) in ‘the setting up of feudal princes and putting the hosts in motion!’ 3, Heaven and earth show that docile obedience in connexion with movement, and hence the sun and moon make no error (in time), and the four seasons do not deviate (from their order). The sages show such docile obedience in connexion with their move ments, and hence their punishments and penalties are entirely just, and the people acknowledge it by their submission. Great indeed are the time and significance indicated in Yil! The way of heaven is seen, e.g. in the daily declining of the sun, and the waning of the moon after it is full; the way of earth in the fall of the year. On the meaning of ‘Spiritual Beings (Kwei Shan),’ see the Introduction, pp. 34,35.. It is difficult to say what idea the writer attached to the name. What he says of mans appreciation of humility is striking, and, 1 believe, correct. XVI. What is said in paragraph 1 about the lines has been pointed out in the notes on the Text. ‘ Obedience is the attribute of IChwan, the lower trigram, which takes the initiative in the action of the figure; and here makes use of the movement, which is the attribute of .Wan, the upper trigram. I can hardly trace the connexion between the different parts of paragraph 2. Does it not proceed on the harmony produced by the thunderous explosion between heaven and earth, as declared THE APPENDIXES. XVII. i. In Sui we see the strong (trigram) come and place itself under the weak; we see (in the two) the attributes of movement and pleasure :— this gives (the idea of) Sui. 2. * There will be great progress and success; and through firm correctness no error:’—all under heaven will be found following at such a time. 3. Great indeed are the time and significance indicated in Sui. XVIII. 1. In Ku we have the strong (trigram) above, and the weak one below; we have (below) pliancy, and (above) stopping: — these give the idea of Ku (a Troublous Condition of affairs verg ing to ruin). 2. ‘Ku indicates great progress and success:’— (through the course shown in it), all under heaven, there will be good order. * There will be advantage in crossing the great stream: ’—he who advances will encounter the business to be done. ‘(He should in Appendix II ? Then the analogy between natural phenomena and human and social experiences comes into play. Paragraph 3 is also tantalising. Why does the writer introduce the subject of punishments and penalties ? Are they a consequence of putting the hosts in motion ? XVII. The trigrams Wan and Tui are distinguished as strong and weak, Wan representing, on king Wan's scheme, ‘the eldest son,’ and Tui, ‘ the youngest daughter.’ But. ‘the strong’ here may mean the strong line, the lowest in the hexagram. As Wang 3 img-ten (Sung dynasty) says:- 1 The yang and strong line should not be below a yin and weak line, as we find it here. That is, in Sui the high places himself below the low, and the noble below; the mean:'-esteeming others higher than himself, and giving the idea of following. Then Warn denotes the production or excitement of motion, and Tui denotes pleasure; and the union of these things suggests the same idea. HEX. 20.

XX. 1. The great Manifester occupies an upper place (in the figure), which consists of (the trigrams XVIII. The symbolism here is the opposite of that in Sui. The upper trigram Wan is strong, denoting, according to king W&n, * the youngest son; ’ and the lower, Sun, is weak, denoting ‘the eldest daughter.’ For the eldest daughter to be below the youngest son is eminently correct, and helps to indicate the auspice of great success. The attribute of Sun is pliancy, and that of Wan stoppage or arrest. The feeble pliancy confronted by the arresting moun tain gives an idea of the evil state implied in Kfl. ‘Three days before and after the turning-point’ is, literally, ‘ three days before and after M,’ M being the name of the first of the ‘earthly stems’ among the cyclical characters. Hence it has the meaning of ‘ beginning,’ and here denotes the turning-point, at which disorder gives place to order. According to ‘ the procedure of Heaven,’ history is a narrative of change, one condition of affairs constantly giving place to another and opposite. ‘ A kingdom that cannot be moved 1 does not enter into the circle of Chinese ideas.

He is in the central position and his correct place, and thus exhibits (his lessons) to all under heaven. 2. ‘Kwan shows its subject like a worshipper who has washed his hands, but not (yet) presented his offerings;—with sincerity and an appearance of dignity (commanding reverent regard): ’—(all) beneath look to him and are transformed. 3. When we contemplate the spirit-like way of Heaven, we see how the four seasons proceed with out error. The sages, in accordance with (this) spirit-like way, laid down their instructions, and all under heaven yield submission to them. XXI. 1. The existence of something between the jaws gives rise to the name Shih Ho (Union by means of biting through the intervening article). 2. The Union by means of biting through the intervening article indicates * the successful progress (denoted by the hexagram).’ The strong and weak (lines) are equally divided (in the figure). Movement is denoted (by the lower trigram), and bright intelligence (by the upper); thunder and lightning uniting in them, and having brilliant manifestation. The weak (fifth) line is in XX, ‘The great Manifester ’ is the ruler, the principal subject of the hexagram, and represented by line 5, near the top of the figure. In that figure the lower trigram is Khwan, representing the earth, with the attribute of docility, and the upper is Sun, representing wind, with the attributes of flexibility and penetration. As is the place of line 5, so are the virtues of the ruler. The spirit-like way of Heaven' is the invisible and unfathomable agency ever operating by general laws, and with invariable regu larity, in what we call nature. Compare with this paragraph, the definition of Shan or Spirit in Appendix III, i, 32; and the doctrine of the agency of God, taught in Appendix VI,’ 8, 9. HEX. 22. APPENDIX T. the centre, and acts in its high position. Although it is noc in its proper position, this is advantageous for the use of legal constraints. XXII. 1. (When it is said that) Pi indicates that there should be free course (in what it denotes) 2. (We see) the weak line coming and ornament ing the strong lines (of the lower trigram), and hence (it is said that ornament) * should have free course.’ On the other hand, the strong line above ornaments the weak ones (of the upper trigram), and hence (it is said) that ‘ there will be little advan tage, if (ornament) be allowed to advance (and take the lead).’ (This is illustrated in the) appearances that ornament the sky. 3. Elegance and intelligence (denoted by the lower trigram) regulated by the arrest (denoted by the upper) suggest the observances that adorn human (society). 4. We look at the ornamental figures of the sky, and thereby ascertain the changes of the seasons. We look at the ornamental observances of society, and understand how the processes of transformation are accomplished all under heaven. XXI. The ‘ equal division of the strong and weak lines' is seen by taking them in pairs, though the order in the first pair is different from that in the two others. This is supposed to indicate the in telligence of the judgments in the action of the hexagram. Aan, the lower trigram, symbolises movement; Li, the upper, intelli gence. The fifth line's acting in its high position does not intimate the formation of the figure from Yf, the 42nd hexagram, but calls attention to the fact that a weak line is here ‘ lord of judgment.’ This does not seem natural, but the effect is good/-judgment is tempered by leniency. XXII. The first paragraph is either superfluous or incomplete. The language of paragraph 2 has naturally been pressed into the THE APPENDIXES. 2 3 2 XXIII. i, Po denotes overthrowing or being overthrown. We see (in the figure) the weak lines (threatening to) change the (last) strong line (into one of themselves). 2. That ‘it will not be advantageous to make a movement in any direction whatever’ appears from the fact that the small men are (now) growing and increasing. The superior man acts according to (the exigency of the time), and stops all forward movement, looking at the (significance of the) symbolic figures (in the hexagram). He values the processes of decrease and increase, of fulness and decadence, (as seen) in the movements of the heavenly bodies, service of the doctrine of changing the figures by divining manipu lation; see p. 219, on paragraph 2 of the Thwan of hexagram 6. But as the Khang-hsi editors point out, ‘ the weak line coming and ornamenting the two strong lines' simply indicates how substan tiality should have the help of ornament, and ‘the strong line above (or ascending) and ornamenting the two weak lines ’ indicates that ornament should be restrained by substantiality. Ornament has its use, but it must be kept in check.—The closing sentence has no connexion with what precedes. Some characters are wanting, to show how the writer passes on to speak of ‘ the orna mental figures of the sky.’ The whole should then be joined on to paragraph 3, The ‘figures of the sky' are all the heavenly bodies In their relative positions and various movements, producing day and night, heat and cold, &c. The observances of society are the ceremonies and performances which regulate and beautify the intercourse of men, and constitute the transforming lessons of sagely wisdom. XXIII. ‘The symbolic figures in the hexagram’ are K Invan, below, the representative of docility, acting as circumstances require; and Kan, the representative of a mountain, which arrests the progress of the traveller. The superior man of the topmost line thus interprets them, and acts accordingly. Yet he is not left without hope. Winter is followed by spring; night is hex. 23. APPENDIX 1. XXIV. i. 1 Ffi indicates the free course and pro gress (of what it denotes): ’—it is the coming back of what is intended by the undivided line. 2. (Its subject’s) actions show movement directed by accordance with natural order. Hence ‘he finds no one to distress him in his exits and entrances,’ and ‘ friends come to him, and no error is committed.’ 3. ‘ He will return and repeat his proper course; in seven days comes his return;’—such is the move ment of the heavenly (revolution). 4. ‘ There will be advantage in whatever direction movement is made : ’—the strong lines are growing and increasing. 5. Do we not see in Ffi the mind of heaven and earth ? XXV. In Wu Wang we have the strong (first) line come from the outer (trigram), and become in the inner trigram lord (of the whole figure); we have (the attributes of) motive power and strength; we have the strong line (of the fifth place) in the succeeded by day; the moon wanes, and then begins to wax again. So will it be in political life. As we read in the Hebrew prophet Isaiah, ‘In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.’ XXIY, ‘ The movement of the heavenly revolution ’ in paragraph 3 has reference to the regular alternations of darkness and light, and of cold and heat, as seen in the different months of the year, Hau Hsing-kwo (of the Thang dynasty) refers to the expressions in the Shih, I, xv, ode 1, ‘ the days of (our) first (month), second (month),’ &c., as illustrating the use of day for month, as we have it here; but that is to explain what is obscure by what is more so; though I believe, as stated on the Text, that * seven days ’ is here equivalent to ‘ seven months.' ‘The mind of heaven and earth’ is the love of life and of all goodness that rules in the course of nature and providence. THE APPENDIXES. central position, and responded to (by the weak second):—there will be ‘ great progress proceeding from correctness; such is the appointment of Heaven. 1 If (its-subject and his action) be not correct, he will fall into errors, and it will not be advantageous for him to move in any direction:’—whither can he (who thinks he is) free from all insincerity, (and ; yet is as here described) proceed ? Can anything be done (advantageously) by him whom the (will and) appointment of Heaven do not help ? XXVI. i. In (the trigrams composing) Ta Kkt we have (the attributes) of the greatest strength and of substantial solidity, which emit a brilliant light; and indicate a daily renewal of his virtue (by the subject of it). 2. The strong line is in the highest place, and suggests the value set on talents and virtue; there is power (in the upper trigram) to keep the strongest in restraint:—all this shows ‘the great correctness’ (required in the hexagram). 3. ‘The good fortune attached to the subject’s not seeking to enjoy his revenues in his own family’ shows how talents and virtue are nourished. j XXV. The advocates of one trigram’s changing into another, which ought not to be admitted, we have seen, into the interpretation | of the Yi, make Wh Wang to be derived from Sung (No. 6 ), the j second line there being manipulated into the first of this; but this representation is contrary to the words of the text, which make the | strong first line come from the outer trigram, i.e. from X&ien. And so it does, as related, not very intelligibly, in Appendix V, 10, | A'an, the lower trigram here, being 1 the eldest son,’ resulting from jgg _ the first application of Khwan to jOien. The.three peculiarities in the structure of the figure afford the auspice of progress and |||ggg| success ; and very striking is the brief and emphatic declaration, ■\" kfJUj\"-' that such progress is ‘ the appointment of Heaven.’ HEX, 27. APPENDIX I. 4. ‘It will be advantageous to cross the great stream:’—(the fifth line, representing the ruler,) is responded to by (the second, the central line of A 7 nen, representing) Heaven. XXVII. 1. ‘ 1 indicates that with firm correctness there will be good fortune: ’—when the nourishing is correct, there will be good fortune. ‘We must look at what we are seeking to nourish :’~we must look at those whom we wish to nourish. ‘ We must by the exercise of our thoughts seek the proper aliment:’ — we must look to our own nourishing of ourselves. 2. Heaven and earth nourish all things. The sages nourish men of talents and virtue, by them to reach to the myriads of the people. Great is (the work intended by this) nourishing in its time! XXVI. In paragraph 1, Tfi Khh evidently means the ‘grand accumulation ’ of virtue, indicated by the attributes of its compo nent trigrams. ‘Substantial solidity’ may very well be given as the attribute of mountains. ‘The strong line in the highest place’ of paragraph 2 is line 6, whose subject is thus above the ruler represented by 5, and has the open firmament for his range in doing his work. This, and his ability to repress the strongest opposition, show how he is sup ported by all that is correct and right. In a kingdom where the object of the government is the accumu lation of virtue, good and able men will not be left in obscurity. What will not a high and good purpose, supported by the greatest strength, be able to do? XXVII. Many of the critics, in illustration of paragraph 1, refer appropriately to Mencius, VI, i, chap. 14. In illustration of paragraph 2 they refer to the times and court of Yfio and Shun, sage rulers, from whose cherishing and nourishing came Yu to assuage the waters of the deluge, to teach the people agriculture, Hsieh as minister of instruction, Kao Yao as minister of crime, and othersall to do the work of nourishing the people. THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I. 2 37 XXVIII. 1. Ta Kwo shows the great ones (— the undivided lines) in excess. 2. In ' the beam that is weak ’ we see weakness both in the lowest and the topmost (lines). F. 3. The strong lines are in excess, but (two of them) are in the central positions. The action (of the hexagram is represented by the symbols of) flexibility and satisfaction. (Hence it is said), ‘ There will be advantage in moving in any direc tion whatever; yea, there will be success.’ 4. Great indeed is (the work to be done in) this very extraordinary time, j XXIX. 1.

In the Great Symbolism ‘ wood ’ appears as the natural object symbolised by Sun, and not ‘ wind,’ which we find more commonly, The attribute of 1 flexibility,’ however, is the quality of Sun, whether used of wind or of wood, Paragraph 4, Such a time, it is said, was that of Yflo and Shun, of 4 hang the Successful, and of king Wfl. What these heroes did, however, was all called for by the exigency of their times, and not by whim or principle of their own, which they wished to make prominent, HEX. 30. tains, rivers, hills, and mounds. Kings and princes arrange, by means of such strengths, to maintain their territories. Great indeed is the use of (what is here) taught about seasons of peril. XXX. 1. Li means being attached to. The sun and moon have their place in the sky. All the grains, grass, and trees have their place on the earth. The double brightness (of the two tri grams) adheres to what is correct, and the result is the transforming and perfecting all under the sky. 2. The weak (second line) occupies the middle and correct position, and gives the indication of f a free and successful course; ’ and, moreover, ‘ nourish ing (docility like that of) the cow ’ will lead to good fortune, XXIX. On paragraph 2 Liang Yin says‘ Water stops at the proper time, and moves at the proper time. Is not this an emblem of the course of the superior man in dealing with danger ?' On paragraph 4 the Khang-hsi editors say that to exercise one's self in meeting difficulty and peril is the way to establish and strengthen the character, and that the use of such experience is seen in all measures for self-defence, there being no helmet and mail like leal-heartedness and good faith, and no shield and tower like propriety and righteousness. XXX. 'The double brightness’ in paragraph x has been much discussed. Some say that it means 1 the ruler, becoming brighter and brighter. Others say that it means both the ruler and his ministers, combining their brightness. The former view seems to me the better. The analogy between the natural objects and a transforming and perfecting rule is far fetched. < The central and correct position ’ in paragraph 2 can be said only of the second line, and not of the fifth, where an undivided line would be more correct. The ‘and moreover’ of the translation is ' therefore ’ in the original; but I cannot make out the force and suitability of that conjunction. 23B THE APPENDIXES. Section II. XXXI. i. Hsien is here used in the sense of Kan, meaning (mutually) influencing. 2. The weak (trigram) above, and the strong one below; their two influences moving and respond ing to each other, and thereby forming a union; the repression (of the one) and the satisfaction (of the other); (with their relative position), where the male is placed below the female:—-all these things convey the notion of ‘ a free and successful course (on the fulfilment of the conditions), while the advantage will depend on being firm and correct, as in marrying a young lady, and there will be good fortune.’ 3. Heaven and earth exert their influences, and there ensue the transformation and production of all things. The sages influence the minds of men, and the result is harmony and peace all under the sky. If we look at (the method and issues) of those influences, the true character of heaven and earth and of all things can be seen. XXXII. 1. Hang denotes long continuance. The strong (trigram) is above, and the weak one below; (they are the symbols of) thunder and wind, XXXI, Paragraph 2. Tui, the upper trigrain, is weak and yin; and Kan, the lower,is strong and yang; see Appendixes III, ii, 4, and V, 10. Kan is below Tui; whereas the subject of the lower trigram should always take the initiative in these figures. HEX. 32. APPENDIX I. 239 which are in mutual communication; (they have the qualities of) docility and motive force; their strong and weak (lines) all respond, each to the other these things are all found in Hang. 2. (When it is said that) ‘ Hang indicates success ful progress and no error (in what it denotes); but the advantage will come from being firm and correct,’ this indicates that there must be long continuance in its way of operation. The way of heaven and earth is to be long continued in their operation with out stopping. 3. (When it is said that) ‘Movement in any direction whatever will be advantageous,’ this im plies that when (the moving power) is spent, it will begin again. 4. The sun and moon, realising in themselves (the course of Heaven), can perpetuate their shining. The four seasons, by their changing and trans forming, can perpetuate their production (of things). The sages persevere long in their course, and all under the sky are transformed and perfect. When we look at what they continue doing long, the natural tendencies of heaven, earth, and all things can be seen. XXXII. All the conditions in paragraph 1 must he understood as leading to the indication of progress and success, which is explained in paragraph 2, and illustrated by the analogy of the course of heaven and earth. , ,. ‘ Movement in any direction,’ as explained in paragraph 3, in 1- cates the ever-occurring new mote and spheres of activity, to which he who is firm and correct is called. Paragraph 4, and especially its concluding sentence are of a meditativriand reflective character not uncommon in the treanse on the Thwan. 240 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. II. XXXIII. i. ‘Thun indicates successful pro gress : ’—that is, in the very retiring which Thun denotes there is such progress.

The action takes place according to (the requirement of) the time. | 2. ‘To a small extent it will (still) be advan- S' tageous to be firm and correct:'—(the small men) ■ are gradually encroaching and advancing. 3. Great indeed is the significance of (what is j required to be done in) the time that necessitates retiring. | XXXIV. 1. In Ta /Twang we see that which is great becoming strong. We have the (trigram) denoting strength directing that which denotes movement, and hence (the whole) is expressive of . j vigour. T 2. ‘Ta /Twang indicates that it will be advan tageous to be firm and correct:’—that which is great j (should be) correct. Given correctness and great ness (in their highest degree), and the character and ! tendencies of heaven and earth can be seen. . ■ ■ j XXXIII. ‘The superior man,’ it is said, ‘ advances or withdraws i according to the character of the time. The strength and correct position of the fifth line show that he is able to maintain himself; and as it is responded to by the weak second line, no opposition to what is correct in him would come from any others. He might therefore keep his place; but looking at the two weak lines, 1 and 2, he recognises in them the advance and irrepressible progress of small men, and that for a time it is better for him to give way and withdraw from the field. Thus there is successful progress I even in his retiring,’ I XXXIV, Paragraph 1. ‘That which is great’ denotes, in the i first place, the group of four strong lines which strikes us on hex. 36. APPENDIX I. 241 XXXV. 1. Bin denotes advancing. 2. (In Bin we have) the bright (sun) appearing above the earth; (the symbol of) docile submission cleaving to that of the Great brightness; and the weak line advanced and moving aboveall these things give us the idea of ‘ a prince who secures the tranquillity (of the people), presented on that ac count with numerous horses (by the king), and three times in a day received at interviews.’ XXXVI. 1. (The symbol of) the Earth and that of Brightness entering into the midst of it give the idea of Ming t (Brightness wounded or obscured). 2. The inner (trigram) denotes being accom plished and bright; the outer, being pliant and sub missive. The case of king Wan was that of one looking at the figure, and then the superior man, or the strong men in positions of power, of whom these are the representatives. Klnen is the trigram of strength, and Aan that of movement. Paragraph 2. ‘ That which is great (should be) correct: ’—that the ‘should be’ must be supplied in the translation appears from this, that the paragraph is intended to illustrate the text that 1 it will be advantageous to be firm and correct.’ The power of man becomes then a reflexion of the great power which we see working in nature, ‘ impartially,’ ‘ unselfishly.’ XXXV. To those who advocate the view that the hexagrams of the Yi have been formed by changes of the lines in manipulating with the divining stalks, the words of paragraph 2, that we have in the figure 1 the weak line advanced and moving above,’ suggest the derivation of 3 in from Kwan, whose 4th and 5th lines are made to change places (=~= j. But we have seen that that view is inadmissible in the interpretation of the Yi. And a simple explana tion of the language at once presents itself. As Hsiang An-shih (Sung dynasty) says, ‘ Of the three “ daughter ’ trigrams it is only L! which has its divided line occupying the central place of honour, when it is the upper trigram in a hexagram.’ THE APPENDIXES. who with these qualities was yet involved in great difficulties. 3. ' It will be advantageous to realise the difficulty (of the position), and maintain firm correctness: that is, (the individual concerned) should obscure his brightness. The case of the count of K i was that of one who, amidst the difficulties of his House, was able (thus) to maintain his aim and mind correct. XXXVII. 1. In K\\i Zan the wife has her correct place in the inner (trigram), and the man his correct place in the outer. That man and woman occupy their correct places is the great righteousness shown (in the relation and positions of) heaven and earth. 2. InlCii Z an we have the idea of an authori tative ruler;—that, namely, represented by the parental authority. 3. Let the father be indeed father, and the son son; let the elder brother be indeed elder brother, and the younger brother younger brother; let the husband be indeed husband, and the wife wife:— then will the family be in its normal state. Bring the family to that state, and all under heaven will be established. XXXVI, The sun disappearing, as we say,‘ below the earth/ or, as the Chinese writer conceives it, ‘into the midst of, or within the earth/ sufficiently indicates the obscuration or wounding of bright ness,—the repression and resistance of the good and bright. King Wan was not of the line of Shang. Though opposed and persecuted by its sovereign, he could pursue his own course, till his line came in the end to supersede the other. It could not be so with the count of Ki, who was a member of the House of Shang, He could do nothing that would help on its downfall. XXXVII, Paragraph 1 first explains the statement of the hex. 38. APPENDIX I. XXXVIII. 1. Iii Khwei we have (the symbol of) Fire, which, when moved, tends upwards, and that of a Marsh, whose waters, when moved, tend down wards. We have (also the symbols of) two sisters living together, but whose wills do not move in the same direction. 2. (We see how the inner trigram expressive of) harmonious satisfaction is attached to (the outer expressive of) bright intelligence; (we see) the weak line advanced and acting above, and how it occupies the central place, and is responded to by the strong (line below). These indications show that ‘in small matters there will (still) be good fortune/ 3. Heaven and earth are separate and apart, but the work which they do is the same. Male and female are separate and apart, but with a common will they seek the same object. There is diversity between the myriad classes of beings, but there is an analogy between their several operations. Great indeed are the phenomena and the results of this condition of disunion and separation. Th wan, about the wife, represented by line 2; and then proceeds to the husband, represented by line 5. The two trigrams become representative of the family circle, and the wide world without it. In the reference to heaven and earth it is not supposed that they are really husband and wife; but in their relation and positions they symbolise that social relation and the individuals in it. Paragraph 2, more closely rendered, would be—‘That in /Via Zan there is an authoritative ruler is a way of naming father and mother/ Does the writer mean to say that while the assertion of authority was indispensable in a family, that authority must have combined in it both force and gentleness ? XXXVIII. In paragraph 1 we have first an explanation of the meaning of Khwei from the symbolism of Fft-hst. Then follows THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I. SECT, II, XXXIX. I. Zien denotes difficulty. There is (the trigram expressive of) perilousness in front. When one, seeing the peril, can arrest his steps (in accordance with the significance of the lower tri gram), is he not wise ? 2. (The language of) Wien, that ‘advantage will be found in the south-west,’ refers to the (strong fifth line) advanced and in the central place. That ‘there will be no advantage in the north-east,’ intimates that the way (of dealing with the Wien state) is exhausted. That ‘ it will be advantageous to see the great man,’ intimates that advance will lead to achievement. That the places (of the different lines after the first) are those appropriate to them indicates firm correctness and good fortune, with which the regions (of the kingdom) are brought to their normal state. Great indeed is the work to be done in the time of Wien! I HEX. 40. XL. i. In Wieh we have (the trigram expressive of) peril going on to that expressive of movement. By movement there is an escape from the peril ‘ (this is the meaning of) Wieh. I 2. ‘ In (the state indicated by) Wieh, advantage [ will be found in the south-west:’—-the movement (thus) intimated will win all. That ‘ there will be ; good fortune in coming back (to the old condi tions)’ shows that such action is that of the due medium. That ‘if some operations be necessary, there will be good fortune in the early conducting of them ’ shows that such operations will be successful. 3. When heaven and earth are freed (from the grasp of winter), we have thunder and rain. When these come, the buds of the plants and trees that produce the various fruits begin to burst. Great indeed are the phenomena in the time intimated by Wieh. an explanation from that ascribed to king Wan, where Tui repre sents the youngest daughter and Li the second. The Khang-hsi editors observe that in many hexagrams we have two daughters dwelling together, but that only in this and 49 is attention called to it. The reason, they say, is that in those two diagrams the sisters are the second and third daughters, while in the others one of them is the eldest, whose place and superiority are fixed, so that between her and either of the others there can be no division or collision. About what is said, in paragraph 2, on the weak line, as ad vanced and acting above, see the note on hexagram 35. The lesson of paragraph 3 is not unity in diversity, but union with diversity. XXXIX. The upper or front trigram is Khfin, the attribute of w ich is perilousness; the lower is Kan, of which the arresting, actively or passively, of movement or advance is the attribute. We can understand how the union of these attributes gives the ideas of dimculty and prudent caution. The explanations in paragraph 2 of the phraseologyof the Th wa n are not all easily followed. It is said that the advantageousness of the south-west is due to the central line in 5; but if we are to look for the meaning of south-west in Khwan, as in the diagram of king Wan’s trigrams, there is no strong central line in it. • May Kb fin, as a yang trigram, be used for Khwan? XL. 1. The meaning of the hexagram is brought out sufficiently well in paragraph x by means of the attributes of the constituent trigrams. 2. How it is that the movement indicated in the first condition will 1 win ’ all does not immediately appear. The Khan^-hsi editors say that ‘ moving to the south and west ’ is the same as * returning back to the old conditions/ and that ‘winning all and acting ‘ according to the due medium ' are descriptive of the effect and method without reference to the symbolism. Another explanation might be devised; but I prefer to leave the matter in doubt. 3. Paragraph 3 shows the analogy of what takes place in nature to the beneficent social and political changes described in the text, as is done very frequently in this Appendix. THE APPENDIXES. SECT. ir. APPENDIX I. XLI. 1. In Sun (we see) the lower (trigram) j diminished, and the upper added to. (But) the method (of action) implied in this operates also ; above (or, mounts upwards (also) and operates). j 2. ‘ If there be sincerity in this method of dimi- I nution, there will be great good fortune; freedom ; from error; firmness and correctness that can be maintained; and advantage in every movement that shall be made. In what shall this (sincerity in the exercise of Sun) be employed? (Even) in sacrifice, two baskets of grain, (though there be nothing else), may be presented:’—for these two baskets there ought to be the fitting time. There is a time when the strong should be diminished, and the weak should be strengthened. Diminution and increase, overflowing and emptiness: —these take place in harmony with the conditions of the time. XLI. 1. All that we see is two undivided lines in the lower trigrain, and then a divided one, and exactly the opposite in the upper. But the whole figure could not but have this form from the process of its formation, whether by the gradual addition of the two primitive lines, or by the imposition of the whole trigrams on one another. To say that the upper lines of Khxtn. and Khwan changed places to express the idea of subjects contributing in taxes to the main tenance of their ruler is absurd; and if that thought were in the mind of king Wan (which I very much doubt), it would only show how he projected his own idea, formed independently of the figure, into its lines. On the second sentence, the Khang-hsi editors say' When a minister devotes his life in the service of his lord, or the people undertake their various labours in behalf of their government, these are instances of the ministering of those below to increase those above. But in this way the intercourse of the two becomes close and their aims become the same;—does not the method of action of those below communicate itself to those above ? ’ In paragraph 2 the subject of contribution, such as the payment of HEX. 42. XLII. 1. Ill Yi we see the upper (trigram) diminished, and the lower added to. The satis faction of the people (in consequence of this) is without limit. What descends from above reaches to all below, so great and brilliant is the course (of its operation). 2. That ‘ there will be advantage in every move ment which shall be undertaken ’ appears from the central and correct (positions of the second and fifth lines), and the (general) blessing (the dispensing of which they imply). That ‘it will be advantageous (even) to cross the great stream ’ appears from the action of wood (shown in the figure). 3. Yi is made up of (the trigrams expressive of) movement and docility, (through which) there is daily advancement to an unlimited extent. We have (also) in it heaven dispensing and earth pro ducing, leading to an increase without restriction taxes, passes into the background. The Khang-hsi editors say ' What is meant by diminishing in this hexagram is the regu lation of expenditure or contribution according to the time. This would vary in a family according to its poverty or wealth; and in a state according to the abundance or scantiness of its resources. When it is said that there must be sincerity along with a diminu tion, it means that though such a diminution cannot be helped, yet what is given should be given sincerely. A small sacrifice sincerely offered is accepted. In the language,\" There is a time when the strong should be diminished and the weak be strengthened,” we are not to find the two baskets in the diminution of the strong. “ The strong” is what is essential,—in this case sincerity; “The weak” is what is unimportant,—the amount and manner of the offering. If one supplement the insufficiency of his offering with the abun dance of his sincerity, the insignificance of his two baskets will not be despised.’ THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I. of place. Everything in the method of this increase proceeds according to the requirements of the time. XLII, 1. The process of the formation of the trigrams here is the reverse of that in the preceding hexagram; and is open to the I remarks I have made on that. Of course the people are full of complacency and pleasure in the labours of their ruler for their ! good. 2. The mention of'the action of wood' has reference to the upper trigram Sun, which is the symbol both of wind and wood. From wood boats and ships are made, on which the great stream may be crossed. In three hexagrams, this, 59, and 6r, of which Sun is a part, we find mention made of crossing the great stream. It is generally said that the lower trigram Ain also symbolises wood; but that is obtained by a roundabout process. Jan occu pies the place of the east in Wan's arrangement of the trig-rams; but the east symbolises spring, when the growth of vegetation begins; and therefore Jan may symbolise wood 1 It was slated on p. 33, that the doctrine of ‘ the five elements ’ does not appear in the Yi, J/Angqze takes wood mfi), ‘as a misprint for increase yi).’ 3, The words ‘heaven dispensing and earth producing’ are based on the fan cied genesis of the figure from J/iien and i Khwan|-— —-1 the first lines in each changing places. It was the author of this Appendix, probably, who first introduced that absurd notion in connexion with the formation of Sun andYi. One rhyme runs through and connects these three paragraphs thus 4 Y! spoils the high, gives to the low; The people feel intense delight. Down from above to all below, The blessing goes, so large and bright. Success will every movement mark, Central its source, its course aright.

We see (in the figure) the strong (lines) displacing the weak. (We have in it the attributes of) strength and complacency. There is displacement, but harmony (continues). 2. ‘ The exhibition (of the criminal’s guilt) in the royal courtyard’ is suggested by the (one) weak (line) mounted on the five strong lines. There 1 is an earnest and sincere appeal (for sym pathy and support), and a consciousness of the peril (involved in the undertaking)it is the realisation of this danger, which makes the method (of compass ing the object) brilliant. ‘He should make an announcement in his own city, and show that it will not be well to have recourse at once to arms: ’—(if he have recourse to arms), what he prefers will (soon) be exhausted. * There will be advantage in whatever he shall go forward to: ’—when the growth of the strong (lines) has been completed, there will be an end (of the displacement). And ceaselessly it hastens on, Each season's gifts quick to requite.’ XLIII. 1. The last clause of paragraph 1 is good in itself, show ing that the strong and worthy statesman in removing a bad man from the state is not actuated by any private feelings. The senti ment, however, as it is expressed, can hardly be said to follow from the symbolism. Paragraph 2. The same may be said of all the notes appended to the different clauses of this second paragraph. HU Pmg-wan (YUan dynasty) says:-‘If but a single small man be left, he is sufficient to make the superior man anxious; if but a single inordi nate desire be left in the mind, that is sufficient to disturb the harmony of heavenly principles. The eradication in both cases must be complete, before the labour is ended. THE APPENDIXES. XLIV. i. Kau has the significance of unex pectedly coming on. (We see in it) the weak (line) coming unexpectedly on the strong ones. 2. ‘It will not be good to marry (such) a female:’-—one (so symbolised) should not be long- associated with. 3. Heaven and earth meeting together (as here represented), all the variety of natural things become fully displayed. 4. When a strong (line) finds itself in the central and correct position, (good government) will greatly prevail all under the sky. 5. Great indeed is the significance of what has to be done at the time indicated by Kfiu! XLV. 1. 3 hui indicates (the condition of union, or) being collected. We have in it (the symbol of) docile obedience going on to (what is expressed by that of) satisfaction. There is the strong line in the central place, and rightly responded to. Hence comes the (idea of) union. 2. ‘ The king will repair to his ancestral temple: XLIV. On paragraph 1 the Khang-hsi editors say‘ “ The weak line meets with (or comes unexpectedly on) the strong ones;\"— the weak line, that is, plays the principal part. The case is like that of the minister who assumes the power of deciding for himself on all measures, or of a hen’s announcing the morningis not the name of (shameless) boldness rightly applied to it f Hence nothing more is said about the symbol of the bold female; but attention is called to the second part of the Thwan,’ Paragraph 2 needs no remark. Paragraphs 3,4, and 5 all speak of the importance of powers and parties meeting together,—in the world of nature, and in the sphere of human affairs. But I do not see how this sentiment is a natural sequel to that in 1 and 2, nor that it has any connexion with the teaching of the Thwan and Symbolism, HEX. 46. APPENDIX I. with the utmost filial piety he presents his offerings (to the spirits of his ancestors). ‘It will be advantageous to meet the great man, and there will then be prosperity and success: the union effected by him will be on and through what is correct. ‘The use of great victims will conduce to good fortune; and in whatsoever direction movement is made, it will be advantageous: ’—all is done in accordance with the ordinances of Heaven. 3. When we look at the way in which the gather ings (here shown) take place, the natural tendencies (in the outward action) of heaven and earth and of all things can be seen. XLVI. 1. (We find) the weak (line), as it finds the opportunity, ascending upwards. 2. We have (the attribute) of flexibility and that of obedience; we have the strong line (below) and its proper correlate abovethese things indicate that there will be ‘ great progress and success.’ XLV. The lower trigram in fthui is Khwan, whose attribute is docile obedience; and the upper isTui, whose attribute is pleased satisfaction. Then we have the strong line in 5, and its proper correlate in 2. These things may give the idea of union. They might also give the idea of other good things. The Khang-hsi editors say that though 1 all is done in accord ance with the ordinances of Pleaven’ follows the concluding clauses of the Thwan, yet the sentiment of the words must be extended to the other clauses as well. jOang-jze says that ‘ the ordinances of Heaven ’ are simply the natural and practical outcome of‘heavenly principle;'—in this case what should and may be done according to the conditions and requirements of the time. So do,the critics of China try to shirk the idea of personality in ‘Heaven.’ With paragraph 3, compare the concluding paragraphs of the Thwan ifwan on hexagrams 31,32. 252 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. n. 3. ‘Seeking (by the qualities implied in Shang) to meet with the great man, its subject need have no anxiety: ’—there will be ground for congratulation. ‘Advance to the south will be fortunate:’—his aim will be carried out. XLVII. 1. In Khwan (we see) the strong (lines) covered and obscured (by the weak). 2. We have in it (the attribute of) perilousness going on to that of satisfaction. Who is it but the superior man that, though straitened, still does not fail in making progress to his proper end ? ‘ For the firm and correct, the (really) great man, there will be good fortune: ’—this is shown by the central positions of the strong (lines). ‘ If he make speeches, his words cannot be made good: ’— to be fond of arguing or pleading is the way to be reduced to extremity, XLVL The explanation of the first paragraph has given occasion to much difference of opinion. Some will have' the weak (line) ’ to be 4; some 5; and some the whole of Khwan, the upper trigram, The advocates of 4, make it come from hexagram 40, the weak 3 of which ascends to the strong 4, displaces it, and takes its place ; but w r e have seen repeatedly the folly of the doctrine of changing lines and figures. 1 he great symbolism of Appendix II suggests the proper explanation. The lower trigram, Sun, represents here not wind but wood. The first line, weak, is the root of a tree planted beneath the earth. Its gradual growth symbolises the advance upwards of the subject of the hexagram, fostered, that is, by the circumstances of the time. XLVII. I, One sees the relative position of the strong and weak lines in the figure; but to deduce from that the idea expressed by Khwan requires a painful straining of the imagination. That idea was in the mind, and then the lines were interpreted accordingly. 2, Perilousness is the attribute of the lower trigram, and ‘ satis faction that of the upper. The superior man, however straitened, HEX. 49. APPENDIX I. XLVIII. 1. (We have the symbol of) wood in the water and the raising of the water; which (gives us the idea of) a well. A well supplies nourishment and is not (itself) exhausted. 2. ‘ The site of a town may be changed, while the fashion of its wells undergoes no change:’— this is indicated by the central position of the strong lines (in the second and fifth places). ‘The drawing is nearly accomplished, but the rope has not yet reached the water of the well: ’— its service has not yet been accomplished. ‘The bucket is broken:’ —it is this that occa sions evil. XLIX. 1. In Ko (we see) water and fire extin guishing each other; (we see also) two daughters dwelling together, but with their minds directed to remains master of himself, and pursues the proper end of principle settled in his mind. Why should the subject of Khwan make speeches, be fond of arguing or pleading,—as the characters say, if we could translate them literally, ‘ setting a value on the mouth ?' The reply to this is found in the trigram denoting ‘satisfaction,’ or ‘being pleased,’ The party in the extremity of Khwan yet wishes and tries to make men pleased with him. XLVIII. /fang Khang-ZMng says :-‘Khan, the upper trigram, represents water, and Sun, the lower, wood. This wood denotes the water-wheel or pulley with its bucket, which descends into the mouth of the spring, and brings the water up to the top. This may be a correct explanation of the figure, though the reading of it from bottom to top seems at first to be strange. Paragraph 2. That the fashion of the well does not undergo any (great) change is dwelt upon as illustrating the unchangeable ness of the great principles of human nature and of government. But that this truth may be learned from the strong and central lines only produces a smile. So do the remarks on the other two sentences of the Thwan. THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I. SECT. ir. different objects:—(on account of these things) it is called (the hexagram of) Change. 2. ‘It is believed in (only) after it has been accomplished: ’—when the change has been made, faith is accorded to it. (We have) cultivated intelligence (as the basis of) pleased satisfaction, (suggesting) ‘ great progress and success,’ coming from what is correct. When change thus takes place in the proper way, ‘ occasion for repentance disappears.’ 3. Heaven and earth undergo their changes, and the four seasons complete their functions. Thang changed the appointment (of the line of Hsid to the throne), and Wft (that of the line of Shang), in accordance with (the will of) Heaven, and in response to (the wishes of) men. Great indeed is what takes place in a time of change. L. 1, In Ting we have (symbolically) the figure of a caldron. (We see) the (symbol of) wood enter ing into that of fire, which suggests the idea of cook' XLIX. Paragraph 1, Lf, the lower trigram, represents fire, and 1 ui, the upper, represents water. Water will extinguish fire, and fiie again will dry up water. Each, to all appearance, produces a change in the other. Again, according to king Wan's scheme of the trigrams, as shown on p. 33, and in Figure 1, Plate III, LI is the second, and Tui the youngest daughter. Their wills are likely to differ in love and other things; but this symbolism does not so readily suggest the idea of change. 2, The first sentence suggests how the dislike to change on the part of people generally is overcome. The second suggests how change proceeding from intelligence and giving general satisfaction will be successful. Paragraph 3 tells us how the greatest natural and the greatest political changes are equally successful and admirable when con ducted aright. HEX, gl. ing. The sages cooked their offerings in order to present them to God, and made great feasts to nourish their wise and able (ministers). 2. We have (the symbol of) flexible obedience, and that (which denotes) ears quick of hearing and eyes clear-sighted. (We have also) the weak (line) advanced and acting above, in the central place, and responded to by the strong (line below). All these things give the idea of ‘ great progress and success.’ LI. 1. iTan (gives the intimation of) ease and development. 2. ‘When the (time of) movement (which it indicates) comes, (its subject) will be found looking out with apprehension: ’—that feeling of dread leads to happiness. ‘ And yet smiling and talking cheer fully : ’—the issue (of his dread) is that he adopts (proper) laws (for his course). ‘ The movement (like a crash of thunder) terrifies L. 1. See the notes on the Text of the Thwan about the figure of a caldron in Ting. Its component trigrams are Sun representing wood, and Li representing fire; which may very well suggest the idea of cooking. The last sentence of the paragraph is entirely after the style of ‘ the Great Symbolism.’ The Khang- hsi editors say that the distinction between Bing and Ting appears here very clearly, the former relating to the nourishment of the people, and the latter to the nourishing men of worth. They add that the reality of the offerings to God is such nourishing. ‘ God' is here Shang Ti, which Canon McClatchie translates 'the First Emperor,’ adding in a note,' The Chinese Jupiter, the Emperor of gods and men! ’ 2, The first sentence deduces the sentiment of the Thwan from the attributes or virtues of the trigrams with considerable amplifica tion of the virtue of Lf. The second line of Li, as being divided, calls forth in other hexagrams the same notice as here. It is the most important line in the figure, and being responded to by the strong 2, gives an indication of the ‘great progress and success. 256 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. II. all within a hundred 11: ’—it startles the distant and frightens the near. ‘He will be like the sincere worshipper, who is not startled into letting go his ladle and cup of sacrificial spirits:’—he makes his appearance, and maintains his ancestral temple and the altars of the spirits of the land and grain, as presiding at all sacrifices. LII. 1. Kan denotes stopping or resting-;— resting when it is the time to rest, and acting when it is the time to act. When one’s movements and restings all take place at the proper time for them, his way (of proceeding) is brilliant and intelligent. 2. Resting in one’s resting-point is resting in one’s proper place. The upper and lower (lines of the hexagram) exactly correspond to each other, but are without any interaction; hence it is said that ‘ (the subject of the hexagram) has no consciousness of self; that when he walks in his courtyard, he does not see (any of) the persons in it; and that there will be no error.’ LI. Paragraph 1. See what is said on the Text. 2. The explanations of the Thwan here are good; but in no way deduced from the figure, 3. The portion of the text printed in a different type is supposed to have dropt out of the Chinese copies. The explanation of it that follows is based on Wan’s view of Xan as representing the oldest son. See on the Text, LII, 1. The Khang-hsf editors give their opinion that what is said in the first sentence of this paragraph, after the explanation of the name, illustrates the first sentence of the Thwan, and that the other sentence illustrates the rest of the Thwan. It may be so, but the whole of the Thwan appears in paragraph 2, 2. The hexagram being made up of Kan repeated, lines x, 2,3 are of course the same as 4,5, and 6. But it will be seen that there is not a proper correlation among them all. I do not see, hex. 54. APPENDIX I. 2 57 LIII. 1. The advance indicated by Wien is (like) the marrying of a young lady which is attended by good fortune. 2. (The lines) as they advance get into their correct placesthis indicates the achievements of a successful progress. The advance is made according to correctness (the subject of the hexagram) might rectify his country. 3. Among the places (of the hexagram) we see the strong undivided line in the centre. 4. ‘In (the attributes of) restfulness and flexible penetration we have (the assurance of) an (onward) movement that is inexhaustible. LIV. 1. By Kwei Mei (the marrying away of a younger sister) the great and righteous relation between heaven and earth (is suggested to us). If heaven and earth were to have no intercommunica tion, things would not grow and flourish as they do. The marriage of a younger sister is the end (of her maidenhood) and the beginning (of her mother hood). 2. We have (in the hexagram the desire of) however, that this furnishes any ground for the entire obliviousness of self, which the Thwan makes out to be in the figure. LIII. The first sentence of paragraph 2 describes the lines from a to 5 all getting into their proper places, as has been pointed out on the Text, and that sentence is symbolical of what is said in the second. 1 The rectification of the country 1 is the reality of ‘ the successful progress.’ ' The strong undivided line ’ in paragraph 3 is the fifth of the figure. Out of rest comes movement to go on for an indefinite time, and be succeeded by rest againas says paragraph 4. 258 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. n. pleasure and, on the ground of that, movement following. The marrying away is of a younger sister. 3. ‘ Any action will be evil: ’—the places (of the lines) are not those appropriate to them. ‘ It will be in no wise advantageous: ’—the weak (third and fifth lines) are mounted on strong lines. LV. 1. Fang has the signification of being great. It is made up of the trigrams (representing) LIV. x. Kwei Mei in this Appendix has the meaning simply of marriage, and for Mei we might substitute Nii, ‘daughter’ or ‘young lady.’ This appears from the writer’s going on to point out, as elsewhere, the analogy between the growth of things in nature from the interaction of heaven and earth and the increase of mankind through marriage. He does this with a delicate touch. There is no grossness in the original any more than there is in the translation, But how are we to reconcile this reference to the action of heaven and earth with the bad auspice of the Thwan? The Khang-hsi editors felt the pressure of this difficulty, and they adduce a similar inconsistency in the account of hexagram 44 in this treatise, adding, ‘From this we may say that the interaction of the yin and yang cannot be dispensed with, but that we ought to be careful about it in the beginning in order to prevent mischief in the end. This is the doctrine of the Yi.' This is very well, but it is no solution of the difficulty. The editors could not admit that the author of the Appendix did not understand or did not deal fairly with the Text; for that author, they thought, was Confucius. 2. The same editors say that paragraph 2 implies both that the desire for the marriage originated with the lady, and that she was aware that the gentleman was older than herself. 3. The position of a divided line above an undivided is always repiesented as an evil omen; it is difficult to understand why. There is less of an appearance of reason about it than in some other things which are said about the lines. The lines are where they cannot but be from the way in which the figures were formed. HEX. 56. APPENDIX I. intelligence and movement directed by that intel ligence. It is thus that it has that signification. 2. ‘ The king has reached the condition (denoted by Fang):’—he has still to make it greater. ‘ There is no occasion to be anxious. Let him be as the sun at noon—it is for him to cause his light to shine on all under the sky. 3, When the sun has reached the meridian height, it begins to decline. When the moon has become full, it begins to wane. The (interaction of) heaven and earth is now vigorous and abundant, now dull and scanty, growing and diminishing according to the seasons. How much more must it be so with (the operations of) men! How much more also with the spiritual agency! LVI. 1. ‘ Lii indicates that there may be some small attainment and progress:'—the weak (line) occupies the central place in the outer (trigram), and is obedient to the strong (lines on either side of it). (We have also the attributes of quiet) resting closely attached to intelligence (in the com- LY. The Khang-hsi editors remark that paragraph 1 is not so much explaining the meaning of the name Fang, as accounting for the hexagram, composed of Li and Alan, having such a meaning. Paragraph 3 seems rather contrary to the lesson of the hexa gram. According to it, prosperity cannot be maintained, any more than we can have the other seasons without winter or perpetual day without night; but the object of the essay is to exhort to the maintenance of prosperity. Is it the case that the rise of every commonwealth and cause must be followed by its decay and fall ? The mind refuses to admit the changes of the seasons, &c., as a true analogy for all moral and intellectual movements. See an important remark on the concluding sentence in the Introduction, PP- 34 . 35 - 260 the APPENDIXES. SECT. II. ponent trigrams). Hence it is said, ‘ There may be some small attainment and progress. If the stranger or traveller be firm and correct as he ought to be, there will be good fortune.’ 2. Great is the time and great is the right course to be taken as intimated in Lii! LVII. i. The double Sun shows how, in accord ance with it, (governmental) orders are reiterated. 2. (We see that) the strong (fifth line) has pene’ trated into the central and correct place, and the will (of its subject) is being carried into effect; (we see also) the weak (first and fourth lines) both obedient to the strong lines (above them). It is hence said, ‘ There will -be some little attainment and progress. There will be advantage in move ment onward in whatever direction. It will be advantageous also to see the great man.’ LVI. What is said in paragraph i is intended to explain the Thwan, and not to account for the meaning of the name L Q. It is assumed that Ltl means a stranger; and the writer from the position of the fifth line, and from the attributes of the component trigrams, derives the ideas of humility, docility, a quiet restfulness, and intelligence as the characteristics proper to a stranger, and which are likely to lead to his attaining what he desires, and then advancing. LVII. I. The language of this paragraph has often occurred to me in reading commands and addresses issued by the emperors of China, such as the essays on the precepts in what is called the Sacred Edict, the reiteration employed in many of which is re markable. Paragraph 2.

(We have) the strong (lines) in the centre, and the weak (lines) on the outer edge (of the two tri grams), (indicating that) in pleasure what is most advantageous is the maintenance of firm correctness. Through this there will be found an accordance with (the will of) heaven, and a correspondence with (the feelings of) men. When (such) pleasure goes before the people, (and leads them on), they forget their toils; when it animates them in encountering diffi culties, they forget (the risk of) death. How great is (the power of) this pleased satisfaction, stimulating in such a way the people! LIX. 1. ‘Hwan intimates that there will be progress and success(we see) the strong line (in the second place) of the lower trigram, and not suffering any extinction there; and (also) the weak line occupying its place in the outer trigram, and uniting (its action) with that of the line above. 2. 1 The king goes to his ancestral temple: ’—the king’s (mind) is without any deflection. 3. ‘It will be advantageous to cross the great stream:'—(the subject of the hexagram) rides in LVIII. The feeling of pleasure going before the people and leading them on to endure toil and encounter death must be sup posed to be produced in them by the example and lessons of their ruler. Lii Fafi-hsien paraphrases this portion of the text thus - ‘ When the sage with this precedes them, he can make them endure toil without any wish to decline it, and go with him into difficulty and danger without their having any fear.’ I think this was intended to be the teaching of the hexagram, but the positive expression of it is hardly discernible.

This paragraph has been partially anticipated in the notes on the Thwan, The second line is said to suffer ‘no extinction,' because the lower trigram is that of peril. The Khang- hsi editors say that the former part of this paragraph shows how the root of the work of the hexagram is strengthened, and the latter part how the execution of that work is secured. The conclusion of paragraph 2 is, literally, 1 The king indeed is in the middle, 1 This does not mean, as some say, that the king is \\ in the middle of the temple, but that his mind or heart is exactly set on the central truth of what is right and good. The upper trigram Sun represents both wind and wood. To explain the meaning of Hwan, the significance of wind is taken; the writer here seizes on that of wood, as furnishing materials for a boat in which the great stream can be crossed. LX. Paragraph 1. See what is said on the Text of the Thwan. LXI. 1. In Wung Fu we have the (two) weak lines in the innermost part (of the figure), and strong lines occupying the central places (in the trigrams). (We have the attributes) of pleased satisfaction and flexible penetration. Sincerity (thus symbolled) will transform a country. 2. ‘ Pigs and fish (are moved), and there will be good fortune: ’—sincerity reaches to (and affects even) pigs and fishes. ‘There will be advantage in crossing the great stream: ’—(we see in the figure) one riding on (the emblem of) wood, which forms an empty boat. 3. In (the exercise of the virtue denoted by) /sfung Ffi, (it is said that) ‘ there will be advantage in being firm and correct: ’—in that virtue indeed we have the response (of man) to Heaven. ‘Its course will come to an end’ is the opposite of the intima tion in ifieh of progress and attainment. In paragraph 3 the writer returns to this intimation of the figureby the attributes of the trigrams; by the appropriate positions of lines 4 and 5; and by the central and correct place of 5. Paragraph 4 illustrates the importance of doing things according to rule by reference to the operations of nature and the enactments and institutions of sage rulers. LXI. 1. The structure of the lineal figure which is here insisted on has been pointed out in explaining the Thwan. On what is further said as to the attributes of the trigrams and their effect, Z/iangqze observes:—‘ We have in the sincerity shown in the upper trigram superiors condescending to those below them in accordance with their peculiarities, and we have in that of the lower those below delighted to follow their superiors. The com bination of these two things leads to the transformation of the country and state.’ Paragraph 2.

Such ‘ exceeding, in order to its being advanta geous, must be associated with firmness and correct ness : ’—that is, it must take place (only) according to (the requirements of) the time. 3. The weak (lines) are in the central places, and hence (it is said that what the name denotes) may be done in small affairs, and there will be good fortune. 4. Of the strong (lines one) is not in its proper place, and (the other) is not central, hence it is said that (what the name denotes) ‘ should not be done in great affairs.’ 5. (In the hexagram) we have ‘the symbol of a bird on the wing, and of the notes that come down from such a bird, for which it is better to descend than to ascend, thereby leading to great good fortune: ’—to ascend is contrary to what is reason able in the case, while to descend is natural and right. empty boat, it is said (with doubtful truth), is not liable to be upset, The trigram S un symbolises both wind and wood.

For paragraphs 1 and 2, see the note on the Text of the Thwan. It is difficult to see the concatenation in paragraph 3 between the sentiment of the Thwan and the nature of the second line, The Khang-hsi editors compare this hexagram and the next with n and 12, observing that the goodness of Thai (11) is concen trated, as here, in the second line. The sentiment of paragraph 4 is that which we have often met with,—that things move on with a constant process of change. Disorder succeeds to order, and again order to disorder.

The superior man, in accordance with this, nerves himself to ceaseless activity. 1. ‘The dragon lies hid in the deep;—it is not the time for active doing: (this appears from) the strong and undivided line's being in the lowest place. .2. ‘The dragon appears in the field:’—the diffu sion of virtuous influence has been wide. 3. ‘ Active and vigilant all the day: ’—(this refers to) the treading of the (proper) path over and over again. 4. ‘ He seems to be leaping up, but is still in the deep: —if he advance, there will be no error. 5. ‘ The dragon is on the wing in the sky: ’—the great man rouses himself to his work. 6. ‘ The dragon exceeds the proper limits;— there will be occasion for repentance: ’—a state of fulness, that is, should not be indulged in long. 7. ‘The same undivided line is used’ (in all the places of this hexagram), but the attribute of heaven (thereby denoted) should not (always) take the foremost place. Like the Text under each hexagram, what is said under each in this treatise on its symbolism is divided into two portions. The THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX II. II. The (capacity and sustaining) power of the earth is what is denoted by Khwan. The superior man, in accordance with this, with his large virtue supports (men and) things. 1. ‘He is treading on hoarfrostthe strong ice will come (by and by): ’—-the cold (air) has begun to take form. Allow it to go on quietly according to its nature, and (the hoarfrost) will come to strong ice. 2. The movement indicated by the second line, divided, is ‘ from the straight (line) to the square.’ ‘(Its operation), without repeated effort, in every way advantageous,’ shows the brilliant result of the way of earth. 3. ‘ He keeps his excellence under restraint, but firmly maintains it:’—at the proper time he will manifest it. ‘ He may have occasion to engage in the king's service:’—great is the glory of his wisdom. first is called ‘the Great Symbolism,’ and is occupied with the trigrammatic composition of the hexagram, to the statement of which is always subjoined an exhibition of the use which should be, or has been, made of the lesson suggested by the meaning of the whole figure in the administration of affairs, or in self- government. If the treatise be rightly ascribed to Confucius, this practical application of the teaching of the symbols is eminently characteristic of his method in inculcating truth and duty; though we often find it difficult to trace the connexion between his premiss and conclusion. This portion of the treatise will be separated by a double space from what follows—‘the Lesser Symbolism,’ in the explanations of the several lines. I. A/nen is formed by redoubling the trigram of the same name, In the case of other hexagrams of similar formation, the repetition of the trigram is pointed out, That is not done here, according to M Hsf, ‘ because there is but one heaven.’ But the motion of heaven is a complete revolution every day, resumed again the next; so moves ‘the unwearied sun from day to day,’ making it a good symbol of renewed, untiring effort. HEX. 4. ‘ A sack tied upthere will be no error: ’— this shows how, through carefulness, no injury will be received. 5. ‘The yellow lower-garment;—there will be great good fortune: ’—this follows from that orna mental (colour’s) being in the right and central place. 6. ‘The dragons fight in the wild:’—the (on ward) course (indicated by Khwan) is pursued to extremity. 7. ‘(The lines are all weak and divided, as appears from) the use of the number six:’—but (those who are thus represented) becoming per petually correct and firm, there will thereby be a great consummation. II. Khwiin is formed by redoubling the trigram of the same name and having ‘the earth for its symbol.’ As in the former hexagram, the repetition is emphatic, not otherwise affecting the meaning of the hexagram, ‘ As there is but one heaven,’ says AT list, ‘so there is but one earth.’ The first part of ‘the Great Symbolism’ appears in Canon McClatchie’s version as—‘Khwan is the generative part of earth.’ By ‘generative part’ he probably means ‘ the productive or prolific faculty.’ If he mean anything else, there comes out a conclusion antagonistic to his own view of the ‘mythology’ of the Yi. The character Shi, which he trans lates by ‘generative part,’ is defined in Dr. Williams’ dictionary as ‘ the virility of males.’ Such is the special significance of it. If it were so used here, the earth would be masculine. It is difficult to say exactly what the writer meant by—‘The superior man, in accordance with this, and with his large nature, supports (men and) things.’ Lin Hst-yiian (Ming dynasty) says ‘ The superior man, in his single person, sustains the burden of all under the sky. The common people depend on him for their rest and enjoyment, Birds and beasts and creeping things, and the tribes of the vegetable kingdom, depend on him for the fulfilment of their destined being. If he be of a narrow mind and cold virtue, how can he help them ? Their hope in him would be in vain,’ ‘The Smaller Symbolism’ is sufficiently dealt with in the notes on the Text THE APPENDIXES. SECT, r. III. (The trigram representing) clouds and (that representing) thunder form Afun. The superior man, in accordance with this, ■ (adjusts his measures of government) as in sorting the threads of the warp and woof. 1. Although ‘there is a difficulty in advancing,’ the mind (of the subject of the line) is set on doing what is correct. While noble, he humbles himself to the mean, and grandly gains the people. 2. The difficulty (to the subject of) the second line, divided, arises from its place over the un divided line below it. ‘The union and children after ten years ’ shows things resuming their regular course. 3. ‘ One pursues the deer without the (guidance of the) forester: ’—(he does so) in (his eagerness to) follow the game. ‘ The superior man gives up the chase, (knowing that) if he go forward he will regret it: ’—he would be reduced to extremity. 4. ‘Going forward after such a search (for a helper)’ shows intelligence. 5. ‘ Difficulty is experienced (by the subject of the fifth line) in bestowing his rich favours:’—the extent to which they reach will not yet be con spicuous. 6, ‘He weeps tears of blood in streams:’—how can the state (thus emblemed) continue long ? III. Khan represents water, especially in the form of rain. Heie its symbol is a cloud. The whole hexagram seems to place us in the atmosphere of a thunderous sky overhung with thick and gloomy clouds, when we feel oppressed and distressed. This is not a bad emblem of the political state in the mind of the writer. When the thunder has pealed, and the clouds have discharged their HEX. 4. APPENDIX II. IV. (The trigram representing) a mountain, and beneath it that for a spring issuing forth from Mang, The superior man, in accordance with this, strives to be resolute in his conduct and nourishes his virtue. 1. ‘It will be advantageous to use punishment:’— the object being to bring under the influence of correcting law. 2. ‘A son able to (sustain the burden of) his family: ’—as appears from the reciprocation between this strong line and the weak (fifth line). 3. ‘ A woman (such as is here represented) should not be taken in marriage:—her conduct is not agreeable to what is right. 4. ‘ The regret arising from ignorance bound in chains’ is due to the special distance of (the subject of this line) from the solidity (shown in lines 2 and 6). 5. ‘The good fortune belonging to the simple lad without experience’ comes from his docility going on to humility. burden of rain, the atmosphere is cleared, and there is a feeling of relief. But I fail again to discern clearly the connexion between the symbolism and the lesson about the superior man’s admini stration of affairs. The subject of the first line of the Smaller Symbolism is repre sented by the undivided line, and therefore is firm and correct. He is noble, but his place is below the divided lines, symbols of the weak and mean (see Appendix IV, i, 1). Line 2. ‘ Things resume their regular course: ’—the subject is now at liberty to seek a union with the subject of line 5, according to the rules of the symbolism. Lines land 4, 2 and 5,3 and 6, the corresponding lines of the trigrams, are correlates. The subject of line 4 naturally recurs to the correlate in line 1. He is the natural helper in the case, and he has the ability. 272 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. r. 6. ‘Advantage will come from warding off in jury:’—(the subject of this line) above and (the ignorant) below, all do and are done to in accord ance with their nature. V. (The trigram for) clouds ascending over that IV. ‘The spring-here issuing forth' is different from the defile with a stream in it, in the explanation of the Thwan; different moreover from ‘rain/ mentioned also as the phenomenon which is the natural symbol of Khan. The presence of water, however, is common to the three. But the water of the spring, or of the stream, would flow away from the hill, and not be stopped by it; as an emblem therefore of the ignorance and inexperience denoted by Mang it is not suitable. Kh. Hst says that 1 the water of a spring is sure to move on and gradually advance.’ This may serve as a symbol of the general process and progress of education, though it gives no account of the symbolism of the hill. It serves also to explain in part the transition of the writer to the subject of the superior man, and his dealing apparently with himself. Does line 1 set forth the use of punishment as the dernier resort, undesirable, but possibly unavoidable, to bring men in subjection to law? The force of line 2 comes out fully in the Thwan. That a woman such as is represented in line 3 should not be taken in marriage is clear enough; but I do not see the bearing of the illustration on the proper lesson in the hexagram. Line 3 separates 4 from 2, and 5 separates it from 6. Weak in itself, it is farther removed than any other from the two strong lines in the hexagram, and is represented as ‘cribbed’ in its ignorance. The fifth is the most honourable place in the figure, and here is occupied by a weak line. This looks, however, to the occupant of line 2, less honourable than itself, and is marked by the two attri butes that are named. Compare what is said on line 2. A strong line in the topmost place must represent, according to the scheme of the hexagram, one who uses force in the cause of education; but the force is put forth not on the ignorant, but on t ose who would keep them ignorant, or increase their ignorance. The subject of this line, therefore, acts according to his nature, and the subjects of all the weak lines below are cared for as is best lor them. HEX. 5 . APPENDIX IT. 273 for the sky forms Hsu. The superior man, in accordance with this, eats and drinks, feasts and enjoys himself (as if there were nothing else to employ him). 1. ‘He is waiting in the (distant) border:’—-he makes no movement to encounter rashly the diffi culties (of the situation). ‘ It will be advantageous for him constantly to maintain (the purpose thus shown), in which case there will be no error: ’—he will not fail to pursue that regular course. 2. ‘ He is waiting on the sand: ’—he occupies his position in the centre with a generous forbearance. Though 1 he suffer the small injury of being spoken (against),’ he will bring things to a good issue. 3. ‘ He is waiting in the mud: ’—calamity is (close at hand, and as it were) in the outer (trigram). ‘He himself invites the approach of injuryif he be reverent and careful, he will not be worsted. 4. ‘He is waiting in (the place of) blood:’—he accommodates himself (to the circumstances of the time), and hearkens to (its requirements). 5. ‘ The appliances of a feast, and the good for tune through being firm and correct,’ are indicated by (the position in) the central and correct place. 6. ‘Guests come unurged (to give their help), and if (the subject of the line) receive them respectfully, there will be good fortune in the end: though the occupant and the place are not suited to each other, there has been no great failure (in what has been done). V. ‘ The cloud,’ it is said, ‘ that has risen to the top of the sky, has nothing more to do till it is called on, in the harmony of heaven THE APPENDIXES. HEX. ). APPENDIX II. VI. (The trigram representing) heaven and (that representing) water, moving away from each other, form Sung. The superior man, in accordance with this, in the transaction of affairs takes good counsel about his first steps. 1. 'He does not perpetuate the matter about which (the contention is): ’—contention should not be prolonged. Although ' he may suffer the small (injury) of being spoken against,’ his argument is clear. 2. ‘He is unequal to the contention; he retires and keeps concealed, stealthily withdrawing from it: ’—for him from his lower place to contend with (the stronger one) above, would be to (invite) cala mity, as if he brought it with his hand to himself. 3. ‘ He confines himself to the support assigned and earth, to discharge its store of rain.’ This gives to the writer the idea of waiting; and the superior man is supposed to be taught by this symbolism to enjoy his idle time, while he is waiting for the approach of danger and occasion for action. ‘ The regular course ’ of the subject of line 1 seems to be the determination to wait, at a distance from danger, the proper time to act. The subject of line 2, which is undivided and in the centre, is thereby shown to be possessed of a large and generous for bearance. The recognition of the circumstances of the time, and hearken ing to its requirements, explain, in paragraph 4, ‘ the retreat from the cavern,’ which is not here repeated from the Text. The line being weak and divided, its subject knows his own incompetency, and takes this prudent step. Kt says that he does not understand what is said under line 6 ,— that the occupant and the place are not suited to each other, for the yin line being in the .sixth, an even place, seems to be where it ought to be. We are only surprised that cases of inconsistency in these explanations are not more numerous, to him of old: ’—(thus) following those above him, he will have good fortune. 4. 1 He returns to (the study of Heaven’s) ordi nances, changes (his wish to contend), and rests in being firm and correct: ’—he does not fail (in doing what is right). 5. 'He contendsand with great fortune:’— this is shown by his holding the due mean and being in the correct place. 6. ‘ He receives the robe through his conten tion : ’—but still he is not deserving of respect. VII. (The trigram representing) the earth and in the midst of it that representing water, form Sze. The superior man, in accordance with this, nourishes and educates the people, and collects (from among them) the multitudes (of the hosts). 1. ‘The host goes forth according to the rules (for) such a movement: ’—if those rules be not ob served, there will be evil. VI, The symbolism here is different from that in the Text of the Thwan. We have the visible sky ascending and water or rain descending, which indicate, one hardly sees how, opposidon and contention, The lesson as to the course of the superior man is a good one, but might with equal propriety be deduced from many other hexagrams. Hsiang An-shih (Sung dynasty) says that the first part of para graph 2 is all to be taken as the language of the duke of Jau, the characters being varied j the rest is the remark of the writer of this treatise. It is observed that the returning to (the study of Heaven s) ordi nances, and changing the wish to contend, in paragraph 4, are not two things, but only one; ‘the ordinances (ming) meaning what is right in principle.’ The wish to contend was wrong in principle, and is now abandoned. 1 The robe ’ takes the place of ‘the leathern sash in paragraph 6; but the sash was merely an appendage of the robe. THE APPENDIXES. 2. ‘ He is in the midst of the host, and there will be good fortune: ’—he has received the favour of Heaven. ‘The king has thrice conveyed to him the orders (of) his favour: ’—(the king) cherishes the myriad regions in his heart. 3. ‘The host with the possibility of its having many idle leaders:’—great will be its want of success. 4. ‘The host is in retreat; but there is no error:’ —there has been no failure in the regular course. 5. ‘ The oldest son leads the host: ’—its move ments are directed by him in accordance with his position in the centre. ‘ Younger men idly occupy their positions: ’—the employment of -such men is improper. 6. ‘The great ruler delivers his charges:’— thereby he rightly apportions merit. ‘ Small men should not be employed: ’—they are sure to throw the states into confusion. VII. The Great Symbolism' here is not more satisfactory than in other paragraphs of it which have already come before us. KtH Hsi says‘ As the water is not outside the earth, so soldiers are not outside the people. Therefore if (a ruler) be able to nourish the people, he can get the multitudes (of his hosts).’ Is the meaning this,—that originally the people and soldiers are one body; that a portion of the people are taken out from among the mass, as occasion requires, to do the duty of soldiers; and that the nourish ment and education of the people is the best way to have good soldiers ready for use on any emergency? Compare the saying of Confucius in Analects XIII, xxx. What is said on the second line, that the general ‘ has received the favour of Heaven,' refers of course to the entire confidence reposed m him by the ruler or king, the subject of line 5. In this way. hien here is equal to Thien wang, so frequent in the bpring and Autumn,' and meaning—' King by the grace of HEX. 8. APPENDIX II. 2 77 VIII. (The trigram representing) the earth, and over it (that representing) water, form Pi. The ancient kings, in accordance with this, established the various states and maintained an affectionate relation to their princes. 1. From ‘the seeking union with its object’ shown in the first line, divided, there will be other advantages. 2. ‘ The movement towards union and attachment proceeds from the inward (mind): ’—(the party con cerned) does not fail in what is proper to himself. 3. 1 Union is sought with such as ought not to be associated withbut will not injury be the result? 4. ‘ Union is sought (by the party intended here) with one beyond himself, and (in this case) with a worthy object: ’—he is following (the ruler) above him. 5. ‘ The good fortune belonging to the most illus trious instance of seeking union and attachment appears in the correct and central position (of the fifth line, undivided). (The king’s) neglecting (the animals) confronting him (and then fleeing), and (only) taking those who present themselves as it were obediently, is seen in Heaven.' But the great powers given to the general are from the king’s wish through him to promote the good of all the nation.. In military operations there must be one ruling will and mind. A divided authority is sure to be a failure. But ‘ a retreat is no evidence of failure in a campaign. When advance would lead to disaster, retreat is the regular course to pursue. Other ways can be found to reward small men. They ought not to be placed in situations where the condition of others will depend on them, THE APPENDIXES. SECT. !. ‘ his allowing the escape of those in front of him/ ‘ That the people of his towns do not warn one another (to prevent such escape),’ shows how he, in his high eminence, has made them pursue the due course. 6 . ‘ He seeks union and attachment without taking the first (step to such an end): ’—there is no possi bility of a (good) issue. IX. (The trigram representing) the sky, and that representing wind moving above it, form HsHo Kkt The superior man, in accordance with this, adorns the outward manifestation of his virtue. 1. ‘ He returns and pursues his own path: ’—it is right that there should be good fortune. 2. ‘By the attraction (of the subject of the former line) he returns (to its own course),’ and is in the central placeneither will he err in what is due from him. 3. ‘ Husband and wife look on each other with averted eyes:’—(the subject of line three is like a VIII. ‘ Water upon the face of the earth ’ is supposed to be an emblem of close union. Of the mere fact of close union this may be accepted as a fair illustration, and of its completeness, Some other symbolism might set forth better the tendency of parties to union, and their seeking it. What is said about the ancient kings is more pertinent to the meaning of the hexagram than in many other applications in ‘ the Great Symbolism.’ The king appears in it not only as the centre, but as the cause, of union. ‘The other advantages' under line 1 refer to all the benefits that will result from sincerity and union, which are in themselves good. It is hardly possible to make what is said under line 5, on the royal huntings, agree with the account of them given on the same Ime m the duke of Ziu’s text. I suspect that there is some corruption of the text. The two verbs ‘neglecting' and ‘taking’ seem to be used, the one for the other. HEX. 9. APPENDIX II. husband who) cannot maintain correctly his relations with his wife. 4. ( He is possessed of sincerity; his (ground for) apprehension is dismissed:’—(the subjects of the lines) above agree in aim with him. 5. ‘ He is possessed of sincerity, and draws others to unite with him : ’—he does not use only his own rich resources. 6. ‘ The rain has fallen and (the onward progress) is stayed: ’—the power (denoted in the figure) has accumulated to the full. ‘ If the superior man prose cute his measures, there will be evil:’—he will find himself obstructed. IX. The suitability of the symbolism here is made all to turn on the wind. ‘ Wind,’ says Zu, 1 is simply the air, without solid sub stance ; it can restrain, but not for long.’ The wind moves in the sky for a time, and then ceases. The process of thought from the symbol to the lesson is not easily traced. Is it meant to say that virtue manifesting itself outwardly—-in the carriage and speech—is, however good, but a small matter, admirable in an officer, or even a feudal lord, but that we look for more in a king, the Head of a nation? KJ& ng-^ze calls attention to the addition to the duke ol Zau’s explanation in the notice on line 2, that ‘ it is in the central place, adding that this explains how the subject of the line restrains him self, and does not go beyond what is due from him. Only half of the symbolism in the Text of line 3 is taken up here. Line 1, it is said, is far from line 4, the mauvais sujet of the hexagram, and little affected by it; line 2 is nearer, but,being in the centre, suffers little; line 3 is close on it, and, not being in the centre, comes under its evil influence; while line 6 gives no hep. Line 4 is weak, and in an even place, appropriate to it; and hence its subject is said to ‘ have sincerity.' Being the first line, moreover, of Sun, the two others take their character from it, Line 5, being undivided, and occupying the most important place in the figure, according to the value usually attached to the lines, is i 280 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. I. X. (The trigram representing) the sky above, and below it (that representing the waters of) a marsh, form Li. The superior man, in accordance with this, discriminates between high and low, and gives settlement to the aims of the people. 1. ‘He treads his accustomed path and goes for ward : ’—singly and exclusively he carries out his (long-cherished) wishes. 2. ‘ A quiet and solitary man, to whom, being firm and correct, there will be good fortune: ’—holding the due mean, he will not allow himself to be thrown into disorder. 3. ‘A one-eyed man (who thinks that he) can see:’—he is not fit to see clearly. ‘A lame man (who thinks that he can) tread well: ’—one cannot walk along with him. * The ill fortune of being bitten’ arises from the place not being the proper one for him. ‘ A (mere) bravo acting the part of a great ruler: —this is owing to his aims being (too) violent. 4. 1 He becomes full of apprehensive caution, and in the end there will be good fortune:’—his aim takes effect. 5* 'He treads resolutely; and though he be firm and correct, there is peril: ’—this is due to his being in the position that is correct and appropriate to him. said ‘ to be rich,’ or ‘ to have rich resources.’ With these he unites with the 1 subjects ’ of line 4 to effect their common object. Under line 6 we are told that the restraint is at its height, and the restrained should keep still for a time. The paragraph is metrical. The paragraphs to lines 1,2, 3, all rhyme together. So do those to 4,5; and now under 6, we have a couplet:— 1 Lo! rain, lo! rest, the power is full 1 Good man! hold hard, Obstructions rule/ HEX. II.

(The trigrams for) heaven and earth in com munication together form TMi, The (sage) sove reign, in harmony with this, fashions and completes (his regulations) after the courses of heaven and earth, and assists the application of the adaptations furnished by them,—in order to benefit the people. 1. ‘The good fortune of advance, (as suggested by the emblem of) the grass pulled up,’ arises from the will (of the party intended) being set on what is external to himself. 2. ‘He bears with the uncultivated, and proves himself acting in accordance with the due mean: ’— for (his intelligence is) bright and (his capacity is) great. 3. ‘ There is no going away so that there shall not be a return’ refers to this as the point where the interaction of heaven and earth takes place. 4. ‘He comes fluttering (down), not relying on X. 1 The sky above and a marsh lying below it is true,’ says .ffMng-flze, ‘ in nature and reason; and so should be the rules of propriety on which men tread.’ This symbolism is far-fetched; and so is the application of it, if in any way drawn from it. But it is true that the members of a community or nation must keep their several places and duties in order to its being in a state of good order. For lines 1,2, 3, and 4, see notes on the Text. If we might translate the conclusion of what is said on line 5, by—‘in the position that is correctly appropriate to him, the meaning would be more clear, though still the assumption which I have pointed out on the Text would underlie the statement; and as evidently as there, what is said under line 6 is but a truism.

XII. (The trigrams of) heaven and earth, not in intercommunication, form Phi, The superior man, in accordance with this, restrains (the manifestation of) his virtue, and avoids the calamities (that threaten him). There is no opportunity of conferring on him the glory of emolument. XI. It is difficult to translate the application of ' the Great Sym bolism' here, so that it shall be intelligible to a reader. A 7 /ang-jze says:—‘A ruler should frame his laws and regulations so that the people may avail themselves of the seasons of heaven, and of the advantages afforded by the earth, assisting their transforming and nourishing services, and completing their abundant and admirable benefits. Thus the breath of spring, calling forth all vegetable life, gives the law for sowing and planting; the breath of autumn, completing and solidifying all things, gives the law for ingathering and storing,’ ' \" The subject of line 1 has 1 his will on what is external to him self : —he is bent on going forward. ■Kt Hsf explains what is said on paragraph 4, that the upper lines , 1 are out of their real place where they are,' or, literally, ‘ have lost their substantiality,’ by the remark that«their proper place, as being weak lines, is below.’ The editors of the imperial edition prefer another explanation, on which I need not enter. HEX. 12. APPENDIX II. 1. ‘The good fortune through firm goodness, (suggested by) the pulling up of the grass,’ arises from the will (of the parties intended) being bent on (serving) the ruler. 2. ‘ The great man, comporting himself as the distress and obstruction require, will have success:’— he does not allow himself to be disordered by the herd (of small men). 3. That ‘his shame is folded in his breast’ is owing to the inappropriateness of his position. 4. ‘ He acts in accordance with the ordination (of Heaven), and commits no error;’—the purpose of his mind can be carried into effect. 5. ‘The good fortune of the great man’ arises from the correctness of his position. 6. ‘ The distress and obstruction having reached its end, it is overthrown and removed—how could it be prolonged ? XII. ‘ The Great Symbolism’ here is sufficiently explained in the first Appendix. The application, however, is here again difficult, though we may try to find in it a particular instance of the inter ruption of communication,—in great merit not meeting with its reward. The subject of the first line is one of the cluster of small men who are able to change their mind, and set their hearts to love their ruler. The subject of the second line is a ‘ great man,’ and occupies the place in the centre. The subject of the third line is weak, and does not occupy his correct position;—hence the symbolism. The fourth line is near the fifth, the ruler’s place. It is a strong line in an even place; but acting according to the will of Heaven or of the ruler, its subject gets his purpose carried out. The subject of the fifth line is the great man, the ruler in his right place. Hence he is successful, and in the last line, we see THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX II. XIII. (The trigrams for) heaven and fire form Thung Zan, The superior man, in accordance with this), distinguishes things according to their kinds and classes. 1. ‘ (The representative of) the union of men is just issuing from his gate: ’—who will blame him? 2. ‘(The representative of) the union of men appears in relation with his kindred: ’—that is the path to regret. 3. ‘He hides his arms in the thick grass:’— because of the strength of his opponent 1 For three years he makes no demonstration: ’—how can he do anything ? 4. ‘ He is mounted on his city-wall;' but yielding to the right, ‘lie does not proceed to make the attack (he contemplated).’ (Where it is said), ‘.There will be good fortune,’ (that shows how) he feels the strait he is in, and returns to the rule of law. 5. The first action of (the representative of) the union of men (here described) arises from his central position and straightforward character. ‘ The meet ing secured by his great host’ intimates that the opponents of it have been overcome. 6. ‘(The representative of) the union of men appears in the suburbs: ’—his object has not yet been attained. how the distress and obstruction are come to an end. It was in the order of change that they should do so. XIII. The style of‘heaven and fire form Thung Xan’ is such as to suggest the appearance of fire ascending up, blazing to the sky, and uniting with it. The application of the symbolism is again perplexing.

Beyond the suburbs was the open country, and till the union reached so far, the object of the hexagram was not attained. We may truly say that Confucius was a skilful reader of the duke of jST&u?

The superior man, looking at this symbolism, diminishes the multitude of human desires within him, and increases the single shoot of heavenly principle; so does he become grandly just, and can deal with all things evenly according to the nature of each. In whatever circumstances or place he is, he will do what is right,’ This is certainly very ingenious, but one shrinks from accepting a view that is not based on the component trigrams. Under line x, ‘ nourishes his (virtue)’ is,literally, ‘pastures him self.’ He is all humility. That makes him what he is. Under line 4, ‘ the (proper) rule’ is the rule proper for the subject of the line in his circumstances so near the place of the ruler. Under line 5, ‘ the refusal to submit makes an appeal to force necessary. Even the best and humblest ruler bears the sword, and must not bear it in vain. , I'd Hsi bases all that is said under line 6 on its being a weak line; so that the humble ruler is unable even at the close of the action described in the figure to accomplish all his objects, and must limit his field even in appealing to arms.

The use of music at sacrifices, however, as assisting the union produced by those services between God and his wor shippers, and the present and past generations, agrees with the general idea of the figure. I must suppose that the writer had in mind the sacrifices instituted by the duke of Wau, as related in the Hsifio King, chap. ix. Pleasure has operated injuriously on the subject of line 1. He calls attention to himself. Only a part of the symbolism of line 2 is referred to here. Such an omission is not uncommonas in lines 3 and 4 also.

XVII, An explosion of thunder amidst the waters of a marsh would be succeeded by a tremulous agitation of those waters; so far there would be a following of the movement of the lower tri gram by the upper. Then in the application of the symbolism we have an illustration of action following the time, that is, according to the time; which is a common use of the Chinese character Sui. Neither the symbolism, however, nor its application adds much to our understanding of the text, Paragraph 1 consists of two lines that rhyme; and paragraphs 4 (two lines), 5, and 6 do the same. According to Kh Yen-wu, paragraphs 2 and 3 also rhyme; but this appears to me doubtful. The symbolism of these paragraphs is sufficiently explained in the notes on the Text.

XIX, ‘The earth descending or approaching the marsh' is, according to Affi H$f, symbolical of the approach of superiors to the inferior people, and then the two predicates about the superior man are descriptive of him in that approach, the instruction being symbolised by Tui, and the supporting by Kh w an. The Shang hai editors, wishing to defend the explanation of lin by ‘great/ in Appendix VI, which they ascribe to Confucius, say:—‘Lin means “great.” The earth above the waters of the marsh shows how full those waters are, rising to the level of the earth, and thus expressing the idea of greatness.' This representation is lame and impotent. ATh Hsi says he does not understand what is said on line 2. The interpretation in my version is the ordinary one, but I am not satisfied with it. The Khang-hst editors try to solve the difficulty; but I am not able to follow them. The same editors compare the conclusion of paragraph 6 in the symbolism of hexagram n, ‘ What is external 1 there, and 1 what is interna] here, have, they say, the same reference,—the state, namely, of the whole kingdom, the expressions differing according to the different standpoints from which they are made.

Wind moving above the earth has the widest sweep, and nothing escapes its influence; it penetrates everywhere.

XXII. ' A mountain,' says Khl ng-jze, 1 2 is a place where we find grass, trees, and a hundred other things. A fire burning below it throws up its light, and brings them all out in beauty ; and this gives the idea of ornament, or being ornamented. The various processes of government are small matters, and elegance and orna ment help their course; but great matters of judgment demand the simple, unornamented truth.’ The subject of line 1 does not care for and does not need orna ment. He will walk in the way of righteousness without it. Paragraph 3 tells us that it is not ornament, but correct firmness, which secures the respect of others. In the fourth place, and cut off from line x by 2 and 3, we might doubt how far the subject of 4 would continue loyal to the subject of 1.

Notwithstanding ‘the perilous position of him other hand, Lift Mft (early in the Sung dynasty) saysA moun tain has the earth for its foundation. If the earth be thick, the mountain preserves its height. So it is with the sovereign and people.’ The application might be deduced from either view. It is hard to tell whether ‘the lowest' in paragraph 1 should be supplemented as I have done. If not, then the explanation is a mere truism, A^ang-jze is precise and decisive in supplementing the explana tion of paragraph 2 as in the translation. See on the Text of lines 3 and 4. On paragraph 5, the Khang-hs! editors say admirably‘ The fifth line is weak, and yet occupies the most honourable place in the figure,—emblematic of a queen; and as its subject leads on the subjects of the other lines to obtain the favours given to the inmates of the palace, she, it is plain, has neither jealousy nor any other injurious temper that might incur blame for tending to overthrow the ruler.' Paragraph 6 shows the ruler restored to the favour of the people, and the restoration of concord in the state.

XXIV. ‘Thunder in the midst of the earth’ is thunder shut up and silent, just able to make its presence felt. So is it with the first genial stirrings of life after the winter solstice; so is it with the first returning steps of the wanderer to virtue. As the spring of life has to be nursed in quietness, so also has the purpose of good, The ancient statutes here referred to must have been like the present cessation from public and private business at the time of the new year, when all the Chinese people are for a time dissolved in festivity and joy. Canon McClatchie translates here‘ The ancient kings on this culminating day (i. e. the seventh) closed their gates,’ &c. ‘ Cul minating day' does not give us the meaning so well as 1 the day of the solstice; but where does the translator find the explanatory the seventh/ which he puts in parentheses ? In my own ‘ salad’ days of Chinese knowledge I fancied there might be in paragraph 1 of the Text some allusion to a primitive sabbath; but there is no ground for introducing ‘ seven days,’ or ‘ the seventh day/ into this paragraph of the Great Symbolism. ‘ The v ‘rtuous subject of the first line’ is in paragraph 2 called siin, the benevolent or ‘loving/ It is the only case in all the symbolism of the Yt where we find that term used as an adjective.

The thunder rolls all under the sky, and to (every)thing there is given (its nature), free from all insincerity.

The composition of the hexagram is given here in a manner different from what we have met with in the account of any of the preceding figures; and as the text is not called in ques tion, I have made the best I could in the translation of the two commencing clauses. The application of the symbolism to what the ancient kings did is also hard to comprehend. The paragraph on line 1 is another way of saying that in the course of things real goodness may be expected to be fortunate,- ‘ by the appointment of Heaven.’ Paragraph 2. 1 The thought of getting rich had not risen in his mind: —he did what he did, because it was right, not because of the gain it would bring him. .......

This symbolism agrees sufficiently well with the idea of influence passing between a superior and inferior party in relation with each other. There is nothing in the representation, however, to suggest particularly the relation between husband and wife; and the more I think of it, the more doubtful it becomes to me that king Wan intended by the trigrams of this figure to give the idea of man and wife. The application of the symbolism is sufficiently appropriate. The commentators see in it especially the lesson of humility- emptiness of self, or poverty of spirit—in order that the influences to which we are subjected may have free course. Paragraph 1. What is beyond one’s self is represented by line 4, a proper correlate of 1, There is the desire to influence; but it is ineffectively exhibited, _ Paragraph 2. ‘Compliance (with the circumstances of his con dition and place)’ is merely another way of ‘being Arm and correct.’ Paragraph 3. The language, ‘ What he holds in his grasp is low,’ makes Jfu Hsi and the older commentators generally understand low of lines r and 2, and their weak subjects. But ‘ following ’ leads the mind to the lines above, as the Khang-hst editors point out. ‘Low’ is to be understood in the sense of ‘ mean.’ Paragraph 4, The ‘being firm and correct’ appears here as equivalent to the want of ‘ a selfish wish to influence.’ Paragraph 5, The triviality of the aim explains the ineffective ness of the movement, but not its giving no occasion for repent ance. That the mei which are moved are behind and above the region of the heart seems too mechanical and trivial an explanation. hex. 32. APPENDIX II. XXXII.

There is ‘the perilousness of the position shown by the retiring tail: —but if * no movement’ be made, what disaster can there be ? 2. 1 He holds it as by (a thong from the hide of) a yellow ox; ’—his purpose is firm. 3. ‘The peril connected with the case of one retiring, though bound,’ is due to the (consequent) distress and exhaustion, ‘ If he were (to deal as in) nourishing a servant or concubine, it would be fortunate for him: ’—but a great affair cannot be dealt with in this way. 4. ‘A superior man retires notwithstanding his likings; a small man cannot attain to this,' 5. ‘He retires in an admirable way, and with firm correctness there will be good fortune; ’—this is due to the rectitude of his purpose. 6. ‘ He retires in a noble way, and his doing so will be advantageous in every respect: V-he who does so has no doubts about his course. From paragraph 5 it appears that what is right will vary in different cases. The lesson of the hexagram is perseverance in what is right in each particular case, XXXIII. Kfl Hsi says:—‘ The sky is illimitable ; a mountain is high, but has its limits; the union of these is an emblem of re tiring.’ I do not understand such embleming. IVrling-^e says * Below the sky is a mountain. The mountain rises up below the sky, and its height is arrested, while the sky goes up higher and higher, till they come to be apart from each other. In this we have an emblem of retiring and avoiding.’ We fed somewhat as HEX. 34. APPENDIX II. XXXIV.

The symbolism of the various lines is sufficiently explained on the Text. Paragraph 5 is but a repetition of the Text without additional explanation. XXXIV. In illustration of the symbolism of the trigrams here, Khh\\%-m says well Thunder rolling above in the #ky and making all things shake is the emblem of great power.’ In passing on to its application he starts with a beautiful saying of antiquity, that ‘the strong man is he who overcomes himself. That this thought was in the mind of the writer of the paragraph on the Great Symbolism I can well believe; but the analogy be ween the natural and the moral and spiritual worlds in passing from th phenomenon of thunder to this truth is a thing to be felt, and that can hardly be described. THE APPENDIXES. XXXV. (The trigram representing) the earth and that for the bright (sun) coming forth above it form 3 in. The superior man, according to this, gives himself to make more brilliant his bright virtue. 1. ‘He appears wishing to advance, but (at the same time) being kept back: ’-all-alone he pursues the correct course. ‘ Let him maintain a large and generous mind, and there will be no error:’—he has not yet received an official charge. 2. ‘He will receive this great blessing:’—for he is in the central place and the correct position for him. 3. ‘ All (around) trust him: ’—their (common) aim is to move upwards and act. 4. ‘ (He advances like) a marmot. However firm and correct he may be, his position is one of peril: ’—his place is not that appropriate for him. 5. ■ Let him not concern himself whether he fails or succeeds: ’—his movement in advance will afford ground for congratulation. 6. ‘ He uses his horns only to punish (the rebel lious people of) his city:’—his course of procedure is not yet brilliant. Paiagiaph 1. ‘This will lead to exhaustion;' and from that will follow distress and other evils. The central position and the due moral mean in paragraph 2 is another instance of the felt analogy referred to above. In paragraph 3 nothing is added to the Text ; and on the symbolism nothing is said. , ^ ara ® ra P^ is ■ not in his appropriate place: ’ this is said simply because an odd place ought to be filled by a strong line.

With the aim represented by ‘ hunting in the south ’ a great achievement is accomplished. 4. ‘ He has (just) entered into the left side of the belly (of the dark land): —he is still able to carry out the idea in his (inner) mind. 5. ‘ With the firm correctness of the count of K\\, his brightness could not be (quite) extinguished. 6. ‘He had at first ascended to (the top of) the sky: ’—he might have enlightened the four quarters the application of this symbolism, Hu Ping-wan (Yiian dynasty) says J Of strong things there is none so strong as heaven; and hence the superior man after its pattern makes himself strong; of bright things there is none so bright as the sun, and after its pattern he makes himself bright.’ If the subject of line 1 had received an official charge, then when unrecognised by his sovereign, and obstructed in his progress, his correct course would have been to cease to advance, and retire from the office in which he was not allowed to carry out his principles. . , . . There is nothing said on line 2 to explain particularly the sym bolism of ‘ the grandmother’ in the Text. ‘The course of procedure’ in paragraph 6 has still an element of force in it, which is more to 'the far correctness that was to king W 5 n the ideal character of a feudal lord, and therefore his light is not yet that of the full-orbed sun.

XXXVII. The Symbolism here is certainly far-fetched. ‘As wind,’ it is said, ‘ comes first from fire, so does transforming influ ence emanate from the family.' But the subject of the hexagram is the regulation and not the influence of the family. Then the application is good for the superior man’s cultivation of himself ; but this again is only connected indirectly with the regulation of the family. The sooner preventive measures are presented to the youthful mind the better; but does not prohibition imply that a change in the good will has taken place ? In paragraph 2 1 docility' is suggested by the weak line. The humility ’ conies out of Sun, the upper trigram, whose attribute is pliant flexibility. Yii Yen (Yflan dynasty) ingeniously observes on paragraph 4 that the riches of a family are not to be sought in its wealth, but in the affection and harmony of its members. Where these pre vail, the family is not likely to be poor, and whatever it has will be well preserved. The mention ‘of mutual love’ is unusual in Chinese writings, and must he considered remarkable here. ‘The husband, says jT/iang-tze, ‘ loves his helpmate in the house; the wife loves him ,,ho is the pattern for the family.’ But bower admtrable the sentiment is, it comes from the mind of the ivnter, and is not drawn from the Text. , , .

The strong (fourth) line and the weak line here are in correlationwe judge rightly in saying that ‘ its subject will commit no error.’ 2. ‘The good fortune springing from the firm correctness of the second line, undivided/ is due to its subject holding the due mean. 3. For ‘a porter with his burden to be riding in a carriage’ is a thing to be ashamed of. ‘ It is he himself that tempts the robbers to come:’—on whom besides can we lay the blame ?

It is said, ‘ Though the difficulties be too great for him to overcome, the sage accepts his desire, in order to stimulate others to loyal devotedness,’ On paragraph 3, Khung Ying-td says:— 1 Of the three lines of the lower trigram only the third is yang, above the two others which are of the yin nature. They cling to it, and are repre sented as if rejoicing in it. The view given of paragraph 4 is that of the Khang-hst editors. The friends in paragraph 5 are the subjects of the second line, the correlate of 5, and also of the two other lines of the lower trigram. .

XL, It is a common saying that thunder and rain clear the atmosphere, and a feeling of oppression is relieved. Ihe last paragraph of Appendix I, however, leads us to understand the Symbolism of the phenomena of spring. I he application seems to refer to the gentle policy of a conqueror forward to forgive the opposition of those who offer no more resistance. The subject of line 2 is a minister or officer; and the Khang-hst editors say that while straightforwardness, symbolised by the ariow, is the first duty of an officer, if he do not temper that quality by pursuing the due medium, which is symbolised by the yellow colour of the arrow, but proceed by main force, and that only, to remove what is evil, he will provoke indignation and rebellion. The ■' three foxes 1 are not alluded to in this second paragiaph. On paragraph 4 the same editors say:—‘The subject of this line is not in the central nor in an odd place; he has for his correlate the subject of line 1 and for his close associate that of line 3, both of which lines are weak in strong places.^ Hence it is said, that they are all in places inappropriate to them. What paragraph 5 says, that ‘the small men retire, means that believing in the sincerity of the ruler's determination to remove a evil men, they retire of themselves, or strive to conform to his wishes. THE APPENDIXES. 2. 1 It will be advantageous for (the subject of) the second line, undivided, to maintain his firm correctness: ’—his central position gives its character to his aim. 3. ‘ One man, walking,’ (finds his friend)when three are together, doubts rise among them. 4. ‘He diminishes the ailment under which he labours: ’—this is matter for joy. 5. ‘ The great good fortune attached to the fifth line, divided,’ is due to the blessing from above. 6. ‘He gives increase to others without taking from what is his own: ’—he obtains his wish on a grand scale. XLI. 1 The waters of a marsh are continually rising up in vapour to bedew the hill above it, and thus increase its verdure; what is taken from the marsh gives increase to the hill/ This is very far-fetched. In the application again the superior man acts only on himself, and for himself 5—which has nothing to do with those of low degree giving to those above them, This application, how ever, agrees with what, as we have seen on the Text, was KB ng- p's view of the meaning of the hexagram. The explanation appended to paragraph 1 seems to be to account for the subject of line 1 hurrying away to the help of line 4. ‘ His aim’ is to abide where he is, and help the subject of 5 by the exhibition of ‘ firm correctness/ The Khang-hst editors observe that paragraph 3 is true indeed of three men; and not of three men only, but of many repetitions of thought or action. 1 he same editors say on paragraph 5 that ' the blessing from above is explained, by many, of the oracles obtained through divining with the tortoise-shell; but that looking at the text on line 2 of the next hexagram, and that Ti (spoken of there) is the lord of all spirits, the term “above\" here is most naturally explained of Heaven s mind, whose acceptance cannot be gainsaid by men or spirits/ Z/iSng-jze says on paragraph 6, though I do not see the rele- HEX. 42.

The superior man, in accordance with this, bestows emolument on those below him, and dislikes allowing his gifts to accumulate (undls- pensed). 1. ‘Without (being able to) succeed, he goes forward: ’—this is an error. 2. ‘Though hostile measures be taken against him, he need not be anxious;’—he pursues the course of the due mean. 3. ‘The superior man looks bent on cutting off the culprit:’—there will in the end be no error. 4. ‘ He walks slowly and with difficulty: ’—he is not in the place appropriate to him. ‘He hears these words, but does not believe them: ’—he hears, but does not understand. 5. 1 If his action be in harmony with his central it more commonly does, wind. Thunder and wind, it is sup posed, increase each the other; and their combination gives the idea of increase- Then the application, good in itself, must be treated very nicely, as it is by the Khang-hsi editors, in order to make out any connexion between it and the Symbolism. Paragraph 1, ‘ One in a low position should not move in great affairs; —not a son, it is said, while his father is alive; nor a min* istei, while his ruler governs; nor a member of an official depart ment, while its head directs its affairs. If such a one do initiate such an affair, only great success will excuse his rashness. Paragiaph 2. Line 5 is the proper correlate of 2; and its subject will be among the contributing parties.

We can only understand the mounting of the waters of a marsh up into the sky of the phenomenon of evaporation; and certainly the waters so formed into clouds will be condensed, and come down again as rain, This may be taken as an image of dispersion, but not of displacement in the sense of the Text of the hexagram. The first clause of the application follows naturally enough from the above interpretation of the Symbolism, Wfi LIsi says he does not understand the second clause. Many critics adopt the view of it which appears in the translation. Paragraph 2 does not mention the precautionary measures taken in the Text by the subject of the line, from which the conclusion would follow quite as naturally as from his central position. The Khang-hsi editors, however, say that the not having recourse lightly to force is itself the due course. Line 3 responding, and alone of all the strong lines responding to 6, may appear at first irresolute, and not prepared for decided measures; but ‘in the end' its subject does what is required of him. The contiguity of line g to the divided 6, is supposed to have some bad effect on its subject, so that while he does what his central position requires, it is not without an effort ‘If a man,’ says jOang-jze, ‘cherish a single illicit desire in his mind, he has left the right way.

My supplement,' This describes the arrest of/ k a conclusion from the whole of the Text on the line. All the com mentaries have it. In the ‘ Daily Lecture’ it is said that the lesson of paragraph 3 is that 1 the subject of the line should make the repression of 1 his own exclusive work, and not allow it to pass on to the subject of any of the other lines.’ That view is rather different from the one indicated in my supplement. ‘ His steps have not been drawn into the course of the first HEX. 4 g.

See what is said on the Text. But that the subject of the line stands alone is owing, it is here implied, to his own impatience. If he could exercise forbearance, he would find a proper opportunity to check the advance of the subject of line 1. The subject of line g, while mindful of his task in the hexagiam, to repress the advance symbolised by 1,—yet keeps his wise plans concealed till the period of carrying them into execution, deter mined by the ordinances of Heaven, has arrived, Then comes the successful stroke of his policy as if it were directly from Heaven. The subject of line 6 really accomplishes nothing to repress the advance of the unworthy; but he keeps himself from evil commu nication with them. He is not to be charged with blameable error, though more and better might have been expected of him. THE APPENDIXES.

The superior man, in accord ance with this, pays careful attention to his virtue, and accumulates the small developments of it till it is high and great. 1. ‘He is welcomed in his advance upwards, and there will be great good fortune:’—(the subjects of) the upper (trigram) are of the same mind with him. 2. ‘The sincerity of the subject of the second line, undivided, 1 affords occasion for joy. 3. ‘He advances upwards (as into) an empty city: ’—he has no doubt or hesitation. 4. ‘ The king employs him to prevent his offerings on mount Khi : ’—such a service (of spiritual Beings) is according to (their mind). XLV. What has this Great Symbolism to do with the idea and preservation of union? The question is answered in this way:— A marsh whose waters are high up above the earth must be kept in by banks and dykes, to keep them together, to preserve them from being dispersed, So the union of a people must be preserved by precautions against what would disturb and destroy it. Of such pre cautions the chief is to be prepared to resist attack from without, and to put down internal sedition. Paragraph 3. The topmost line is the last in Tui, whose attri bute is complacent satisfaction, appearing in flexibility or docility. Paragraph g. ‘ His mind and aim have not yet been brilliantly displayed:—this is in explanation of the case that some may even still not have confidence in him. Paragraph 6. The topmost position is that of the trigram; the subject of the line might bid farewell to all the work of the hexa gram ; but he cannot bear to do so. HEX. 47 , 5. ‘ He is firmly correct, and will therefore enjoy good fortune.

XLVII. (The trigram representing) a marsh, and (below it that for a defile, which has drained the other dry so that there is) no water in it, form Khwan. The superior man, in accordance with this, will sacrifice his life in order to carry out his purpose. 1, ‘He enters a dark valley:’—so benighted is he, and without clear vision. 2. ‘He is straitened amidst his wine and viands: ’—(but) his position is central, and there will be ground for congratulation. XLVI. See what has been said on the Great Symbolism in Appendix I. The application which is made of it here may be accepted, though it has nothing to do with the teaching of the Text about the gradual rise of a good officer to high social distinc tion and influence. Paragraph 1. Instead of finding in this the three lines of Khwan and their subjects, AHng-jze makes ‘the upper' denote only line 2. Paragraph 2. The subject of line 2 in his loyal devotion to 5 will do much good and benefit many; hence we have the words, 1 affords occasion for joy.' Paragraph 3. ‘ He has no doubt or hesitation: ’-but this is pre suming rather on his strength. Paragraph 4. . The Khang-hsi editors say:—‘ Such an employ ment of men of worth to do service to spiritual Beings is serving them according to their mind.’ _ Paragraph 6. When one has reached the greatest height, he should think of retiring. Ambition otherwise may overleap itself. THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX II. 3. 'He lays hold of thorns:’—(this is suggested by the position of the line) above the strong (line). ‘ He enters his palace, and does not see his wife;’—this is inauspicious. 4. ' He proceeds very slowly (to help the subject of the first line): ’—his aim is directed to (help) that lower (line). Although he is not in his appropriate place, he and that other will (in the end) be together. 5. ‘ His nose and feet are cut offV—his aim has not yet been gained. ‘ He is leisurely, however, in his movements, and is satisfied: ’—his position is central and (his virtue) is correct. ‘ It will be well for him to be (as sincere as) in sacrificing: ’—so shall he receive blessing. 6. ' He is straitened as if bound with creepers:’— (his spirit and action) are unsuitable. ‘(He says), \"If I move, I shall repent of it.” And he does repent (of former errors), which leads to good fortune: ’—so he (now) goes on. XLVII. The first sentence of the Great Symbolism is constructed differently from any which has presented itself in the previous 46 hexagrams. Literally translated, it would be ‘a marsh with no water is Khwan;’ and this might certainly suggest to us a con dition of distress. But how does this come out of the trigrams? The upper one is Tui, representing a marsh; and the lower is Khan, representing water in a defile. The collocation of the two suggests the running of the water from the marsh or lake into the stream, which will soon empty the other. Such is the view which occurred to myself; and it is the same as that given by ATi Hst:—‘The water descending and leaking away, the marsh above will become dry,’ The application is good in itself, but the con catenation between it and the Symbolism is hardly discernible. HEX. 48. XLVIII. (The trigram representing) wood and above it that for water form 3 ing. The superior man, in accordance with this, comforts the people, and stimulates them to mutual helpfulness. 1.

A prayer is made ‘that the king were intelli gent : ’—for then blessing would be received. 4. ‘ A well the lining of which is well laid. There will be no error: ’—the well has been put in good repair. 5. ‘The waters from the cold spring are (freely) drunk: -this is indicated by the central and correct position (of the line). 6. ‘ The great good fortune ’ at the topmost place So stupid is the subject of line 1 that by his own act he increases his distress. The Khang-hst editors say that the ‘ground for congratulation in paragraph 2 is the banqueting and sacrificing.’ I rather think it is the measure of. help, which it is intimated the subject will give in removing the straitness and distress of the time. See the extract from the Khang-hst editors on the symbolism of the third line of the Text. The difficulties attending the symbolism of the Text of lines 4, 5, and 6 are not lightened by what we find in this Appendix. 3 s8 THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX II. indicates the grand accomplishment (of the idea in the hexagram). XLIX. (The trigram representing the waters of) a marsh and that for fire in the midst of them form Ko. The superior man, in accordance with this, regulates his (astronomical) calculations, and makes clear the seasons and times. 1. ‘He is bound with (the skin of) a yellow ox:’—he should in his circumstances be taking action. 2. ‘He makes his changes when some time has passed: ’—what he does will be matter of admira tion. 3. ‘The change (contemplated) .has been three times fully discussed: —to what else should atten tion (now) be directed ? 4. ‘The good fortune consequent on changing (existing) ordinances ’ is due to the faith reposed in his aims. 5. ‘The great man produces his changes as the tiger does when he changes his stripes:’—their beauty becomes more brilliant. XLVIII. The Great Symbolism here may well enough represent a well, it being understood that the water which is above the wood is that raised by it for irrigation and other uses. What is said, moreover, in the application is more akin to the idea of the hexa gram than in most of the other cases, It is certainly one way in which the ruler should nourish the people. It is said on paragraph 1‘ Those who have a mind to do something in the world, when they look at this line, and its sym bolism, will learn how they ought to exert themselves/ Rather in opposition to what I have said on the Text of line 4, the ‘ Daily Lecture ' observes here‘ The cultivation of one’s self, which is represented here, is fundamental to the government of others.’ HEX. 50. 6. ‘The superior man produces his changes as the leopard does when he changes his spots: ’—their beauty becomes more elegant. ‘Small men change their faces:’—they show themselves prepared to follow their ruler.

Wise men, occupying themselves with the determination of the seasons and questions of time, have in all ages based their judgments on the observation of the heavenly bodies. We find this insisted on in the first book of the Shfi, by the ancient Yao. But how this application of the Great Symbolism really flows from it, I must confess myself unable to discover. Once, however, when I was conversing about the Yi with a high Chinese dignitary, who was a well-read scholar also so far as his own literature was con cerned, he referred to this paragraph as proving that all our western science had been known to Fft-hsi and Confucius! _ What is said on the several lines is sufficiently illustrated in the notes on the Text.

L. The Great Symbolism here has come before us in the treatise on the Thwan. Of the application of that symbolism I can only say that, as has been seen in many other hexagrams, while good enough in itself, it is far-fetched, The same remark may be made on the explanation of the Text of the first line. I can myself do little more than guess at its meaning. The Khang-hs! editors observe that nothing is said about the case of the ‘concubine’ in the Text; but that it is covered by the ‘following the more noble,’ ‘so condensed and complete are the words of the sage!' The same editors find a pregnant sense in the conclusion of paragraph 2‘ There will be no fault in me to which my enemy can point, and his disposition to find fault will be diminished.’ ‘What was required of the caldron in the third line was that that line and line 5, instead of 6, should be correlates;' but there is little meaning in such a statement.

Nor does the application of it; but may it not be loo late to fear, and order anew one’s thoughts and actions when t ie retributions in providence are taking place?

According to the view of the Khang-hst editors, the application should be translated:—‘ The superior man, in accord ance with this, thinks anxiously how he shall not go beyond the duties of his position.’ It is difficult to decide between this shade of the meaning, and the more common one which I have followed. The toes play a great part in walking; but they are here kept at rest, and so do not lose the correct idea of K 5 ,n. There is no correlation between lines 2 and 3, and thence the sub ject of 3 will hold on its upward way without condescending to 2. Khl%-izt finds an unsatisfactory auspice in paragraph 4.

This illustrates the difference between the advance in Shang (46) and that in jTien.

The improve ment of the manners, moreover, flows from the maintenance of the extraordinary virtue; which implies also a gradual operation and progress.’ Paragraph 1, The danger is the result of circumstances; the small officer has not brought it on himself. Paragraph 2. Only the geese appear in this paragraph; but the writer is thinking of the advancing officer.

When, as a stranger, he treats those below him (as the line indicates), the right relation between him and them is lost. 4. ‘The stranger is in a resting-place:’—but he has not got his proper position. ‘ He has the means of livelihood, and the axe: — but his mind is not at ease. 5. ‘ In the end he will obtain praise and a (high) charge: ’—he has reached a high place. 6. ‘Considering that the stranger is here.at the very height (of distinction),’ with the spirit that possesses him, it is right he (should be emblemed by a bird) burning (its nest)._______ Line 3 has a correlate in 6, which is weak, and as it were out of the game.

Different attempts are made to bring the idea of si travelling stranger out of the trigrams Kiln and Li; but none of them is satisfactory. Let Khung Ying-ta's view serve as a specimen of them:—'Afire on a mountain lays hold of the grass, and runs with it over the whole space, not slopping anywhere long, and soon disappearingsuch is the emblem of the traveller.’ The application may be derived well enough from the attributes of the trigrams; but does not fit in with the lessons of the Thwan and Hsiang. The meanness of the subject of line i does not arise from the nature of his occupation; but from his mind and aim being emptied of all that is good and ennobling. Strong and trusty servants are the most important condition for the comfort and progress of the traveller; and therefore it alone is resumed and expanded. The subject of line 3 treats those below him with violence and arrogance, which of course alienates them from him. ‘He has not got into his proper position’ seems to say no more than that 4 is a strong line in an even place. It is difficult to say what ‘he has reached a high place’ means. The fifth line is not in this hexagram the ruler’s seat; but by his qualities and gifts the subject of it attracts the attention and regard of his friends and of his ruler. The spirit that possesses the subject of line 6 is one of haughty arrogance, with which the humility that ought to characterise him cannot co-exist, His careless self-sufficiency has shut his mind against all lessons of wisdom. hex. 5 p APPENDIX II. firmness of a brave soldier: ’—his mind would in that case be well governed. 2. ‘ The good fortune springing from what bor ders on confusion’ is due to the position (of the line) in the centre. 3. ‘The regret arising from the violent and repeated efforts to penetrate’ shows the exhaustion of the will. 4. ‘ He takes game in his hunting, enough for the threefold use of it: ’-he achieves merit. 5. ‘ The good fortune of (the subject of) the fifth line, undivided,’ is owing to its correct position and its being in the centre. 6. ‘ The representative of penetration is beneath a couch: ’—though occupying the topmost place, his powers are exhausted. 1 He has lost the axe with which he executed his decisions;’—though he try to be correct, theie will be evil. LVII. I have said on the Thwan that some commentators make the upper trigram symbolical of the ordinances of the ruler and the lower symbolical of the obedience of the people. E. g„ -YMng-pe says‘ Superiors, in harmony with the duty of inferiors, issue their commands; inferiors, in harmony with the wishes of their supe riors, follow them, Above and below there are that harmony and deference; and this is the significance of the redoubled Sun, When governmental commands and business are in accoi dance with w at is right, they agree with the tendencies of the minds of the people who follow them.’ Paragraph a seems to say that the sincerity of purpose indicated by the central position of the second line conducts its subject to the right course, despite the many considerations that might dis tract him. , ,, , a j ‘The will is exhausted’ in paragraph 3 intimates that the rep efforts ’ made by its subject have exhausted him.

What is said in paragraph 6 proceeds on a different view of the Text from that which I have followed, LVIII. The application of the Great Symbolism here will recall to many readers the Hebrew maxims in Proverbs xxvii. 17,19. The sentiment of it, however, does not readily fit in to the teaching of the hexagram as set forth in the Text. There is nothing in the conduct of the subject of line x to awaken suspicion.

Nor is it easy to account for the extension of what is said in the Text about the establishment of the ancestral temple to the presentation also of offerings to God. Probably the writer had the same idea in his mjnd as in the Great Symbolism of hexagram 16, q. v. ‘The natural course’ pursued by the subject of line 1 is, pro bably, that required by the time.

Various explanations of the Great Symbolism have been attempted. E.g, Khl ng-jze says:-' The water which a lake or marsh will contain is limited to a certain quantity. If the water flowing in exceed that, it overflows. This gives us the idea of iTieh.' What is found on the application of it is to my mind equally unsatisfactory. The subject of line i knows when he might have free course and when he is obstructed, and acts accordingly. He is regulated by a consideration of the time. The subject of line 1 ought not to act, and he is still. The sub- ject of line a ought to act, and he also is si, 11 .

LXIV, In this last hexagram we have water below and fire above, so that the two cannot act on each other, and the Symbolism may represent the unregulated condition of general affairs, the different classes of society not harmonising nor acting together. The appli cation follows naturally. Kt Hsi and others suspect an error in the text of paragraph 1; yet a tolerable meaning comes from it as it stands, The Khang-hsl editors observe on paragraph z that an undivided line in the second place, and a divided line in the fifth place, are both incorrect, and yet it is often said of them that with firm cor rectness in their subjects there will be good fortune;—such is the virtue of the central position. This principle is at last clearly enun ciated in this paragraph. jOang-^ze says‘ The subject of line 4 has the ability which the time requires, and possesses also a firm solidity. He can carry out therefore his purpose. There will be good fortune, and all cause for repentance will disappear. The smiting of the demon region was the highest example of firm correctness.' Both the symbols in paragraph 6 indicate a want of caution, and an unwillingness, to submit one's impulses to the regulation of reason and prudence. CHAP. r. APPENDIX III. APPENDIX III. The Great Appendix. Section I. Chapter I. i. Heaven is lofty and honourable; earth is low. (Their symbols), AAien and Khwan, (with their respective meanings), were determined (in accordance with this). Things low and high appear displayed in a similar relation. The (upper and lower trigrams, and the relative position of individual lines, as) noble and mean, had their places assigned accordingly. Movement and rest are the regular qualities (of their respective subjects). Idence comes the definite distinction (of the several lines) as the strong and the weak. (Affairs) are arranged together according to their tendencies, and things are divided according to their classes. Hence were produced (the interpretations in the Yi, concerning) what is good [or lucky] and evil [or unlucky]. In the heavens there are the (different) figures there completed, and on the earth there are the (different) bodies there formed. (Corresponding to them) were the changes and transformations exhi bited (in the Yl). 2. After this fashion a strong and a weak line were manipulated together (till there were the eight trigrams), and those eight trigrams were added, each to itself and to all the others, (till the sixty-four hexagrams were formed). 3. We have the exciting forces of thunder and lightning; the fertilising influences of wind and rain ; and the revolutions of the sun and moon, which give rise to cold and warmth. 4. The attributes expressed by Kh'xtn constitute the male; those expressed by Khwan constitute the female. 5. Afiien (symbolises Heaven, which) directs the great beginnings of things; Khwan (symbolises Earth, which) gives to them their completion. 6. It is by the ease with which it proceeds that Khitti directs (as it does), and by its unhesitating response that Khwan exhibits such ability. 7. (He who attains to this) ease (of Heaven) will be easily understood, and (he who attains to this) freedom from laborious effort (of the Earth) will be easily followed. He who is easily understood will have adherents, and he who is easily followed will achieve success. He who has adherents can con tinue long, and he who achieves success can become great. To be able to continue long shows the virtue of the wise and able man; to be able to become great is the heritage he will acquire. 8. With the attainment of such ease and such freedom‘from laborious effort, the mastery is got of all principles under the sky. With the attainment of that mastery, (the sage) makes good his position in the middle (between heaven and earth). Chapter I is an attempt to show the correspondency between the phenomena of external nature ever changing, and the figures of the Yi King ever varying. The first four paragraphs, it is said, show, from the phenomena of production and transformation in external THE APPENDIXES. SFXT. I. CHAP. 2. APPENDIX HI, Chapter II. 9. The sages set forth the diagrams, inspected the emblems contained in them, and appended their explanations;—in this way the good fortune and bad (indicated by them) were made clear. 10. The strong and the weak (lines) displace each other, and produce the changes and transformations (in the figures). 11. Therefore the good fortune and evil (men tioned in the explanations) are the indications of the right and wrong (in men’s conduct of affairs), and the repentance and regret (similarly mentioned) are the indications of their sorrow and anxiety. nature, the principles on which the figures of the Y1 were made. The fifth and sixth paragraphs show, particularly, how the attri butes represented by the figures Z/nen and Khwiin are to be found in (the operations ofj heaven and earth. The last two para graphs show both those attributes embodied or realised in man. The realisation takes place, indeed, fully only in the sage or the ideal man, who thus becomes the pattern for all men. In paragraph 3 we have five of the six derivative tri- grams the six ‘ children,’ according to the nomenclature of the Wan arrangement. ‘Thunder' stands for Mn ( ~ — ), ‘light ning’ for It ( - \\ ‘wind’ for sun ( E E FEE ), ail d ‘rain’ for khan ‘The sun,’ however, is also an emblem of li, and ‘the moon’ one of kan generally said to represent ‘mountains,’ while tui (EE~E)> representing ‘collections of water,' has no place in the enumeration. Kt Hsi says that in paragraph 3 we have the natural changes seen in the phenomena of the sky, while in 4 we have such changes as find body and figure on the earth. Paragraphs 5 and 6 have both been misunderstood from neglect of the peculiar meaning of the character X’ih (), and from taking it in its common acceptation of ‘knowing.’ Both com mentaries and dictionaries point out that it is here used in the sense of 1 directing,' ‘ presiding over.’ In paragraph 7, however, it resumes its ordinary significancy. 12. The changes and transformations (of the lines) are the emblems of the advance and retrogression (of the vital force in nature). Thus what we call the strong and the weak (lines) become the emblems of day and night. The movements which take place in the six places (of the hexagram) show the course of the three extremes (i.e. of the three Powers in their perfect operation). 13. Therefore what the superior man rests in, in whatever position he is placed, is the order shown in the Yl; and the study which gives him the greatest pleasure is that of the explanations of the several lines. 14. Therefore the superior man, when living quietly, contemplates the emblems and studies the explanations of them; when initiating any move ment, he contemplates the changes (that are made in divining), and studies the prognostications from them. Thus ‘ is help extended to him from Heaven; there will be good fortune, and advantage in every movement.’ Chapter II, paragraphs 9-14, is divided into two parts. The »rmer contains paragraphs 9-12, and tells us how the sages, kmg ran and the duke of Bn, proceeded in making the Yi, so hat ie good fortune and bad of men’s courses should be indicated by in harmony with right and wrong, and the proas of tagraphs 13, 14 fam the second part, and speak of Ihe study of ie Yi by the superior man, desirous of doing what rs r,g . and icreasing his knowledge, and the advantages 1 ’ I can follow .0 some extent the first two statements 0 pam raph 12 so far as the ideas of the writer are concerned though ssertinfg any correspondence between the changes of the hues of heTS -d the operate of externa. tension of day and night, is merely an amusement he fan ,11 but fail, however, .0 grasp the idea in.he las. ® e—. h the rigram, the first line represents earth; the secon , , THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX HI. sect. r. Chapter III. 15. The Thwan speak of the em- blematic figures (of the complete diagrams). The Yao speak of the changes (taking place in the several lines). 16. The expressions about good fortune or bad are used with reference to (the figures and lines, as) being right or wrong (according to the conditions of time and place); those about repentance or regret refer to small faults (in the satisfying those con ditions) ; when it is said ‘ there will be no error,’ or ‘no blame,’ there is reference to (the subject) repairing an error by what is good. 17. Therefore the distinction of (the upper and lower trigrams and of the individual lines) as noble or mean is decided by the (relative) position (of the lines); the regulations of small and great are found in the diagrams, and the discriminations of good and bad fortune appear in the (subjoined) ex planations. 18. Anxiety against (having occasion for) re pentance or regret should be felt at the boundary line (between good and evil). The stirring up the thought of (securing that there shall be) no blame arises from (the feeling of) repentance. third, heaven; in the hexagram, the first and second lines are assigned to earth; the third and fourth, to man; and the fifth and sixth, to heaven. These are the three Powers, and each Power has 1 a Grand Extreme/ where its nature and operation are seen in their highest ideal. This is to some extent conceivable; but when I try to follow our author, and find an analogy between the course of these extremes and the movements in the places of the diagrams, I have no clue by which to trace my way. For the con cluding sentence of paragraph 14 see the duke of Mu on the last line of hexagram 14, CHAP. 4. 19. Thus of the diagrams some are small, and some are great; and of the explanations some are startling, and some are unexciting. Every one of those explanations has reference to the tendencies (indicated by the symbols). Chapter IV. 20. The Yl was made on a principle of accordance with heaven and earth, and shows us therefore, without rent or confusion, the course (of things) in heaven and earth. 21. (The sage), in accordance with (the Yi), looking up, contemplates the brilliant phenomena of the heavens, and, looking down, examines the defi nite arrangements of the earththus he knows the causes of darkness (or, what is obscure) and light (or, what is bright). He traces things to their be ginning, and follows them to their end; thus he knows what can be said about death and life. (He Chapter III, paragraphs 13-19, gives additional information about the constituent parts of the Yi, that is, the Text of the classic as we have it from king Wan and his son. The imperial editors say that it expands the meaning of the fourth paragraph, the third of chapter 2. It does do so, but this account hardly covers all its contents. ■ To understand the names ‘ small and great/ as used of the dia- grams in paragraphs i, and ij, it should be noted that hexagmms to which the divided or yin line gives their character are termed 'small,' and those where the un divided or y ang line roles are called‘great/ Xivt («,=), (12, z ) are instances of the former class; Fh (H rr; — ?.

There is a similarity between him and heaven and earth, and hence there is no contrariety in him to them. His knowledge embraces all things, and his course is (intended to be) helpful to all under the sky;—and hence he falls into no error. He acts according to the exigency of circumstances without being carried away by their current; he rejoices in Heaven and knows its ordinations;—and hence he has no anxieties. He rests in his own (present) position, and cherishes (the spirit of) generous benevolence;—and hence he can love (without reserve). 23. (Through the Y1), he comprehends as in a mould or enclosure the transformations of heaven and earth without any error; by an ever-varying adaptation he completes (the nature of) all things without exception; he penetrates to a knowledge of the course of day and night (and all other connected phenomena)it is thus that his operation is spirit like, unconditioned by place, while the changes which he produces are not restricted to any form. Chapter IY, paragraphs 20-23, > s intended still more to exalt the Yi, and seems to say that the sage by means of it can make an exhaus tive study of all principles and of human nature, till he attains to the knowledge of the ordinances of Heaven, Such is the account of the chapter given by Affi Hsf; but the second character in paragraph 21 must be understood in the signification which it has in ail the sixty-four sentences which explain the emblematic structure of the hexagrams, as-'in accordance with' and not ‘ by means of.' The CHAP. 5, Chapter V. 24. The successive movement of the inactive and active operations constitutes what is called the course (of things). imperial editors append to their statement of Jffi’s account, that it must be borne in mind that the sages had not to wait till the Yi was made to conduct their exhaustive study. They had done that before, and the Y{ may be considered as a talk on the results, drawn out in its own peculiar style. It holds the mirror up to nature; but its authors knew nature before they made it. In paragraph 21, ‘the brilliant phenomena of the heavens' are the various shining bodies of the sky, with their rising and setting; 1 the definite arrangements of the earth ’ are the different situations of its parts according to the points of the compass, and its surface as diversified by mountain and valley; and by the study of these the causes of day and night are known as being the expansion and contraction of the elementary ether. The same thing produces the facts of birth or life and death, Bing, which I have translated ‘essence,' denotes the more subtle and pure part of matter, and belongs to the grosser form of tlio elementary other; kin, or ‘spirit,’ is the breath, still material, lint purer than the png, and belongs to the finer, and more active form of the ether. Here khi is ‘ the breath of life,’ In the hwun or ‘soul (animus),’ the kli\\ predominates, and the png in the p h 0 or animal soul. At death the h w u n wanders away, ascending, and the pho descends and is changed into a ghostly shade. So did the ancient Chinese grope their way from material things to the concept and representation of what was immaterial. For my ‘characteristics of the anima and animus, 1 Dr, Med- hurst rendered ‘the circumstances and conditions of the Kwei Shiin s’ (Theology of the Chinese, pp. 10-12); but he observes that ‘ the Kwei Shins in the passage are evidently the expanding and contracting principles of human life.’ The kwei sh&ns are brought about by the dissolution of the human frame, and consist of the expanding and ascending shan, which rambles about in space, and of the contracted and shrivelled kwei, which reverts to earth and nonentity. It is difficult to express one’s self clearly on a subject treated so briefly and enigmatically in the text. We must understand that the subject of the predicates in this and the next two paragraphs is ‘ the sage,’ who has endeavoured to give a transcript of his views and doings in the Y i The character, THE APPENDIXES. 25. That which ensues as the result (of their movement) is goodness; that which shows it in its completeness is the natures (of men and things). 26. The benevolent see it and call it benevolence. The wise see it and call it wisdom. The common people, acting daily according to it, yet have no knowledge of it. Thus it is that the course (of things), as seen by the superior man, is seen by few. 27. It is manifested in the benevolence (of its operations), and (then again) it conceals and stores up its resources. It gives their stimulus to all things, without having the same anxieties that pos sess the sage. Complete is its abundant virtue and the greatness of its stores! 28. Its rich possessions is what is intended by ‘ the greatness of its stores; ’ the daily renovation which it produces is what is meant by 1 the abun dance of its virtue.’ 29. Production and reproduction is what is called (the process of) change 30. The formation of the semblances (shadowy forms of things) is what we attribute to Khxtw ; the giving to them their specific forms is what we attri bute to Khwan. 31. The exhaustive use of the numbers (that turn which I have translated by ‘ spirit-like ’ in paragraph 23, is different from Hi in paragraph 21. It is shan, a character of the phonetic class, while its primary material signification has not been satis factorily ascertained. ‘ The Chinese,' says P. Regis (vol. ii. p. 445), ‘use it in naming the soul, true angels, and the genii of idola ters; and the Christian Chinese use it when they speak of God, of the Holy Spirit, of angels, and of the soul of man. For what else could they do?’ chap. 5. APPENDIX HI. up in manipulating the stalks), and (thereby) knowing (the character of) coming events, is what we call prognosticating; the comprehension of the changes (indicated leads us to) what we call the business (to be done). 32. That which is unfathomable in (the move ment of) the inactive and active operations is (the presence of a) spiritual (power). Chapter V, paragraphs 24-32, still shows us the Yi fashioned so as to give a picture of the phenomena of the external universe; but the writer dwells more on the latter, and the different para graphs give an interesting view of his ideas on the subject. He supposes a constant change from rest to movement and from movement to rest, through which all things are formed, now still, now in motion, now expanding, now contracting. It is customary to speak of two forms of an original ether as the two elementary principles, but they are really one and the same ether, in a twofold condition, with a twofold action. By their successive movement the phenomena of existence are produced,—what I have called ‘ the course (of things) ’ in paragraph 24. It is attempted, however, by many native scholars and by some sinologists, to give to tao, the last character in that paragraph, the meaning of ‘ reason,' that which intelligently guides and directs the movements of the two elements. But this view is not in harmony with the scope of the chapter, nor can the characters be fairly construed so as to justify such an interpretation. The imperial editors say that the germ of the Mencian doctrine about the goodness of human nature is in paragraph 25 ; but it says more widely, that ‘ every creature is good, according to its ideal as from the plastic yin and yang. But few, the next para graph tells us, can understand the measure of this goodness. ‘The benevolent operations’ in the course of things in para graph %) are illustrated from the phenomena of growth and beauty in spring and summer; and the cessation of these in autumn and winter may be called ‘ a concealing and storing them up. Paragraph 29 seems to state the origin of the name Yi as applied to the book, the Yi King. In paragraph 30 the names Khk n and Khwan take the place of yin and yang, as used in paragraphs 24 and 32, In -Oien, 35 ^ THE APPENDIXES, SECT, I. Chapter VI. 33. Yes, wide is the Yi and great! If we speak of it in its farthest reaching, no limit can be set to it; if we speak of it with reference to what is near at hand, (its lessons are) still and correct; if we speak of it in connexion with all between heaven and earth, it embraces all. 34. There is Klnt n. In its (individual) stillness it is self-absorbed; when exerting its motive power it goes straight forward; and thus it is that its pro ductive action is on a grand scale. There is Khwan. In its (individual) stillness, it is self-collected and capacious; when exerting its motive power, it de- velopes its resources, and thus its productive action is on a wide scale. 35. In its breadth and greatness, (the Yi) corre- the symbol of heaven, every one of its three lines is undivided; it is the concentration of the yang faculty; so Klnvan, the symbol of the earth, is the concentration of the yin, The critics them selves call attention to the equivalence of the symbolic names here given to yin and yang. The connexion of the two is necessary to the production of any one substantial thing, The yang origin ates a shadowy outline which the yin fills up with a definite sub stance. So actually in nature Heaven (Khkn) and Earth (KhwHn) operate together in the production of all material things and beings. The ‘numbers,’ mentioned in paragraph 31, are not all or any numbers generally, but 7,8,9, 6, those assigned to the four ‘ em blematic figures, that grow out of the undivided and divided lines, and by means of which the hexagrams are made up in divination. The 1 future or coming events ’ which are prognosticated are not particular events, which the diviner has not already forecast, but the character of events or courses of actions already contemplated, as good or evil, lucky or unlucky, in their issue. The best commentary on paragraph 32 is supplied by paragraphs 8-ro of Appendix VI, The ‘Spirit’ is that of ‘God;’ and this settles the meaning of tao in paragraph 24, as being the course of nature, in which, according to the author, ‘ God worketh all in all.' CHAP. 7 . appendix hi. sponds to heaven and earth; in its ever-recurring changes, it corresponds to the four seasons; in its mention of the bright or active, and the dark or inactive operation, it corresponds to the sun and moon; and the excellence seen in the ease and ready response (of its various operations) corresponds to the perfect operations (presented to us in the pheno mena of nature). Chapter VII. 36. The Master said:—' Is not the Yi a perfect book?’ It was by the Yi that the sages exalted their virtue, and enlarged their sphere of occupation. Their wisdom was high, and their rules of conduct were solid. That loftiness was after the pattern of heaven; that solidity, after the. pattern of earth. Chapter VI, paragraphs 33-35, goes on further to celebrate the Yi as holding up the mirror to nature in all its operations and in its widest extent. The grandiloquent language, however, amounts only to this, that, when we have made ourselves acquainted with the phenomena of nature, we can, with a heated fancy, see some analogy to them in the changes of the diagrams and lines of the Yi book. Alien and Khwkn must be taken as the same names are understood in paragraph 30 above. ‘The Yi/ with which paragraph 33 begins, must be understood also at the commencement of paragraph 35. The character which I have translated by ‘ corresponds' throughout this last chapter, should not, it is observed, have stress laid upon it. IT Hsi says that it is simply equal to the ‘there is a similarity' of paragraph 23. ‘The bright or active element' and ‘the dark or inactive’ arc in the original, ‘ the yang and the yin.’ The correspondence predicted between them and the sun and moon, the brightness and warmth of the one, and the paleness and coldness of the other, shows us how those names arose, and that it is foreign to the original concept of them to call them ‘ the male and female principles: ’—with the last clause compare paragraphs 6-8. THE APPENDIXES. SECT. I, 37. Heaven and earth having their positions as assigned to them, the changes (of nature) take place between them. The nature (of man) having been completed, and being continually preserved, it is the gate of all good courses and righteousness, Chapter VIII. 38. The sage was able to survey all the complex phenomena under the sky. He then considered in his mind how they could be figured, and (by means of the diagrams) represented their material forms and their character. Hence these (diagrams) are denominated Semblances (or emblematic figures, the Hsiang). 39. A (later) sage was able to survey the motive influences working all under the sky. He contenv plated them in their common action and special nature, in order to bring out the standard and proper tendency of each. He then appended his Chapter VII, paragraphs 36,37, is understood to set forth how the sages embodied the teachings of the Yf in their character and conduct. But when it is said that Mt was by the Yt that they exalted their virtue and enlarged their sphere of occupation,’ the meaning can only be that what they did in these directions was in harmony with the principles which they endeavoured to set forth in the symbols of the Yf. ‘ Their rules of conduct were solid/ in paragraph 36, is, literally, ‘ their rules were low.’ To the height of heaven reached by the wisdom of the sages, the author opposes the low-lying earth, between which and their substantial practices and virtues he.dis covered some analog]'. It will be seen that the chapter commences with ‘The Master said.’ M Hsf observes that ‘as the Ten Appendixes were all made by the Master, these words are out of place, and that he conjectures that wherever they occur here and elsewhere, they were added after the sage's time,’ Their occurrence very seri ously affects the question of the authorship of the Appendixes, which I have discussed in the Introduction, pages 28-31. explanation (to each line of the diagrams), to deter mine the good or evil indicated by it. Hence those (lines with their explanations) are denominated Imi tations (the Y ho). 40. (The diagrams) speak of the most complex phenomena under the sky, and yet there is nothing in them that need awaken dislike; the explanations of the lines speak of the subtlest movements under the sky, and yet there is nothing in them to produce confusion. 41. (A learner) will consider what is said (under the diagrams), and then speak; he will deliberate on what is said (in the explanations of the lines), and then move. By such consideration and deliberations he will be able to make all the changes which he undertakes successful. 42. ‘Here hid, retired, cries out the crane; Her young’s responsive cry sounds there. Of spirits good I drain this cup; With thee a cup I’ll freely share.’ The Master said‘ The superior man occupies his apartment and sends forth his words. If they be good, they will be responded to at a distance of more than a thousand lihow much more will they be so in the nearer circle! He occupies his apart ment and sends forth his words. If they be evil, they will , awaken opposition at a distance of more than a thousand 11;—how much more will they do so in the nearer circle! Words issue from ones person, and proceed to affect the people. Actions proceed from what is near, and their effects are seen at a distance. Words and actions are the hinge and spring of the superior man. The movement of that THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX III. hinge and spring determines glory or disgrace. His words and actions move heaven and earth;—may he be careless in regard to them ? ’ 43. ' (The representative of) the union of men first cries out and weeps, and afterwards laughs.’ The Master said, on this;— ‘ The ways of good men (different seem). This in a public office toils; That in his home the time beguiles. One man his lips with silence seals; Another all his mind reveals. But when two men are one in heart, Not iron bolts keep them apart; The words they in their union use, Fragrance like orchid plants diffuse.’ 44. ‘The first line, undivided, shows its subject placing mats of the white grass beneath what he sets on the ground.’ The Master said' To place the things on the ground might be considered suf ficient; but when he places beneath them mats of the white grass, what occasion for blame can there be ? Such a course shows the height of care fulness. The white grass is a trivial thing, but through the use made of it, it may become impor tant. He who goes forward using such careful art will not fall into any error.’ 45. ‘ A superior man toiling laboriously and yet humble! He will bring things to an end, and with good fortune.’ The Master said on this:—‘He toils with success, but does not boast of it; he achieves merit, but takes no virtue to himself from it ; this is the height of generous goodness, and speaks of the. man who with (great) merit yet places CHAP. 8, himself below others. He wishes his virtue to be more and more complete, and in his intercourse with others to be more and more respectful;—he who is so humble, carrying his respectfulness to the utmost, will be able to preserve himself in his position.’ 46. ‘The dragon (is seen) beyond his proper haunts; there will be occasion for repentance.’ The Master said on this:—‘ He is noble, but is not in his correct place; he is on high, but there are no people to acknowledge him; there is a man of virtue and ability below, but he will not assist him. Hence whatever movement he may make will give occasion for repentance.’ 47. ‘ He does not quit the courtyard before his door—there will be no occasion for blame.’ The Master said on this‘ When disorder arises, it will be found that (ill-advised) speech was the stepping- stone to it. If a ruler do not keep secret (his deliberations with his minister), he will lose that minister. If a minister do not keep secret (his deliberations with his ruler), he will lose his life. If (important) matters in the germ be not kept secret, that will be injurious to their accomplish ment. Therefore the superior man is careful to maintain secrecy, and does not allow himself to speak.’ 48. The Master said:-’ The makers of the Y i may be said to have known (the philosophy of) robbery. The Yi says, “ He is a burden-bearer, and yet rides in a carriage, thereby exciting robbers to attack him.” Burden-bearing is the business of a small man. A carriage is the vehicle of a gentleman. When a small man rides in the vehicle of a gentle- THE APPENDIXES. SECT. I, man, robbers will think of taking it from him. (When one is) insolent to those above him, and oppressive to those below, robbers will wish to attack him. Careless laying up of things excites to robbery, (as a woman’s) adorning of herself excites to lust. What the Y1 says about the burden- bearer’s riding in a carriage, and exciting robbers to attack him, (shows how) robbery is called out.' Chapter VIII, paragraphs 38-48. In the first two paragraphs here we have an account of the formation of the diagra ms, and of the explanation of the whole hexagrams and of the individual lines. ‘The sage’ in paragraph 38 is intended presumably of Ffi-hst; but we cannot say, from it, whether the writer thought of him as having formed only the eight trigrams, or all the sixty-four hexagrams. In the diagrams, however, we have semblances, or representations, of the phenomena of nature, even the most com plex, and hard to be disentangled. Paragraph 39 goes on to speak of the explanation more expecially of the individual lines, by the duke of iffiu, as symbolical of good luck or evil, as they turned up in the processes of divination. Paragraph 40 declares the usableness (so to speak) of the dia grams and the explanations of them; and 41 shows us how a learner or consulter of the Y1 would actually proceed in using it. In paragraphs 42-48 we have the words of Confucius on seven lines in so many hexagrams, or rather his amplification of the words of the duke of Zau’s explanations of their symbolism. The lines are 2 of hexagram 61; 5 of 13; x of 28; 3 of 15; 6 of 1; 1 of 60; and 3 of 40. What Confucius says is not without in terest, but does not make the principles on which the Yi was made any clearer to us. It shows how his object was to turn the symbolism that he found to a moral or ethical account; and no doubt he could have varied the symbolism, if he had been inclined to do so. 1 have spoken in the preceding chapter of the difficulty which e phrase ‘The Master said’ presents to our accepting the Ap pendix as from the hand of Confucius himself. But his words in paragraph 43 are in rhyme. He did not speak so. If be rhymed his explanation of the symbolism of the line that is the ground work of that paragraph, why did he not rhyme his explanations of CHAP. 9 . APPENDIX III. Chapter IX. 49. To heaven belongs (the num ber) 1; to earth, 2; to heaven, 3; to earth, 4; to heaven, 5; to earth, 6 ; to heaven, 7; to earth, 8; to heaven, 9; to earth, 10. 50. The numbers belonging to heaven are five, and those belonging to earth are (also) five. The numbers of these two series correspond to each other (in their fixed positions), and each one has another that may be considered its mate. The heavenly numbers amount to 25, and the earthly to 30. The numbers of heaven and earth together amount to 55. It is by these that the changes and transformations are effected, and the spirit-like agencies kept in movement. 51. The numbers of the Great Expansion, (multi plied together), make 50, of which (only) 49 are used (in divination), (The stalks representing these) are divided into two heaps to represent the two (emblematic lines, or heaven and earth). One is then taken (from the heap on the right), and placed (between the little finger of the left hand and the next), that there may thus be symbolised the three (powers of heaven, earth, and man), (The heaps on both sides) are manipulated by fours to repre sent the four seasons; and then the remainders are returned, and placed (between) the two middle fingers of the left hand, to represent the intercalary month. In five years there are two intercalations, and there fore there are two operations; and afterwards the whole process is repeated. 52. The numbers (required) for K/ik n (or the the other lines ? To answer these questions categorically is beyond our power. The facts that suggest them increase the difficulty in ascribing this and the other additions to the Yi to the later sage. THE APPENDIXES. undivided line) amount to 216; those for Khwan (or the divided line), to 144. Together they are 360, corresponding to the days of the year. 53. The number produced by the lines in the two parts (of the Yl) amount to 11,520, correspond ing to the number of all things. 54. Therefore by means of the four operations is the Y! completed. It takes 18 changes to form a hexagram. 55. (The formation of) the eight trigrams consti tutes the small completion (of the Yl). 56. If we led on the diagrams and expanded them, if we prolonged each by the addition of the proper lines, then all events possible under the sky might have their representation. 57* (The diagrams) make manifest (by their ap pended explanations), the ways (of good and ill fortune), and show virtuous actions in their spiritual relations. In this way, by consulting them, we may receive an answer (to our doubts), and we may also by means of them assist the spiritual (power in its agency in nature and providence). 58. The Master said‘ He who knows the method of change and transformation may be said to know what is done by that spiritual (power).’ Chapter IX, paragraphs 49-58, is of a different character from any of the preceding, and treats, unsatisfactorily, of the use of numbers in connexion with the figure of the Yl and the practice of divination. In the 7 hang edition of the Yl, published in the seventh century, paragraph 49 is the first of the eleventh chapter according to the arrangement now followed, if/rang-jze restored it to its present place, which it occupied, as has been proved, during the Han CHAP. tO. APPENDIX III. Chapiter X. 59, In the Yl there are four things characteristic of the way of the sages. We should set the highest value on its explanations to guide dynasty, and to which it properly belongs. It and the next para graph should be taken together, and are distinct from what fol lows, though the Thang edition is further confused in placing 51 before 50, In 49 and 50 ‘heaven’ and ‘earth’ are used as we have seen jsT/nen and Khwan are in paragraphs 30 and 34, Odd num bers belong to the strong or undivided line, which is symbolical of the active operation in nature, and the even numbers to the weak or divided line, symbolical of its inaction. The phiaseology of the paragraphs, however, can only be understood by a reference to ‘ the river map,’ which has been given in the Introduction, pages 15,16. The map, as it appeared on the back of 1 the dragon-horse, con sisted of so many circles, and so many dark circular maikings, the former, it was assumed, being of the yang character, and the latter of the yin. Fh-hsl for the circle substituted the strong or undivided line (-■), and for the dark markings the weak or divided (— —). It will be seen that the yang symbols are the 1, 3, 5,) and 9 circles, and the yin are the 2, 4,6,8 and 10 cir cular markings, which is the pictorial delineation of paragiaph 49. The only thing to be said upon it is that the arrangement of the five circles and ten circular markings is peculiar and evidently devised ‘for a purpose.’ So far, however, as we know, no figure of the map was attempted till after the beginning of our twelfth The same figure is supposed to illustrate what ts said m para graph so: 'The numbers of the two series correspond to each other in their fixed positions.’ r and 2, and 3 an 4 certain y ro each other, and perhaps 5 and 6; hut 7 and 8, an 9 an not do so in the same way.

The last statement in the paragraph, however, derives no dta .ration, so far as I can see, from the figure. How can & nnm- hers effect the things that are predated of THE APPENDIXES, SECT, I, us in speaking; on its changes for (the initiation of) our movements; on its emblematic figures for (defi nite action as in) the construction of implements; jargon indeed about the formation of the five elements, but in order to make it appear not reasonable, but capable of being; related, writers call in ‘ the Lo writing' to the aid of ‘the Ho map; ’ and ‘ the five elements' is a division of the constituents of material things, which is foreign to the Yi. Paragraph 51 is intended to describe the process of divination in manipulating the stalks, but the description is confused by intro ducing into it the four seasons and the subject of intercalation, so as to be very difficult to understand. In the middle of the Ho map are the five circles symbolical of heaven and the ten dark terrestrial markings (live above and five below the others). These multiplied together give fifty, which form ‘ the great expansion. But 50 divining stalks or slips, when divided, give either two odd numbers or two even; and therefore one was put on one side. The remaining 49, however divided, were sure to give two parcels of stalks, one containing an even number of stalks, and the other an odd, and so might be said fan cifully to represent the undivided or strong, and the divided or weak line. It is needless to go minutely into the other steps of the process. Then comes in the counting the stalks by four, because there are four seasons in the year, and those that remain represent the intercalary days. But how could sucli a process be of any value to determine the days necessary to be intercalated in any particular year? The paragraph shows, however, that, when it was written, the rule was to intercalate two months in five years. But it does not say how many days would remain to be carried on to the sixth year after the second intercalation. Paragraph 52. The actual number of the undivided and divided lines in the hexagrams is the same, 192 of each, But the repre sentative number of an undivided line is 9, and of a divided line 6. Now 9x4 (the number of the emblematic figures) x 6 (the lines of each hexagram)=216; and 6x4x6=144. The sum of these products is 360, which was assumed, for the purpose of working the intercalation, as the standard length of the year. But this was derived from observation, and other considerations;—it did not come out of the Yi, Paragraphs 53-56. The number in 53 arises thus:—192 (the CHAP. 10. APPENDIX III. 369 and on its prognostications for our practice of divination. 60. Therefore, when a superior man is about to take action of a more private or of a public character, he asks (the Yi), making his inquiry in words. It receives his order, and the answer comes as the echo’s response. Be the subject remote or near, mysterious or deep, he forthwith knows of what kind will be the coming result. (If the Yi) were not the most exquisite thing under heaven, would it be concerned in such an operation as this ? 61. (The stalks) are manipulated by threes and fives to determine (one) change; they are laid on opposite sides, and placed one up, one down, to make sure of their numbers; and the (three necessary) number of each series of lines in the sixty-four hexagrams) x 36 (obtained as abovc)=fi9i2, and 192 x 24=4608, the sum of which = 11,520. This is said to be ‘the number of all things,’ the meaning of which I do not know. The ‘four operations’ are those described in paragraph 31. They were thrice repeated in divination to determine each new line, and of course it took eighteen of them to form a hexagram. The diagrams might be extended ad infinitum, both in the number of lines and of figures, by the natural process of their formation as shown in the Introduction, page 14, without the aid of the divining stalks; and no sufficient reason can be given why the makers of the figures stopped at sixty-four. It is difficult to believe the first statement in paragraph 5? and to understand the second. What is it ‘to Shan or spiritualise virtuous actions?’ The concluding statement approximates to impiety. We may grant what is affirmed in paragraph 58, but does the Yi really give us any knowledge of the processes of change and transformation in nature? What wiser are we after all the affirmations about numbers? ‘Change'schangings, understood activelythe work of Heaven; ‘transformations =■evolution.—the finish given by earth to the changing caused by Heaven. 37 ° THE APPENDIXES. changes are gone through with in this way, till they form the figures pertaining to heaven or to earth. Their numbers are exactly determined, and the emblems of (all things) under the sky are fixed. (If the Yi) were not the thing most capable of change of all things under heaven, how could it effect such a result as this ? 62. In (all these operations forming) the Yi, there is no thought and no action. It is still and without movement; but, when acted on, it penetrates forth with to all phenomena and events under the sky. If it were not the most spirit-like thing under the sky, how could it be found doing this ? 63. The (operations forming the) Yi are the method by which the sages searched out exhaus tively what was deep, and investigated the minutest springs (of things). 64. ‘Those operations searched out what was deep: ’—therefore they could penetrate to the views of all under the sky. ‘ They made apparent the minutest springs of (things): ’—therefore they could bring to a completion all undertakings under the sky. ‘ Their action was spirit-like: —therefore they could make speed without hurry, and reached their destination without travelling. 65. This is the import of what the Master said, that ( In the Yi there are four things indicating the way of the sages.’ Chapter X, paragraphs 59-65, enlarges on the service rendered to men by the Yi, owing to the way in which it was made by the sages to express their views and carry into effect their wishes. Paragraph 59 mentions the four things in which its usefulness appears. ‘The emblematic figures’ are the four hsiang, which are produced by the manipulation of the undivided and divided chap. ir. appendix III, Chapter XI. 66. The Master said:—‘What is it that the Y i does ? The Y i opens up (the knowledge of the issues of) things, accomplishes the undertak ings (of men), and embraces under it (the way of) all things under the sky. This and nothing more is what the Y i does. Thereby the sages, through (divination by) it, would give their proper course to the aims of all under the sky, would give stability to their undertakings, and determine their doubts.’ 67. Therefore the virtue of the stalks is versatile lines, and whose representative numbers are 9,8,7,6. ‘Divination' appears in the paragraph as pu-shih, which means ‘ divination by the tortoise-shell and by the stalks.’ But the tortoise-shell had nothing to do with the use of the Yi. Before the composition of these Appendixes the two terms must have been combined to express the practice of divination, without reference to its mode. Paragraph 60 speaks of the explanations and prognostications of the YI The 1 exquisiteness ’ ascribed to it would be due to the sages who had devised it, and appended their explanations to it; but the whole thing has no existence save in cloud-land. Paragraph 61 speaks of the operations with the stalks till the various changes in the results issued in the determination of the emblematic figures, and then in the fixing of the individual lines and entire hexagrams. Even Zu Hsi admits that the references to the different processes are now hardly intelligible. Paragraph 62. ITow could the writer speak of the Yi without thought or action as being most * spirit-like ? ’ If it did what he asserts, those who contrived it might be so described ? They would have been beings whose operation was indeed like that of spirits, inscrutable, ‘unfathomable’ (paragraph 32), even like that of the Spirit of God (VI, id). . , Paragraphs 63 and 64 ought not to be taken as saying that the sages did the' things described for themselves by the Yi. They knew them of themselves, and made the YI that others might come by it to do the same. So the writer imagined, No words could indicate more clearly than those of paragraph 65 that the para graphs between it and 59 did not come from Confucius, but from the compiler of the Great Appendix, whoever he was. m THE APPENDIXES. and spirit-like; that of the diagrams is exact and wise; and the meaning given by the six lines is changeful to give (the proper information to men). The sages having, by their possession of these (three virtues), cleansed their minds, retired and laid them up in the secrecy (of their own conscious ness). But their sympathies were with the people in regard both to their good fortune and evil. By their spirit-like ability they knew (the character of) coming events, and their wisdom had stored up (all experiences of) the past. Who could be able to accomplish all this ? (Only our) ancient sages, quick in apprehension and clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing know ledge, and with a majesty, going spirit-like to its objectsit was only they who could do so. 68. Therefore (those sages), fully understanding the way of Heaven, and having clearly ascertained the experience of the people, instituted (the employ ment of) these spirit-like things, as a provision for the use of the people. The sages went about the employment of them (moreover) by purifying their hearts and with reverent caution, thereby giving (more) spirituality and intelligence to their virtue. 69. Thus, a door shut may be pronounced (analo gous to) Khwan (or the inactive condition), and the opening of the door (analogous to) Khltix (or the active condition). The opening succeeding the being shut may be pronounced (analogous to what we call) a change; and the passing from one of these states to the other may be called the constant course (of things). The (first) appearance of anything (as a bud) is CHAP. II. APPENDIX III. what we call a semblance; when it has received its complete form, we call it a definite thing. (The divining-plant having been produced, the sages) set it apart and laid down the method of its employment,—what we call the laws (of divination). The advantage arising from it in external and in ternal matters, so that the people all use it, stamps it with a character which we call spirit-like. 70. Therefore in (the system of) the Yi there is the Grand Terminus, which produced the two ele mentary Forms. Those two Forms produced the Four emblematic Symbols, which again produced the eight Trigrams. 71. The eight trigrams served to determine the good and evil (issues of events), and from this detei- mination was produced the (successful prosecution of the) great business (of life). 72. Therefore of all things that furnish models and visible figures there are none greater than heaven and earth; of things that change and ex tend an influence (on others) there are none greater than the four seasons; of things suspended (in the sky) with their figures displayed clear and bright, there are none greater than the sun and moon; of the honoured and exalted there are none greater than he who is the rich and noble (one);. in pre paring things for practical use, and inventing and making instruments for the benefit of all under the sky, there are none greater than the sages; to ex plore what is complex, search out what is hidden, to hook up what lies deep, and reach to what is dis tant, thereby determining (the issues) for good or ill of all events under the sky, and making all men under heaven full of strenuous endeavours, there THE APPENDIXES. are no (agencies) greater than those of the stalks and the tortoise-shell. 73. Therefore Heaven produced the spirit-like things, and the sages took advantage of them. (The operations of) heaven and earth are marked by (so many) changes and transformations; and the sages imitated them (by means of the Yl). Heaven hangs out its (brilliant) figures from which are seen good fortune and bad, and the sages made their emblema tic interpretations accordingly. The Ho gave forth the map, and the Lo the writing, of (both of) which the sages took advantage. 74. In the (scheme of the) Yt there are the four symbolic figures by which they inform men (in divin ing of the lines making up the diagrams); the expla nations appended to them convey the significance (of the diagrams and lines); and the determination (of the divination) as fortunate or the reverse, to settle the doubts (of men). Chapter XI, paragraphs 66-74, treats of divination, and the scheme of it supplied in the Yi. That scheme must be referred first to Heaven, which produced the spirit-like things,—the divining- plant and the tortoise; and next to the sages, who knew the mind of Heaven, and made the plant and shell subservient to the pur pose for which they were intended. Paragraph 66 answers the question of what the Yi does; and if theie were truth or reason in it, the book and its use would be most important. I have closed the quotation of “the Master's” words at the end of the paragraph; but really we do not know if they extend so far, or farther. _ P ara £ ra phs 67 and 68 glorify the sages and their work. The virtues of the divining-plant all belonged to them, and it was thus that they were able to organise the scheme of divination. The production of‘ the spirit-like things ’ is, in paragraph 73, ascribed to Heaven; the characters about them in these paragraphs mean no more than is expressed in the translation. CHAP. 12. APPENDIX TIL Chapter XII. 75. It is said in the Yi, ‘Help is given to him from Heaven. There will be good fortune; advantage in every respect.’ The Master Paragraph 69 shows how the antinomy of the yin and yang pervades all nature, and how the sages turned it, as existing pre eminently in the divining-plant, to account. Paragraph 70. Evidently the author had in view here the genesis of the diagrams of the Yi, the number of figures increasing in a geometrical progression with the ratio of 2, while the lines of the figures form an arithmetical progression with the common differ ence of I. This is quite plain after‘the two elementary forms (_and-) ’ have been made. They give birth to ‘ the four emblematic symbols/ each of two lines (:=:, =r=r, = =, known, in this order, as the Grand or old Yang, the young Yin, the young Yang, and the Grand or old Yin). By the addition to each of these symbols first of the yang line, and then of the yin, there arise the eight trigrams, each of three lines, and the process of formation might be continued indefinitely. But how was the first step taken in the formation of the two ele mentary lines ? Here, it is said, they were produced by the Thai A'i, or the Grand Terminus. This is represented in Ah Hsf s ‘Youth’s Introduction to the Study of the Yi, by a circle; but he tells us that that representation of it was first made by Aau-jze (a.p. 1017-1073, called also Jfiu Tun-!, M u Mftwhfl, and, most of all, M u Lien-Mi), and that his readers must be careful not to suppose that Ffl-hst had such a figure in his mind’s eye, I fail myself to understand how there can be generated from a circle the undivided and the broken line. Given those two lines, and the formation of the sixty-four hexagrams proceeds regularly according to the method above described. We must start from them, whether we can account or not rnr the rise of the idea of them in the mind of Ffi-hsi. ' Ai , Leaving the subject of the figure of the Thai Ki, the name gives us hardly any clue to its meaning. EX is used for the extreme term of anything, as the ridge-pole of a house, or the pinnacle 0 a pagoda. The comment on the first sentence in the paragraph by Wang Pi (a.d. 226-249) isExistence must begin m non existence, and therefore the Grand Terminus produced the two elementary Forms. Thai K\\ is the denomination of what has no denomination. As it cannot be named, the text takes the extreme THE APPENDIXES. said:—* Yii (jjjjf) is the symbol of assisting. He whom Heaven assists is observant (of what is right); he whom men assist is sincere. The individual here indicated treads the path of sincerity and desires to be observant (of what is right), and studies to exalt the worthy. Hence “Help is given to him from Heaven. There will be good fortune, advantage in every respect.”' 76. The Master saidThe written characters are point of anything that exists as an analogous term for the Th£i AT Expanding Wang’s comment, Killing Ying-td says:—‘Thdi K\\ means the original subtle matter, that formed the one chaotic mass before heaven and earth were divided; ’ and then he refers to certain passages in lio-jze’s Tao Teh King, and identifies the Thali K\\ with his T&o. This would seem to give to Thdi K\\ a material meaning. The later philosophers of the Sung school, however, insist on its being immaterial, now calling it If, the principle of order in nature, now tao, the defined course of things, now Tf, the Supreme Power or God, now shan, the spiritual working of God. According to A 7 ;ang-jze, all these names are to be referred to that of ‘Heaven,’ of which they express so many different concepts, Paragraph 71 speaks of divination in practice, and paragraph 72 celebrates the service done by that through the plant and shell, as equal to, and indeed the complement of, all the other services ren dered by heaven and earth, the seasons, the sun and moon, the sages, and the greatest potentates, Surely, it is all very extravagant, The last two paragraphs resume the theme of the making of the Yf by the sages, and their teaching the practice of divination. Of the Ho map and the Lo writing, I have spoken in the Introduction, pages 14-18. But if we accept the statement that the Lo writing had anything to do with the making of the Yf, we must except M-hsf from the sages to whom we are indebted for it. It was to the Great Y(i, more than a thousand years later than Fft-hsi, that the Lo disclosed its writing j and Yu is never said to have had anything to do with the Yf. Nor is either of these things mentioned in Section ii, paragraph n, where the work of Fd-hsf is described more in detail. chap. 12 . appendix III. not the full exponent of speech, and speech is not the full expression of ideas;—is it impossible then to discover the ideas of the sages ? The Mastei said 1 The sages made their emblematic symbols to set forth fully their ideas; appointed (all) the diagrams to show fully the truth and falsehood (of things); appended their explanations to give the full expression of their words; and changed (the various lines) and made general the method of doing so, to exhibit fully what was advantageous. They (thus) stimulated (the people) as by drums and dances, thereby completely developing the spirit-like (character of the Yi).’ 77. May we not say that Khltn. and Khwan [= the yang and yin, or the undivided and divided lines] are the secret and substance of the Yi? Kh ien and Khwan being established in their several places, the system of changes was thereby constituted. If Kh'itw and Khwan were taken away, there would be no means of seeing that system; and if that system were not seen, Kh\\t n and Khwan would almost cease to act. 78. Hence that which is antecedent to the ma 1 terial form exists, we say, as an ideal method, and that which is subsequent to the material form exists, we say, as a definite thing. Transformation and shaping is what we .call change; carrying this out and operating with it is what we call generalising the method; taking the result and setting it forth for all the people under heaven is, we say, (securing the success of) the business of life. 79. Hence, to speak of the emblematic figures.- (The sage) was able to survey all the complex phe- THE APPENDIXES. nomena under the sky. He then considered in his mind how they could be figured, and (by means of the diagrams) represented their material forms and their character, Hence those (diagrams) are denominated Semblances. A (later) sage was able to survey the motive influences working all under the sky. He contemplated them in their common action and special nature, in order to bring out the standard and proper tendency of each. He then appended his explanation (to each line), to determine the good or evil indicated by it. Hence those (lines with their explanations) are denominated Imitations (the Yio). 80. The most thorough mastery of all the com plex phenomena under the sky is obtained from the diagrams. The greatest stimulus to movement in adaptation to all affairs under the sky is obtained from the explanations. 81. The transformations and shaping that take place are obtained from the changes (of the lines); the carrying this out and operating with it is ob tained from the general method (that has been established). The seeing their spirit-like intima tions and understanding them depended on their being the proper men; and the completing (the study of) them by silent meditation, and securing the faith of others without the use of words, de pended on their virtuous conduct. , Cha P ter xn > paragraphs 75-81, endeavours to show how we have in the Yf a representation of the changing phenomena of nature, and such a representation as words or speech could not convey, ■ Paragraph 75 has a good meaning, taken by itself; but it has no apparent connexion with the rest of the chapter., ZiHsf thought Section II. Chapter I. 1. The eight trigrams having been completed in their proper order, there were in each the (three) emblematic lines, They were then it was misplaced in its present position, and should be at the end of chapter 8 . Compare paragraph 14, The first two statements of paragraph 76 are general, but made here specially to exalt the Yt, as teaching more clearly and fully than written characters could have done. The Khang-hsi editors decide that ' the emblematic figures’ here are the eight trigrams of I'tVhsf,-against the view of M Hat, which restricts them to signify the undivided and divided lines, The repetition of the words, ‘The Master said,’ is probably the error of an early transcriber. Paragraphs 77 and 78 refer to the phenomena of nature and the course of human affairs, as suggesting and controlling the forma tion of the system of the Yf. The formation of that becomes the subject in paragraph 79, A 7 /ien and Kliw&n are used, as we have already seen them more than once, for the active and inactive con ditions in nature, indicated by the divided and undivided lines. It is difficult to translate what is said in paragraph 78, about Tfio and K/ii;— what I have called,‘an ideal method’and 'a definite’ thing. P. Regis translates the text by—‘ Quod non est inter figurata aut corporea sed supereminet est rationale, est ratio, T&o; quod (est) inter figurata subjacetque certac ligurae est sensibile, est instru- mentum,' But tao cannot here signify ratio or reason; for do and kh\\ arc names for the same thing under different conditions; first as a possibility, and next as an actuality. Such is the natural interpretation of the text, and so all ,the great scholars of the Sung dynasty construed it, as may be seen in the * Collected Comments of the imperial edition. So far they were correct, however many of them might stumble and fall in confounding this ( ideal method with God, What follows in the paragraph has no connexion with these two statements, P. Regis, who divides bis translation into two paragraphs, sa yg : — 1 Satis patet ulramque textus hujus partem non cohaerere. THE APPENDIXES, multiplied by a process of addition till the (six) component lines appeared. 2. The strong line and the weak push them selves each into the place of the other, and hence the changes (of the diagrams) take place. The appended explanations attach to every form of them its character (of good or ill), and hence the movements (suggested by divination) are deter mined accordingly. 3. Good fortune and ill, occasion for repentance or regret, all arise from these movements. 4. The strong and the weak (lines) have their fixed and proper places (in the diagrams); their changes, however varied, are according to the re quirements of the time (when they take place). 5. Good fortune and ill are continually prevailing each against the other by an exact rule. 6. By the same rule, heaven and earth, in their course, continually give forth (their lessons); the sun and moon continually emit their light; all the movements under the sky are constantly subject to this one and the same rule. Quod ergo Mas divisimus, id fecimus majoris perspicuitatis causa, non ratione ordinis qui certe nullus est, ut in re potius assuta quam connexa,’ .. . Paragraph 79 is a repetition of paragraphs 38,39, ( to introduce,’ says Zh Hst, ‘the two paragraphs’ that follow. ( The editors of the imperial edition find in 80, 81, an amplifica tion mainly of 76, showing how what is said there of the natural phenomena is exhibited in the Yi. The concluding sentence is a declaration (hardly necessary) about the sage makers, to the effect that they were as distinguished for virtuous conduct as for wisdom,—'the proper men’ to stand between Heaven and the mass of men as they did. chap. r. APPENDIX HI. 7. Kh ien, (the symbol of heaven, and) conveying the idea of strength, shows to men its easy (and natural) action. Kh wan, (the symbol of earth, and) conveying the idea of docility, shows to men its compendious (receptivity and operation). 8. The Yao (or lines) are imitative representa tions of this. The Hsiang, or emblematic figures, are pictorial representations of the same. 9. The movements of the lines and figures take place (at the hand of the operator), and are un seen; the good fortune or ill is seen openly and is beyond. The work to be done appears by the changes; the sympathies of the sages are seen in their explanations. 10. The great attribute of heaven and earth is the giving and maintaining life. What is most precious for the sage is to get the (highest) place— (in which he can be the human representative of heaven and earth). What will guard this position for him ? Men. How shall he collect a large population round him ? By the power of his wealth. The right administration of that wealth, correct instructions to the people, and prohibitions against wrong-doing;—these constitute his righteousness. Chapter I, paragraphs 1-10, is an amplification, according to KhungYing-ta and the editors of the imperial edition of the present dynasty, of the second chapter of Section i.. The lattei say that as all the chapters of Section i from the third onwards serve to elucidate chapter 2, so it is with this chapter and all that follow in this Section. The formation of the diagrams, and of their several lines, their indication of good fortune and bad, and the analogy between the processes of nature and the operations of divination, and other kindred subjects, are all touched on. ■ The order of the eight trigrams in paragraph 1, is Mien, tui, the appendixes. Chapter II. 11. Anciently, when Pao-hsi had come to the rule of all under heaven, looking up, he contemplated the brilliant forms exhibited in the sky, and looking down he surveyed the patterns shown on the earth. He contemplated the orna mental appearances of birds and beasts and the (different) suitabilities of the soil. Near at hand, in his own person, he found things for consideration, and the same at a distance, in things in general. On this he devised the eight trigrams, to show fully the It, Hn, sun, khan, kan, khwan. The three lines of each are emblematic—the first of heaven, the second of man, the third of earth. This is the most likely explanation of hsiang, ‘the em blems ' or ‘ similitudes' here. Why the maker—' sages ’—stopt at sixty-four figures, of six lines each, is a question that cannot he answered. Paragraph 2. Of course it was a great delusion to suppose that the changes of lines consequent on divination could be so con nected with the movements of life as to justify the characterising them as good or evil, or afford any guidance in the ordering of conduct. Paragraph 4, Who can tell ‘the requirements of the time’ amid the complexity of the phenomena of nature or the ever-varying events of human experience and history P The wiser men are,’ the more correct will be their judgments in such matters; but is there any reason for trusting to divination about them ? Paragraphs 5,6. It is difficult to say what is' the exact rule ’ intended here; unless it be that the factors in every movement shall act according to their proper nature. The Khang-hsi editors say‘ We see the good sometimes meeting with misfortune, and the bad with good fortune; but such is not the general rule.' ‘ The lessons that heaven and earth give forth’ are those concerning the method of their operation as stated in paragraph 7, and more fully w 6,7, 8 of Section i. What is said in paragraph xo is striking and important, and in aimony with the general strain of Confucian teaching;—as in the Great Learning, chapter 10, and many other places; but I fail to see its appropriateness in its present place in the Yi. ' CHAP. 2 , appendix hi. attributes of the spirit-like and intelligent (operations working- secretly), and to classify the qualities of the myriads of things. 12. He invented the making of nets of various kinds by knitting strings, both for hunting and fishing. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Li (the third trigram, and thirtieth, hexa gram). 13. On the death of Pao-hsi, there arose Shan- nang (in his place). He fashioned wood to form the share, and bent wood to make the plough- handle. The advantages of ploughing and weeding were then taught to all under heaven, The idea of this was taken, probably, from Yi (the forty- second hexagram), 14. He caused markets to be held at midday, thus bringing together all the people, and assem bling in one place all their wares. They made their exchanges and retired, every one having got what he wanted. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Shili Ho (the twenty-first hexagram). 15. After the death of Shan-nang, there arose Hwang Ti, Yao, and Shun. They carried through the (necessarily occurring) changes, so that the peo ple did (what was required of them) without being wearied; yea, they exerted such a spirit-like trans formation, that the people felt constrained to approve their (ordinances) as right. When a series of changes has run all its course, another change ensues. When it obtains free course, it will continue long. Hence it was that ‘these (sovereigns) were helped by Heaven; they had good fortune, and their every movement was advantageous.’ Hwang Ti, Yfto, and Shun (simply) wore their upper and THE APPENDIXES. lower garments (as patterns to the people), and good order was secured all under heaven. The idea of all this was taken, probably, from Kh\\t n and Khwan (the first and eighth trigrams, or the first and second hexagrams). 16. They hollowed out trees to form canoes; they cut others long and thin to make oars. Thus arose the benefit of canoes and oars for the help of those who had no means of intercourse with others. They could now reach the most distant parts, and all under heaven were benefited. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Hwin (the fifty-ninth hexagram). 17. They used oxen (in carts) and yoked horses ( to chariots), thus providing for the carriage of what was heavy, and for distant journeys,—thereby benefiting all under the sky. The idea of this was taken, probably, from S u i (the seventeenth hexagram). 1 3 . They made the (defence of the) double gates, and (the warning of) the clapper, as a preparation against the approach of marauding visitors. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Yii (the sixteenth hexagram). 19- They cut wood and fashioned it into pestles; they dug in the ground and formed mortars. Thus the myriads of the people received the benefit arising from the use of the pestle and mortar. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Hsiio ICwo (the sixty-second hexagram). 20. They bent wood by means of string so as to form bows, and sharpened wood so as to make arrows. This gave the benefit of bows and arrows, and served to produce everywhere a feeling of awe. CHAP. 2. APPENDIX III. ^5 The idea of this was taken, probably, from Khwei (the thirty-eighth hexagram). 21. In the highest antiquity they made their homes (in winter) in caves, and (in summer) dwelt in the open country. In subsequent ages, for these the sages substituted houses, with the ridge- beam above and the projecting roof below, as a provision against wind and rain. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Ta Zwang (the thirty- fourth hexagram). 22. When the ancients buried their dead, they covered the body thickly with pieces of wood, having laid it in the open country. They raised no mound over it, nor planted trees around; nor had they any fixed period for mourning. In subse quent ages the sages substituted for these practices the inner and outer coffins. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Ta Kwo (the twenty-eighth hexagram). 23. In the highest antiquity, government was carried on successfully by the use of knotted cords (to preserve the memory of things). In subse quent ages the sages substituted for these written characters and bonds. By means of these (the doings of) all the officers could be regulated, and (the affairs of) all the people accurately examined. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Kw&i (the forty-third hexagram). Chapter II, paragraphs 11-23, treats of the progress of civi lisation in China, and how the great men of antiquity who led the way in the various steps of that progress were guided by the Yt. Only five of these are mentionedthe first, Ffi-hsi, the beginning of whose reign, according to the least unlikely of the chronological accounts, must be placed in the 34th century b.c., while Shun's THE APPENDIXES. SECT. II, Chapter III. 24. Therefore what we call the Yi is (a collection of) emblematic lines. They are styled emblematic as being resemblances. reign ended in b.c. 2203. The time embraced in this chapter therefore is about twelve centuries and a half. But the writer gives his own opinion that the various discoveries and inventions mentioned were suggested to their authors by certain hexagrams of the Yt. The most commonly received view, however, is that Ffi-hsf had only the eight trigrams, and that the multipli cation of them to the 64 hexagrams was the work of king Wan, fully a thousand years later than Shun. This is the view of the editors of the imperial Yt. If it be contended that Fu-hst himself multiplied his trigrams, and gave their names to the resulting hexagrams, how could he have wrapped up in them the intimations of discoveries which were not made till many centuries after his death ? The statements in the chapter cannot be received as historical. It came from another hand, and not from Confucius himself. The writer or compiler gives the legends current about the various inventions of his time. The making of the trigrams is placed first of all to do honour to the Yi. The account of it is different from that given in paragraph 73 of the former Section, and we hear nothing of the Ho map or Lo writing. Paragraph 11. Pao-hsi here and in 13 is the same as Fft-hsi, As Pao is written here, there is no meaning in it; but another character Pbfto () is more common, and Phao-hsi would mean the inventor of the kitchen and cookery. This was the first step towards civilisation, and was appropriately followed by the hunting and fishing—both by means of nets—in paragraph 12. Paragraphs 13, r4 celebrate the work of Shan-nang, ‘the mar vellous or spirit-like husbandman.’ There was no metal about the primitive plough. The market for the exchange of commodities, without the use of coin, was an important advance. The invention of the robes, or of dress, mentioned in paragraph 15, would seem to show that previously men had been in a very rude state. The passage indicates, however, the courtesies and proprieties of social life, in which dress plays an important part, and which now began to be organised. The infant navigation in paragraph 16 was as little indebted to the use of metal, as the agriculture of 13. Paragraphs 17 and 18 show that in those primitive times there CHAP, 3. APPENDIX III. 25. What we call the Thwan (or king Wan’s explanations) are based on the significance (of each hexagram as a whole). 26. We call the lines (of the figures) Y&o from their being according to the movements taking place all under the sky. 27. In this way (we see) the rise of good fortune and evil, and the manifestation of repentance and regret. were already the practices of rapine and war. 1 The double gates ’ were those of the city wall, and of the enclosed suburb. The clapper may still be heard all over China. Bows and arrows, however, came rather later, as in 20. I suppose ‘the sages’ in paragraphs 21,22,23 refer generally to the great names mentioned in the previous chapters; nor can we define the distinction in the writer or compiler’s mind between 1 antiquity' and ‘ the highest antiquity,’ Compare what is said on the rise of the coffin in 22 with Mencius’ remarks on the same subject in Book III, ii, 5. 4. He would hardly have expressed himself as he did, if he had been familiar with this text. The invention of written characters is generally ascribed to Ffi-hsi. Paragraph 23 does not say so, but the inventor is said to have been a sage of a subsequent age to the time of ' high antiquity.’ That ‘ high antiquity ’ must stretch back very far. Chapter III, paragraphs 24-27, treats of the YI as made up of figurative diagrams, which again are composed of lines ever changing, in accordance with the phenomena of nature and human experience, while to the resulting figures their moral character and providential issues are appended by the sages. It may be regarded as an epitome of chapter 2 in Section i. Paragraph 24. It is observed by the editors of the imperial edition that a chapter should not begin with a ‘therefore;’ and they are inclined to agree with many critics who would enter this as the last paragraph of the preceding chapter. In that case it would be a summing-up of the concluding sentences of the different paragraphs, the truth and genuineness of which are deservedly suspected. The characters for ‘ therefore,’ however, are very loosely used in these Appendixes.—The lines, as they were intended by THE APPENDIXES. Chapter IV. 28. In the Yang trigrams (or those of the undivided line) there are more of the Yin lines, and in the Yin trigrams (or those of the divided line) there are more of the Yang lines. 29. What is the cause of this? It is because the Yang lines are odd (or made by one stroke), and the Yin lines are even (or made by two strokes). 30. What (method of) virtuous conduct is thus intimated? In the Yang trigrams we have one ruler, and two subjects—suggesting the way of the superior man. In the Yin trigrams we have two rulers, and one subject—suggesting the way of the small man. Fu-hsi, were emblematic; and they are still more so, as interpreted by the duke of Jfau. Meanings are drawn from the figures that resemble or illustrate principles in the subjects to which they are applied. Paragraph 25. The character rendered ‘the significance’ means materials, and is illustrated by reference to all the different materials out of which a house is composed. So there are half-a-dozen things about the diagrams, their lineal structure, emblematic in tention, their attributes, &c., out of which their interpretation is fashioned. Paragraph 26. E, g. an undivided line may appear in an odd place, which is right, or in an even place, which is wrong; and the case is the opposite with the divided lines. But what has this to do with the right or wrong of the events divined about? Chapter IV, paragraphs 28-30. Of the distinction of the trigrams into Yang and Yin. The trigrams that contain only one undivided line—Hn ( zzz khan ( gzjr: ), and kan (•—■ •—d—are called Yang. The undivided line is called ‘the lord’ in them. It is just the opposite with the Yin trigrams, in which there are two undivided lines, and one divided,—sun (==EE), If ( — — and tui r These together constitute the ‘ six children,’ or ‘ three CHAP. 5. APPENDIX III. Chapter V. 31. It is said in the Yl, ‘Full of auxious thoughts you go and come; (only) friends will follow you and think with you.’ The Master said: ‘In all (the processes taking place) under heaven, what is there of thinking ? what is there of anxious scheming ? They all come to the same (suc cessful) issue, though by different paths; there is one result, though there might be a hundred anxious schemes. What is there of thinking ? what is there of anxious scheming ? ’ 32. The sun goes and the moon comes; the moon goes and the sun comes;—the sun and moon thus take the place each of the other, and their shining is the result. The cold goes and the heat conies; the heat goes and the cold comesit is by this mutual succession of the cold and heat that the year is completed. That which goes becomes less and less, and that which comes waxes more and more;—it is by the influence on each other of this contraction and expansion that the advantages (of the different conditions) are produced. 33. When the looper coils itself up, it thereby straightens itself again; when worms and snakes sons ’ and ‘ three daughters ’ in the later arrangement of the tri- grams, ascribed to king Wan. Paragraph 29. Each part of the divided line counts as one; hence a yang trigram counts as 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 strokes, four of which are yin, while a yin trigrain counts as 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, only two of which are yang, But this is mere trifling. In explanation of paragraph 30 it is said that ‘ we have in the yang trigrams two (or more) subjects serving one ruler, and in the yin one subject serving two rulers, and two rulers striving together for the allegiance of one subject.’ This is ingenious, but fanciful; as indeed this distinction of the trigrams into a yang class and a y i n is a mere play of fancy. THE APPENDIXES. go into the state of hybernation, they thereby keep themselves alive. (So), when we minutely inves tigate the nature and reasons (of things), till we have entered into the inscrutable and spirit-like in them, we attain to the largest practical application of them; when that application becomes the quickest and readiest, and all personal restfulness is secured, our virtue is thereby exalted. 34. Going on beyond this, we reach a point which it is hardly possible to know. We have thoroughly comprehended the inscrutable and spirit-like, and know the processes of transformationthis is the fulness of virtue. 35. It is said in the Yi, * (The third line shows its subject) distressed before a rock, and trying to lay hold of thorns; entering into his palace and not seeing his wifethere will be evil.’ The Master said' If one be distressed by what need not distress him, his name is sure to be disgraced; if he lay hold on what he should not touch, his life is sure to be imperilled. In disgrace and danger, his death will (soon) come;—is it possible for him in such circum stances to see his wife ? ’ 36. It is said in the Yi, ‘ The duke with (his bow) shoots at the falcon on the top of the high wall; he hits it;—his every movement will be advantageous.’ The Master said;—‘ The falcon is a bird (of prey); the bow and arrow is a weapon (of war); the shooter is a man. The superior man keeps his weapon con cealed about his person, and waits for the proper time to move;—doing this, how should his move ment be other than successful ? There is nothing to fetter or embarrass his movement ;- and hence, when he comes forth, he succeeds in his object. chap. 5. appendix in. The language speaks of movement when the instru ment necessary to it is ready and perfect.’ 37. The Master said:- 1 The small man is not ashamed of what is not benevolent, nor does he fear to do what is not righteous. Without the prospect of gain he does not stimulate himself to what is good, nor does he correct himself without being moved. Self-correction, however, in what is small will make him careful in what would be of greater consequence;—and this is the happiness of the small man. It is said in the Yi, “His feet are in the stocks, and he is disabled in his toes:—there will be no (further) occasion for blame.” ’ 38. If acts of goodness be not accumulated, they are not sufficient to give its finish to ones name; if acts of evil be not accumulated, they are not sufficient to destroy one’s life. The small man thinks that small acts of goodness are of no benefit, and does not do them; and that small deeds of evil do no harm, and does not abstain from them. Hence his wickedness becomes great till it cannot be covered, and his guilt becomes great till it cannot be par doned. This is what the Yl says, ‘He wears the cangue and his ears are destroyedthere will be evil.’ 39. The Master said‘ He who keeps danger in mind is he who will rest safe in his seat; he who keeps ruin in mind is he who will preserve his interests secure; he who sets the danger of disorder before him is he who will maintain the state of order. There fore the superior man, when resting in safety, does not forget that danger may come; when in a state of security, he does not forget the possibility of ruin; and when all is in a state of order, he does not THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX III. forget that disorder may come. Thus his person is kept safe, and his states and all their clans can be preserved. This is according to what the Yl says, “ (Let him say), ‘ Shall I perish ? shall I perish ?’ (so shall this state be firm, as if) bound to a clump of bushy mulberry trees.” ’ • 40. The Master said:—Virtue small and office high; wisdom small and plans great; strength small and burden heavywhere such conditions exist, it is seldom that they do not end (in evil). As is said in the Yl, “The tripod’s feet are overthrown, and the ruler’s food is overturned. The body of him (who is thus indicated) is wet (with shame) :— there will be evil.” ’ 41. The Master saidDoes not he who knows the springs of things possess spirit-like wisdom? The superior man, in his intercourse with the high, uses no flattery, and, in his intercourse with the low, no coarse freedom:—does not this show that he knows the springs of things ? Those springs are the slight beginnings of movement, and the earliest indications of good fortune (or ill). The superior man sees them, and acts accordingly without waiting for (the delay of) a single day. As is said in the Yi, “He is firm as a rock, (and acts) without the delay of a single day. With firm goodness there will be good fortune.” Firm as a rock, how should he have to wait a single day to ensure his knowing (those springs and his course) ? The superior man knows the minute and the manifested; he knows what is weak, and what is strong:—he is a model to ten thousand.’ 42. The Master said‘ I may venture to say that the son of the Yen family had nearly attained (the I chap. 5. standard of perfection). If anything that he did was not good, he was sure to become conscious of that; and when he knew it, he did not do the thing again. As is said in the Yi, “(The first line shows its sub ject) returning from an error that has not led him far away. There is no occasion for repentance. There will be great good.’” 43. There is an intermingling of the genial in fluences of heaven and earth, and transformation in its various forms abundantly proceeds. There is an intercommunication of seed between male and female, and transformation in its living types pro ceeds. What is said in the Yi, ‘ Three individuals are walking together and one is made to disappear; there is (but) one man walking, and he gets his mate, tells us of the effort (in nature) at oneness (of operation). 44. The Master said:— c The superior man (in a high place) composes himself before he (tries to) move others; makes his mind restful and easy before he speaks; settles (the principles of) his intercourse with others before he seeks anything from them. The superior man cultivates these three things, and so is complete. If he try to move others while he is himself in unrest, the people will not (act) with him; if he speak while he is himself in a state of apprehension, the people will not respond to him; if without (certain principles of) intercommunica tion, he issue his requests, the people will not grant them. When there are none to accord with him, those who (work to) injure him will make their appearance. As is said in the Y 1 , “ (We see one) to whose advantage none will contribute, while some will seek to assail him. He observes no THE APPENDIXES. regular rule in the ordering of his heart :—there will be evil.’” Chapter V, paragraphs 31-44, gives the words of the duke of Aau on eleven different lines in the Text of the Yi, along with remarks of Confucius in farther illustration of them. But they seem also to be intended to bring forth more fully the meaning of certain previous utterances about the structure and scope of the Yi. Paragraphs 31-34 start from the fourth line of the 31st hexa gram, which would seem merely to require a steady and unvarying purpose in any one, in order to the full development of his influ ence. The editors of the imperial edition, however, make the whole a sequel of paragraph 5. But granted that there is no ‘ anxious scheming ’ in the processes of the natural world or in the phenomena of insect life, there is really no analogy to their pro ceedings in the course of the man who makes himself master of ‘ the nature and reasons of things,’ as described in 33 and 34. Nor are ‘the nature and reasons of things’ to be found in the Yi, as the writer believed they were. Such as it is, it requires immense thought to understand it, and when we have laid hold of it, there is nothing substantial in our grasp. The ‘virtue' predicated of such attainment is not so much moral excellence, as apprehension and the power and ability to invent, and to affect others. Paragraph 35. See on the third line of Khwan, the 47th hexagram. If we were to translate the explanations of the line after Confucius, we should put the first two statements hypotheti cally ; but the four that compose it seem to run on in the same way. They are all, I apprehend, hypothetical. Paragraph 36. See on the last line of ATeh, the 40th hexa gram. Paragraph 37. See on the first line of Shih Ho, the 21st hexa gram. The ‘self-correction in what is small’ implies of course that the small man has been ‘ awed.’ What is said about him here is true; but we hardly expect it in this place. Paragraph 38 should probably begin, like those before and after it, with ‘ The Master said.' The characters quoted from the Yi are again from the text of Shih Ho, on the last line. Paragraph 39, See on the fifth line of Phi, the 12th hexagram. Paragraph 40 gives Confucius’ views on the fourth line of Ting, the 50th hexagram. In paragraph 41 we are conducted to the 16th hexagram,-—the chap. 6 . APPENDIX III. Chapter VI. 45. The Master said‘ (The tri- grams) A 7 rien and Khwan may be regarded as the gate of the Y1.’ KK\\t n represents what is of the yang nature (bright and active); Khwan what is of the yin nature (shaded and inactive). These two unite according to their qualities, and there comes the embodiment of the result by the strong and weak (lines). In this way we have the phenomena of heaven and earth visibly exhibited, and can com prehend the operation of the spiritual intelligence. 46. The appellations and names (of the diagrams and lines) are various, but do not go beyond (what is to be ascribed to the operation of these two con ditions). When we examine the nature and style second line of it. The being ‘firm as a rock’ is understood to symbolise the state of ‘rest,’ the quiet self-possession out of which successful movement and action is understood to spring. In paragraph 42, ‘the son of the Yen family’ is Yen Hui, the favourite disciple of Confucius. The passage quoted from the Yt is that on the first line of Fla, the 24th hexagram. To paragraph 43, as to paragraph 38 ,1 would prefix the cha racters for ‘ The Master said.’ ‘ Male and female' is to be taken generally, and not confined to the individuals of the human pair. One Chinese writer says that in the transformations ascribed to heaven and earth, birds, fishes, animals, and plants are included, but from the ‘ transformation in its living types' plants are excluded, because in their generation there is nothing analogous to the emis sion and reception of seed. Other Chinese writers, however, are well enough acquainted with the sexual system of plants. It would seem to me that Confucius, if the paragraph were really his, intended only plants or the vegetable world in his reference to the operation of heaven and earth, and had all living tribes in view in his mention of male and female. The passage of the Yi referred to is on the third line of Sun, the 41st hexagram. The application of it is far-fetched. Paragraph 44. See on the fifth line of Yi, the 42nd hexa gram. the appendixes. (of the appended explanations), they seem to express the ideas of a decaying age. 47. The Yi exhibits the past, and (teaches us to) discriminate (the issues of) the future; it makes manifest what is minute, and brings to light what is obscure. (Then king Wan) opened (its symbols), and distinguished things in accordance with its names, so that all his words were correct and his explana tions decisive;—(the book) was now complete. 48. The appellations and names (of the diagrams and lines) are but small matters, but the classes of things comprehended under them are large. Their scope reaches far, and the explanations attached to them are elegant. The words are indirect, but to the point; the matters seem plainly set forth, but there is a secret principle in them. Their object is, in cases that are doubtful, to help the people in their conduct, and to make plain the recompenses of good and evil. The principal object, it is said, of chapter VI, paragraphs 45-48, is to set forth the views of king Wan and his son in the explana tions which they appended to the diagrams and lines; and in doing this the writer begins in 45, with Ffi-hsfs starting, in the formation of his eight trigrams, from the devising of the whole and divided lines, to represent the two primitive forms in nature. The two ‘ pure trigrams formed of these lines, unmixed, give rise to all the others, or rather the lines of which they are formed do so; and are thus compared to a gate by which the various diagrams enter to complete the system that is intended to represent the changing phenomena of nature and experience, The next sentence in the above version of paragraph 45 appears in Canon McClatchie’s translation of the Yi, as follows:—‘jT/rien is the membrum viiile, and Khwan is the pudendum muliebre (the sakti of •AJien), It is hardly possible, on reading such a version, to sup- piess the exclamation proh pudor! Can a single passage be adduced in support of it from among all the Chinese critics in the CHAP. 7. APPENDIX HI. Chapter VII. 49, Was it not in the middle period of antiquity that the Y1 began to flourish ? Was not he who made it familiar with anxiety and cala mity ? 50. Thetefore (the 10th diagram), Li, shows us the foundation of virtue; (the 15th), Hsien, its handle, (the 24th), Ffi, its root; (the 32nd), Hang, its solidity; (the 41st), Sun, its cultivation; (the 42nd), Yi, its abundance; (the 47th), Khwan, its exeicise of discrimination; (the 48th), 3ing, its field; and (the 57th), Sun, its regulation. 51. In Li we have the perfection of harmony; in Hsien, we have the giving honour to others, line of centuiies? I believe not. The ideas which it expresses are gratuitously and wantonly thrust into this text of the Yi. ‘ Khk n* and ‘Khwan’ are not spoken of thus. If the latter half of the paragraph be unintelligible, this interpretation of the former would make the whole disgusting. In paragraph 46 the writer passes from the work of Ffi-hst to that of king Wan and his son, and the composition of the written Yi is referred to ‘ a decaying age,’—the age, namely, of the tyrant .Wau. I hen king Wan and the duke of M u, it is said, deploring the degeneracy of their times and the enormities of the government, indicated, by their treatment of the ancient symbols, their sense of right and wrong, and the methods by which the prevailing evils might be rectified. Paragraphs 47 and 48 follow and expand the meaning of 45. The editors of the imperial edition say that the former sentence of 47 is the sequel of 45, and the latter of 46, bringing us finally to the explanations and decisions of king Wan, as the most im portant portion of the Yi iffl Hsf, moreover, observes that throughout the chapter, as well as in the chapters that follow, there must be many characters wanting in the text, while there are many also that are doubtful. This is specially the case with 48. Where the order of the characters has been disarranged merely, correction is easy; but where characters are evidently missing, attempts to fill the lacunae are merely guess-work. THE APPENDIXES. and the distinction thence arising; in Fh we have what is small (at first), but there is in it a (nice) discrimination of (the qualities of) things; in Hang we have a mixed experience, but without any weari ness; in Sun we have difficulty in the beginning and ease in the end; in Yi we have abundance of growth without any contrivance; in Khwan we have the pressure of extreme difficulty, ending in a free course; in 3 ing we have abiding in one’s place and at the same time removal (to meet the move ment of others); and in Sun we have the weighing of things (and action accordingly), but secretly and unobserved. 52. (The use of) Li appears in the harmony of the conduct; of Hsien, in the regulation of cere monies ; of Ffit, in self-knowledge; of Hang, in uni formity of virtue; of Sun, in keeping what is harmful at a distance; of Y i, in the promotion of what is advantageous; of Khwan, in the diminution of re sentments; of Sing, in the discrimination of what is righteous; and of Sun, in the doing of what is appropriate to time and to circumstances. Chapter VII, paragraphs 49-52, is occupied with nine hexa grams, as specially indicating how the superior man, or the ruler, should deal with a time of trouble and solicitude, specially by the cultivation of his own virtue. Not, we are told, that the same thing might not be learned from other diagrams, but these nine specially occurred to the writer, or, as many think, to Confucius, Paragraph 49 is important as agreeing in its testimony with 46. The Yi was made in middle-antiquity; that is, in the end of the Shang dynasty, and the rise of the Z&u; and the maker or makers had personal and public reasons for anxiety about the signs of the times. Paragraph 50 shows the particular phase of virtue in each of the nine hexagrams that are mentioned; 51, the marvellous character- chap. 8. APPENDIX III. Chapter VIII. 53. The Yi is a book which should not be let slip from the mind. Its method (of teach ing) is marked by the frequent changing (of its lines). They change and move without staying (in one place), flowing about into any one of the six places of the hexagram. They ascend and descend, ever inconstant. The strong and the weak lines change places, so that an invariable and compendious rule cannot be derived from them;—it must vary as their changes indicate. 54. The goings forth and comings in (of the lines) are according to rule and measure. (People) learn from them in external and internal affairs to stand in awe. 55. (The book), moreover, makes plain the nature of anxieties and calamities, and the causes of them. Though (its students) have neither master nor guardian, it is as if their parents drew near to them, 56. Beginning with taking note of its explanations, we reason out the principles to which they point. We thus find out that it does supply a constant and standard rule. But if there be not the proper men (to carry this out), the course cannot be pursued without them. istics of each phase; and 52, its use. The ‘therefore' with which paragraph 50 commences shows the process of thought by which the writer passed from the anxiety that possessed the mind of the author of the Yi to the use to be derived, in such circumstances, from the study of Li and the other hexagrams. Chapter VIII, paragraphs 53-56, describes the method of study ing the Yi as consisting very much in watching the changes that take place in the lines, and reflecting on the appended explanations; while, after all, much must depend on there being ‘ the proper men, THE APPENDIXES. Chapter IX. 57. The Yi is a book in which the form (of each diagram) is determined by the lines from the first to the last, which must be carefully observed. The six lines are mixed together, accord ing to the time (when they enter the figure) and their substance (as whole and divided). 58. There is difficulty in knowing (the significance of) the first line, while to know that of the topmost line is easy;—they form the beginning and the end (of the diagram). The explanation of the first line tasks the calculating (of the makers), but in the end they had (but) to complete this. 59. As to the variously-disposed intermediate lines with their diverse formations, for determining their qualities, and discriminating the right and wrong in them, we should be unprovided but for the explanations of them. 60. Yea, moreover, if we wish to know what is likely to be preserved and what to perish, what will be lucky and what will be unlucky, this may easily be known (from the explanations of the different lines). But if the wise will look at the explanations of the entire diagrams, their thoughts will embrace more than half of this knowledge. 61. The second and fourth lines are of the same There seems to be a contradiction between the statements in paragraphs 53 and 56 about the book supplying, and not sup plying, a standard rule; but the meaning, probably, is that while it does not give a rule generally applicable, it gives rules for par ticular cases, Ki Hsi says he does not understand 54, and thinks some cha racters must have been lost. 1 The six places of the hexagram’ in 53 are, literally, ‘the six empties,' The places are so called, be cause it is only a temporary possession of them, which is held by the fugitive lines, whether whole or divided. CHAP. 9. APPENDIX III. quality (as being in even places), but their positions (with respect to the fifth line) are different, and their value is not the same; but the second is the object of much commendation, and the fourth the subject of many apprehensions,—from its nearness (to that line). But for a line in a place of weakness it is not good to be far (from the occupant of the place of strength), and what its subject should desire in such a case is (merely) to be without blame. The advantage (here) is in (the second line) being in the central place. 62. The third and fifth lines are of the same quality, (as being in odd places), but their positions are different; and the (occupant of) the third meets with many misfortunes, while the occupant of the fifth achieves much merit:—this arises from one being in the noble position and the other in the mean. Are they occupied by the symbol of weak ness ? There will be peril. By that of strength ? There will be victory. Chapter IX, paragraphs 56-62, speaks of the hexagrams as made up of the different lines, and various things to be attended to in those lines to determine their meaning. Paragraph 57. The time or order in which the lines enter de termines of course the place and number of each m the figure. Their ‘ substance’ is their form, as whole or divided, being yang 0t Paragraph 58 belongs to the first and sixth lines, We are hardly prepared for the statement that ‘the maker or makers had so much difficulty in determining the meaning of the first line, course when they had fixed that and completed the fi f re ’ e *' plaining all the lines, it was easy for the student to follow their 6X Paragraph 8 6^ seems to tay that the work of the duke of Bu on each line was but an indicating in detail of the processes of his father's mind in explaining the whole figure. THE APPENDIXES. Chapter X. 63. The Yi is a book of wide com prehension and great scope, embracing everything. There are in it the way of heaven, the way of man, and the way of earth. It then takes (the lines representing) those three Powers, and doubles them till they amount to six. What these six lines show is simply this,—the way of the three Powers. 64. This way is marked by changes and move ments, and hence we have the imitative lines. Those lines are of different grades (in the trigrams), and hence we designate them from their component elements. These are mixed together, and elegant forms arise, When such forms are not in their appro priate places, the ideas of good fortune and bad are thus produced. The last two paragraphs mention several points important to be attended to in studying, more especially, the duke of Zau on the several lines. Three different views of the concluding statement,— ‘ are they occupied.’ &c.are given in the imperial edition, ‘ It be longs,’ says Wft Zang, ‘ to the fifth line;’ 'to the third line,' says Hft Ping-wan (also of the Yuan dynasty); while Plan Hsing-kwo (of the Thang dynasty) held that it belonged to both. The Khang-hst editors say that' by discriminating and combining these views, we get to the meaning of the text,’ I am unable to do so. Chapter X, paragraphs 63, 64, speaks of the great comprehen siveness of the Yi, its figures and explanations being applicable to the three Powers—heaven, earth, and man, With paragraph 63. compare paragraph 4, Appendix VI. In the trigram the upper line represents heaven, the middle line man, and the lowest earth. This paragraph and that other are the nearest approach I know to an attempt to account for the doubling of the number of lines, and stopping with the hexagram; but the doing so was entirely arbitrary. Zft Hsi says:—‘ The upper two characters belong to heaven, the middle two to man, and the lower two to earth,’ No words could be more express; and yet Canon McClatchie says (p. 354):—'The two upper strokes represent Heaven, or Thai- yi, the husband; the two middle strokes, Earth, his wife; and the CHAP. IX. appendix III. Chapter XI. 65. Was it not in the last age of Yin, when the virtue of Kin had reached its highest point, and during the troubles between king Wan and (the tyrant) Kin, that the (study of the Yi) began to flourish ? On this account the explana tions (in the book) express (a feeling of) anxious apprehension, (and teach) how peril may be turned into security, and easy carelessness is sure to meet with overthrow. The method in which these things come about is very comprehensive, and must be acknowledged in every sphere of things. If at the beginning there be a cautious apprehension as to the end, there will probably be no error or cause for blame. This is what is called the way of the Yi. two lower strokes, Man, their son; all being animated by the same Divine Reason (tao) or Supreme God (Chih Shan),' This note shows how one error, or misunderstanding of the Chinese original, draws other errors with it, The character, tao in the paragraph has not at all the sense of reason, human or divine, but its primary and ordinary signification of the path or course. As Lft Bi (Han dynasty) says' In the way of heaven there are the changes of day and night, sun and moon; in that of earth, those of hardness and softness, dryness and moisture; in that of man, those of action and rest, of movement and stillness, of good fortune and bad, of good and evil,’ < The imitative lines ’ in the translation of 64, is simply ‘ the Yfi0 ’ in the Chinese text, which I have rendered according to the account of them in paragraph 8, et al. Their different grades are their position as high or low in the figures (paragraph 1, Section i), and their 'component elements,’ literally ‘their substance, or thing- nature,' is their structure as being yang or yin, according to the use of wuh in paragraphs 57, 59, et al. A yang line in an even place, or a yin line in an odd, is not in its appropriate place, and gives an indication of what is bad. Chapter XI, paragraph 65. P. Regis observes on this chapter < 1 do not hesitate to say that there is found nowhere in the whole 404 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. II. - 1 Chapter XII. 66. (The hexagram) Kh\\t n repre sents the strongest of all under the sky. Through this quality its operations are always manifested with ease, for it knows where there would be peril and embarrassment. (The hexagram) Khwan represents the most docile of all under the sky. A Through this quality its operations are always mani fested with the promptest decision, for it knows where there would be obstruction. 67. (The sages, who are thus represented, and who made the Y i,) were able to rejoice in heart (in the absolute truth of things), and were able (also) to weigh carefully all matters that could occasion anxiety; (thus) they fixed the good and bad fortune j (of all things) under the sky, and could accomplish the things requiring strenuous efforts. i 68, Therefore amid the changes and transforma tions (taking place in heaven and earth), and the words and deeds of men, events that are to be fortunate have their happy omens. (The sages) knew the definite principles underlying the prog nostications of the former class, and the future of Yi a passage which affords more light for the explanation of the book.' Paragraph 49 told us that 1 the study of the Yi flourished in the middle period of antiquity, and that the author of it was familiar with anxiety and troubles.’ That information becomes here more particular. The Yi, existing when this Appendix was written, was made in the closing period of the Yin dynasty, and the making of it was somehow connected with the attempts of the tyrant Afau against king Wan. We are not told expressly that the book was 4 written, in part at least, by king Wan; but the tradition to that effect derives a certain amount of support from what is said here. 4 The general object of the author is also stated clearly enough,— to inculcate a cautious and reverent administration of affairs, never forgetful of the uncertainties of life and fortune. CHAP. 12. APPENDIX III. 405 those of the latter, (now to be) ascertained by divination. 69. The places of heaven and earth (in the dia grams) having been determined, the sages were able (by means of the Yl) to carry out and complete their ability. (In this way even) the common people were able to share with them in (deciding about) the counsels of men and the counsels of spiritual beings. 70. The eight trigrams communicate their infor mation by their emblematic figures. The explana tions appended to the lines and the completed figures tell how the contemplation of them affected (the makers). The strong and the weak lines appear mixed in them, and (thus) the good and the evil (which they indicate) can be seen. 71. The changes and movements (which take place in the manipulation of the stalks and the formation of the diagrams) speak as from the stand point of what is advantageous. The (intimations of) good and evil vary according to the place and nature (of the lines), Thus they may indicate a mutual influence (in any two of them) of love or hatred, and good or evil is the result; or that mutual influence may be affected by the nearness of the lines to, or their distance from, each other, and then repentance or regret is the result; or the influence may be that of truth or of hypocrisy, and then the result is what is advantageous, or what is injurious. In all these relations of the (lines in the) Y1, if two are near and do not blend harmoniously, there may be (all these results),—evil, or what is injurious, or occasion for repentance and regret. 72. The language of him who is meditating a 40 6 THE APPENDIXES. SECT, II. revolt (from the right) betrays his inward shame; that of him whose inward heart doubts about it diverges to other topics. The words of a good man are few; those of a coarse man are many. The words of one who slanders what is good are un- Chapter XII, paragraphs 66-72, is generally divided into three sections;—the first, embracing 66-68, and treating of the sages, the makers of the Yi, as themselves independent of it, knowing all that it enables us to know, and able to accomplish all that it en ables us to accomplish; the second, embracing 69-71, and telling how the sages formed the Yi, and made all men, by means of it, partakers of their now unlimited knowledge and power; the third, comprised in paragraph 72, and saying, if it be genuine and in its proper place, that the ordinary speech of men is as mysterious and indicative of what is in them, as the explanations of the Yi are, when we consider who were its authors. ‘The sages,’ who are the subject of 65-68, are not mentioned in the text; but 67 makes it plain that the subject must be some per sonal being or beings. Neither jST/fcien nor Khwan can ‘ rejoice in heart, and weigh carefully matters occasioning anxiety.’ The com mentators generally interpolate ‘ the sages; ’ even Ying-ta of the Thang dynasty, who does not introduce the sages in his exposition, yet makes the subject to be ‘ the disposer and nourisher of all things.’ He gets to his view by an unnatural interpretation of two characters in 67, which are now thrown out of the text by all critics as not genuine. That ‘the sages ’ is really the subject in the mind of the writer appears from the express mention of them in 69, when also ‘heaven and earth’ take the place of JMien and Khwan. It is absurd, not to say blasphemous, to assume that the sages who made the Yi had the knowledge and ability here ascribed to them; but the theory of the Yi as containing a scheme for the discovery of the future necessitated the ascribing such attri butes to them. Compare with the whole Section, and especially with paragraph 68, what is said in ‘The Doctrine of the Mean,’ chapter 24. The first Section shows how the sages were themselves indepen dent of the Yi, and had no need of it; the second goes on to tell how they devised and constructed it, to make all men equal to themselves in a knowledge of phenomena and human events, and of their indications of, and issues in, the future. Summing up its chap. 12. APPENDIX III. substantial; those of him who is losing what he ought to keep are crooked. lessons, the editors of the imperial edition say, ‘ There is no passage in the Appendix more full and clear than this on the five points in regard to the lines which the student of the Yi has to attend to. Those points are:—their time, position, quality, mutual nearness, and responsive relation. It is by a consideration of the two latter points, moreover, that he must form his judgment on their appro priateness or inappropriateness in the three others.’ Paragraph 72 has really no connexion with the rest of the chapter. I have stated above how the critics attempt to make out such a connexion; but I agree myself with P. Regis, who appends to his version of the paragraph this note 1 Quae sententiae qui- dem sapiunt doctrinam Confucianam, at non ordinem, utpote cum praecedentibus minime cohaerentes, sed omnino ab iis abscissae avulsaeque.' appendix IV. APPENDIX IV. Supplementary to the TInvan and Yfio on the first and second Hexagrams, and showing how they may be interpreted of man’s nature and doings. Section I. Kmm. Chapter I. 1. What is called (under AVrien) ‘the great and originating ’ is (in man) the first and chief quality of goodness; what is called ‘ the penetrating’ is the assemblage of excellences; what is called ' the advantageous ’ is the harmony of all that is right; and what is called ‘ the correct and firm ’ is the faculty of action. 2, The superior man, embodying benevolence, is fit to preside over men; presenting the assemblage of excellences, he is fit to show in himself the union of all propriety; benefiting (all) creatures, he is fit to exhibit the harmony of all that is right; correct and firm, he is fit to manage (all) affairs. 3. The fact that the superior man practises these four virtues justifies the application to him of the words—' Kim n represents what is great and origin ating, penetrating, advantageous, correct and firm.’ The tide of this Appendix is in Chinese the Win Yen K 'wan, 1 1 he Record of Win Yen;’ and according to the analogy of the titles of the three Appendixes that follow, Win should per form the part of a verb and Yen that of a substantive. So the characters are usually taken, and to Win is given the meaning of ' Explaining (Shih)and to Yen that of'Words or Sentences,' meaning the Thwan of king Win, and the Yfio of the duke of Aau on the first two hexagrams. The document treats of these, CHAP. Chapter II. 4. What is the meaning of the words under the first line undivided, ‘ The dragon lies hid (in the deep)it is not the time for active doing ? ’ The Master said:—‘ There he is, with the powers of the dragon, and yet lying hid. The influence of the world would make no change in him; he would do nothing (merely) to secure his fame. He can live, withdrawn from the world, without regret; he can experience disapproval without trouble of mind. Rejoicing (in opportunity), he carries his principles and of no others. ‘ It shows the amount and depth of meaning in them,' says ATi Hsi, 'and the other hexagrams may be treated after the analogy supplied here.’ Confucius, it is said by others, died before he was able to carry out the plan which he had formed. But, as I have shown in the Introduction (pp. 28-30), it is more than doubtful whether we have in this Appendix anything at all directly from the sage. Chapter I, paragraphs 1-3, shows how the attributes of Kh ien, as explained by king W&n, are to be understood of the constituent principles of human nature. What is remarkable is, that we find paragraphs 1, 2, witli very little variation, in one of the narra tives of the Bo Iran, as having been spoken by a marchioness- dowager of LCl in ii.c. 564, several years before Confucius was born. One so familiar as M Hsi was with all the classical literature of his country could not be ignorant of this. His solution of the questions arising from it is, that anciently there was this explana tion of the characters of king WUn; that it was employed by Shu Xiang (of LA), and that Confucius also availed himself of it; while the chronicler used, as he does below, the phraseology of • The Master said,' to distinguish the real words of Confucius from such ancient sayings. But who was this chronicler? No one can tell. The legitimate conclusion from Xfi’s criticism is this, that so much of this Appendix as is preceded by ‘The Master said is from Confucius so much and no more. The ascription in paragraph 3 of ‘ the four virtues ’ to the supe rior or normal man, man in his best estate, and yet inferior to 1 1 e sagely man,' is Confucian, -after the style of the teaching of the Master in the Analects. 4io THE APPENDIXES. SECT. r. into action; sorrowing (for want of opportunity), he keeps with them in retirement. Yes, he is not to be torn from his root (in himself).’ This is ‘the dragon lying hid.' 5. What is the meaning of the words under the second line, ‘The dragon shows himself and is in the field;—it will be advantageous to see the great man ? ’ The Master said 1 There he is, with the dragon’s powers, and occupying exactly the central place. He is sincere (even) in his ordinary words, and earnest in his ordinary conduct. Guarding against depravity, he preserves his sincerity. His goodness is recognised in the world, but he does not boast of it. His virtue is extensively displayed, and transformation ensues. The language of the Yi, “ The dragon shows himself and is in the field;—it will be advantageous to see the great man,\" refers to a ruler’s virtue.’ 6. What is the meaning of the words under the third line, 1 The superior man is active and vigilant all the day, and in the evening (still) careful and apprehensive;—the position is dangerous, but there will be no mistake ?’ The Master saidThe supe rior man advances in virtue, and cultivates all the sphere of his duty. His leal-hearted ness and good faith are the way by which he advances in virtue. His attention to his words and establishing his sin cerity are the way by which he occupies in his sphere. He knows the utmost point to be reached, and reaches it, thus showing himself in accord with the first springs (of things); he knows the end to be rested in, and rests in it, thus preserving his righte ousness in accordance with that end. Therefore he occupies a high position without pride, and a low chap. 2. APPENDIX IV. 411 position without anxiety. Thus it is that, being active and vigilant, and careful (also) and apprehen sive as the time requires, though his position be perilous, he will make no mistake.’ 7. What is the meaning of the words under the fourth line, ‘He is as if he were leaping up, (but still) is in the deep;—there will be no mistake ? ’ The Master said:—‘He finds no permanent place either above or below, but he does not commit the error (of advancing). He may advance or recede;— there is no permanent place for him: but he does not leave his fellows. The superior man, advancing in virtue and cultivating the sphere of his duty, yet wishes (to advance only) at the (proper) time, and therefore there is no mistake.’ 8. What is the meaning of the words under the fifth line, 1 The dragon is on the wing in the sky;— it will be advantageous to see the great man ? ’ The Master said:—-‘Notes of the same key respond to one another; creatures of the same nature seek one another; water flows towards the place that is (low and) damp; fire rises up towards what is dry; clouds follow the dragon, and winds follow the tiger (so) the sage makes his appearance, and all men look to him. Things that draw their origin from heaven move towards what is above; things that draw their origin from the earth cleave to what is belowso does everything follow its kind.’ 9. What is the meaning of the words under the topmost line, ‘The dragon exceeds the proper limitsthere will be occasion for repentance ? ’ The Master said‘ The position is noble, but it is not that of office; (its occupant) dwells on high, but he has no people (to rule); and the men of talent THE APPENDIXES. and virtue in the positions below will give him no aid;—should he move in such a case, there will be occasion for repentance.’ In chapter II, paragraphs 4-9, Confucius is introduced, ex plaining, with considerable amplification, what is said by the duke of ITui under the several lines of the hexagram. 1 The dragon ’ becomes the symbol of 1 the superior man; ’ and of 1 the great man/ or the sage upon the throne. The language approaches at times to the magniloquence of Mencius, while in paragraph 8 the voice hardly seems to be that of the sage at all. With paragraph 5, compare chapters 8 and 14 of ‘the Doc trine of the Mean/ agreeing much in language anti sentiment with what we have here. The line, a strong or undivided line, and therefore yang, is said to be ‘exactly in the central place;' but the line is in the second, an even place, that proper to a yin line; and in other passages this might be explained in an unfavourable way, The Chinese character Eng has the meaning given to it, now of ‘exact/ and now of 'correct/ the latter being always favourably interpreted. Paragraph 8, The fifth is almost always the place of honour and authority in the hexagram, and therefore ‘ the great man ’ here con tinues to he the great man, ‘ the sage.' The argument is that as things of the same kind respond to and seek one another, so is it with the sage and ordinary man. They are of the same kind, though far apart; and when a sage appears, all other men look to him with admiration and hope. The continuity of the illustrations, however, is broken by the introduction of the dragon and clouds, and the tiger and wind. Are these of the same kind? An list says he does not think that the real dragon and real tiger are intended; but he does not tell us how he understood the terms. 3 ai A 7 /ing (early in the Ming dynasty) says:.‘ The dragon feels the influence of the clouds surcharged with rain, and rises from the deep, and when the tiger feels the approach of the cold winds he roars. Thus when the dragon rises, the clouds are sun; to collect; and when the tiger screams, the winds follow; ’ but all this does not help us to appreciate any better the words of the text. And the concluding illustration is nearly as foreign to our way of conceiving things. By 1 tilings that draw their origin from heaven ’ all animals •—moving creatures—are intended; and by those that draw their origin from the earth are intended all plants,—things that stand and CHAP. 3. appendix IV. 413.

Chapter V, paragraphs 24-29. The author here, leaving the treatise on the symbolism of the Y£o, turns to that on the T hwan, or expositions of king Wan, and amplifies it, not quoting from it, however, so fully and exactly, as he has done in the previous chapters from the Yao. Paragraphs 24 and 25 are based on the statement of the signi ficance of the Thwan under .Oien, and not on the treatise on the symbolism. The originating power cannot be separated from that of penetration and development. The latter issues from theformer 41 6 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. I. Chapter VI. 30. In the superior man his conduct is (the fruit of) his perfected virtue, which might be seen therefore in his daily course; but the force of that phrase, ‘lying hid,’ requires him to keep re tired, and not yet show himself, nor proceed to the full development of his course. While this is the case, the superior man (knows that) it is not the time for active doing. 31. The superior man learns and accumulates the results of his learning; puts questions, and discrimi nates among those results; dwells magnanimously and unambitiously in what he has attained to; and carries it into practice with benevolence. What the Yi says, ‘The dragon appears in the fieldit will be advantageous to meet with the great man/ has reference to the virtuous qualities of a ruler (as thus described). 32. In the third line there is a twofold (symbol of) strength, but (the position) is not central. (Its as the summer follows on the spring, according to an illustration of M Hsf. ‘ The advantageousness ’ and ‘ firm correctness,’ he compares also to the autumn and winter, saying that the i^ien power in its essence, as it is in itself, is best described by these two latter characteristics, while the two former describe it in its opera tion. It is thus that he tries to give his readers an idea of what he understood by 'nature and feelings’ in 25. But this chapter treats of the KKm power in nature rather than in humanity. Confining our view to the power so operating, we cannot say that the descrip tion of it in 26 and 27 is magniloquent or hyperbolical. Paragraph 28 returns to the explanations of the lines of the hexagram by the duke of Jfau, which exhibit the power in different positions and relations, bringing out all its significance; and then 29 confines us to the fifth line, in which we have its ideal. The spheres of nature and of men seem to be in the view of the author, and therefore I introduce 'the great man/ as the subject, after the example of the best critics. Like the clouds and the rain to the thirsty earth, so is the rule of the sage to expectant humanity. chap. 6 . APPENDIX IV. 4*7 occupant) is not in heaven above, nor is he in the field beneath. Therefore there must be active vigi lance and cautious apprehension as the time requires; and though (the position be) perilous, there will be no mistake. 33. In the fourth line there is (the symbol of) strength, but (the position) is not central. (Its j occupant) is not in heaven above, nor is he in the field beneath, nor is he in the place of man inter mediate. Hence he is in perplexity; and being so, he has doubts about what should be his movements, and so will give no occasion for blame. 34. The great man is he who is in harmony, in . his attributes, with heaven and earth; in his bright ness, with the sun and moon; in his orderly pro- j cedure, with the four seasons; and in his relation to what is fortunate and what is calamitous, in har mony with the spirit-like operations (of Providence). He may precede Heaven, and Heaven will not act in opposition to him; he may follow Heaven, but will act (only) as Heaven at the time would do. If Heaven will not act in opposition to him, how much i less will men! how much less will the spirit-like operation (of Providence)! 35. The force of that phrase-'exceeding the proper limits’-indicates the knowing to advance but not to retire; to maintain but not to let perish; to get but not to lose. ) 36.

(What Is indicated by) Khwan is most gentle and weak, but, when put in motion, is object being to show how reasonable are the decisions and lessons of the duke of ifau. The subject of paragraph 30 has the virtue; but his position in the lowest place shows that his time is not yet come.' In paragraph 31 we have the superior man developing, by means of the processes described, into 1 the great man,’ with the attributes of a ruler, the appearance of whom is a blessing to men. The twofold symbol of strength in paragraph 32 is the yang or undivided line in the third place (odd) proper to it. There will be no mistake, because the subject of the line, in the exercise of his caution, will abstain from any forward movement. According to paragraph 63 of last Appendix, Section ii, both the third and fourth lines in the hexagram belong to man, and are intermediate between those of heaven and those of earth. Killing Ying-ti, to get over the difficulty in what is said on the fourth line, says that, as a matter of fact and locally, man is nearer earth than heaven, and is aptly represented therefore by the third line and not by the fourth ;~I prefer to point out the inconsistency, and leave it. The subject of this fourth line will move very cautiously, and so escape blame, The eulogium of‘the great man' in paragraph 34 cannot fail to recall to the classical scholar the thirty-first and other chapters of‘the Doctrine of the Mean,’ where the sage is described as ‘ The Equal of Heaven.’ In one sentence here he is spoken of as sometimes taking precedence of Heaven, which then does not act in opposi tion to him! I do not know of any statement about the sage, coming without doubt from Confucius, that is so extravagant as this, It is difficult—in fact impossible—to say from the Yi itself, what we are to understand by the kwei shan, which I have translated here by ‘ the spirit-like operations (of Providence).’ The compound denomination does not often occur in the book. In Appendix III, Section i, 21, kwei is the animaand shan the animus; and in paragraph 50,1 have translated the terms by ‘ the contracting and expanding operations.' In Appendix I, page 226 and page 259, the name is used as in the present text. That second instance and this CHAP.. hard and strong; it is most still, but is able to give every definite form. 2. ‘ By following, it obtains its (proper) lord,’ and pursues its regular (course). 3. It contains all things in itself, and its trans forming (power) is glorious. 4. Yes, what docility marks the way of Khwan! It receives the influences of heaven, and acts at the proper time. Chapter II. 5. The family that accumulates good ness is sure to have superabundant happiness, and the family that accumulates evil is sure to have superabundant misery. The murder of a ruler by paragraph were evidently constructed, the one on the model of the other. I think it likely that the breath or air, M, became the name with the earliest Chinese for their first concept of spirit; then the breath inspired or inhaled was called kwei, and became the name for the grosser part of the spirit, returning to the earth; and shan, the breath exhaled or expired, the name for the subtler and intellec tual spirit, ascending to a state of activity and enjoyment. The explanations of the terms in the R Ya and other dictionaries seem to justify this view. The combination kwei shan is sometimes best translated by ‘spiritual beings.’ The school of the Sung philosophy understand by it—the contracting and expanding of the primary matter, or that matter conceived of in two forms or with two opposite qualities. J/mng-jze says here that ‘Heaven and earth are another name for tao, and kwei shan another name fot “ the vestiges of making and transformation;’ and that the sage being in harmony with the tao or practical reason of the universe, how can men or the kwei sbiin be contrary to him? Whatever be thought of the Sung speculations and theories, I think that a trans lator ought to give an indication of the primary meaning of the name kwei shan. , Paragraphs 35 and 36 suggest the description of Confucius by Mencius, V, ii, 1, 5 , as the one among the sages who was most governed by the consideration of time, doing continually what the circumstances of the time required. E 6 2 THE APPENDIXES. his minister, or of his father by a son, is not the result of the events of one morning or one evening. The causes of it have gradually accumulated,— through the absence of early discrimination. The words of the Yl, ‘He treads on the hoar-frost; the strong ice will come (by and by),’ show the natural (issue and growth of things). 6. ‘Straight 1 indicates the correctness (of the internal principle), and ‘square/ the righteousness (of the external act). The superior man, (thus represented), by his self-reverence maintains the inward (correctness), and in righteousness adjusts his external acts. His reverence and righteousness being (thus) established, his virtues are not solitary instances or of a single class. ‘Straight, square, and great, working his operations, without repeated efforts, in every respect advantageous—this shows how (such a one) has no doubts as to what he does, 7. Although (the subject of) this divided line has excellent qualities, he (does not display them, but) keeps them under restraint. ‘ If he engage with them in the service of the king, and be successful, he will not claim that success for himself/—this is the way of the earth, of a wife, of a minister. The way of the earth is—‘ not to claim the merit of achievement/ but on behalf (of heaven) to bring things to their proper issue. 8. Through the changes and transformations pro duced by heaven and earth, plants and trees grow luxuriantly. If (the reciprocal influence of) heaven and earth were shut up and restrained, we should have (a state that might suggest to us) the case of men of virtue and ability lying in obscurity. The words of the Yl, ‘A sack tied up:—there will be CHAP. 2. appendix IV. no ground for blame or for praise/ are in reality a lesson of caution. 9. The superior man (emblemed here) by the ‘yellow’ and correct (colour), is possessed of com prehension and discrimination. He occupies the correct position (of supremacy), but (that emblem) is on (the lower part of) his person. His excellence is in the centre (of his being), but it diffuses a complacency over his four limbs, and is manifested in his (conduct of) affairs -.—this is the perfection of excellence. 10. (The subject of) the yin (or divided line) thinking himself equal to the (subject of the) yang, or undivided line, there is sure to be ‘ a contest.’ As if indignant at there being no acknowledgment of the (superiority of the subject of the) yang line, (the text) uses the term ‘ dragons.’ But still the (subject of neither line) can leave his class, and hence we have ‘ the blood ’ mentioned. The men tion of that as being (both) ‘azure and yellow’ indicates the mixture of heaven and earth. Hea ven’s (colour) is azure and earth’s is yellow. The hexagram Kh wan is dealt with in Section ii, and much more briefly than jOien in Section i. Much less distinct, more over, is the attempt in it to show how the attributes of the hexagram are to be understood of the principles of human nature. The most important portion of the Section, perhaps, is paragraph .<5, the first of chapter II, and I have spoken of it in the Introduction, pages 47 and 48. A P P E N D I X V. Treatise of Remarks on the Trigrams. Chapter I. i. Anciently, when the sages made the Yi, in order to give mysterious assistance to the spiritual Intelligences, they produced (the rules for the use of) the divining plant. 2. The number 3 was assigned to heaven, 2 to earth, and from these came the (other) numbers. 3. They contemplated the changes in the divided and undivided lines (by the process of manipulating the stalks), and formed the trigrams; from the movements that took place in the strong and weak lines, they produced (their teaching about) the sepa rate lines, There ensued a harmonious conformity to the course (of duty) and to virtue, with a dis crimination of what was right (in each particular case). They (thus) made an exhaustive discrimina tion of what was right, and effected the complete development of (every) nature, till they arrived (in the Yi) at what was appointed for it (by Heaven). Chapter I, paragraphs 1-3, treats of the rise of the scheme of the Yi from the wonderful qualities of the divining plant, the use of certain numbers, and the formation of the lineal figures. P. Regis translates paragraph x by—' The ancient (sagos), the most excellent men, were the authors of the Yt-king, in making which they were assisted by an intelligent spirit, who for their help produced the plant called Shih.’ But the text will not admit of this version, nor have I found the view given in it in any Chinese writer. It is difficult to make up one’s mind whether to translate—' the sage,' or * the sages.’ Khung Ying-ta contends that the writer had Ffi-hsi and him alone in his CHAP, 2. appendix v. Chapter II. 4. Anciently, when the sages made the YI, it was with the design that (its figures) should be in conformity with the principles underlying the natures (of men and things), and the ordinances (for them) appointed (by Heaven). With this view they exhibited (in them) the way of heaven, calling (the lines) yin and yang; thewayof earth, calling (them) the weak (or soft) and the strong (or hard); and the way of men, under the names of benevolence mind. To me it seems otherwise. Fu-hst, if we accept the testi mony of universal Chinese consent, made the eight trigrams; but he did not make the Yt, which, by the same consent, was the pro duction of king Wiin and his son. The text would seem to say that the sages ‘produced’ the plant, but this is so extravagant that the view indicated in my supplementary clause appears in all the best commentators. So understood, the YI maybe said to ‘give mysterious assistance to the spiritual Intelligences,’ or, if we take that name as singular (according to the analogy of chapter 6), to the Divine Being in affording a revelation of His will, as in paragraph 3, We may well say that it is a pity the revelation should be so enigmatical; but the author, it must be remembered, is writing from his own stand point. Wan and his son, as I have endeavoured to show in the Introduction, merely wished to convey, under the style and veil of divination, their moral and political lessons. On paragraph 2 it is said that heaven is round; and as the cir cumference of a circle is three times its diameter, hence 3 is the number of heaven. Again, earth is square, and as the circumference of a square is four times its length or breadth, or it consists of two pairs of equal sides, hence 2 is the number of earth. The concluding statement about ‘ the other numbers ’ is under stood of the manipulation of the divining stalks, as in Appendix III, i ( 51. That manipulation, thrice repeated, might leave three stalks each time, and 3 x 3=9; or 2, being in the same way in all-6; or twice 3 and once 2=8; or twice 2 and once 3=7. These are the numbers of the 4 binary symbols, employed in forming the new the old yang,=9; the young yin, =8; THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX Y. chap. 3. and righteousness. Each (trigram) embraced (those) three Powers; and, being repeated, its full form con sisted of six lines. A distinction was made of (the places assigned) to the yin and yang lines, which were variously occupied, now by the strong and now by the weak forms, and thus the figure (of each hexa gram) was completed. Chapter III. 5. (The symbols of) heaven and earth received their determinate positions; (those for) mountains and collections of water interchanged their influences; (those for) thunder and wind excited each other the more; and (those for) water and fire did each other no harm. (Then) among these eight symbols there was a mutual communication. 6. The numbering of the past is a natural pro cess ; the knowledge of the coming is anticipation. Therefore in the Yi we have (both) anticipation (and the natural process). Chapter II. The top line in each trigram thus belongs to the category of heaven; the bottom line to that of earth; and the middle line to that of man. The odd places should be occupied, ‘-correctly,’ by the undivided lines; and the even by the divided. The trigram being increased to the hexagram, lines 5 and 6 were assigned to heaven; 1 and 2 to earth; and 3 and 4 to man. 5 is the yang characteristic of heaven, and 6 the yin; so 1 and z in regard to earth; while 3 represents the benevolence of man, and 4 his righteousness., But all this is merely the play of fancy, and confuses the mind of the student. Chapter III, paragraphs 5 and 6, is understood, though not very clearly, by referring to the circular arrangement of the trigrams according to Ffi-hsi, as shown in Figure 2, of Plate III. Para graph 5 refers to the correlation of JSfAien and Khw&n, R&n and Tui, Kiri and Sun, Khan and Lf. Paragraph 6 is less easy oF apprehension. Starting in the same figure from Khltn and num bering on the left we come to ifan by a natural process. Then CHAP. 5, Chapter IV. 7. Thunder serves to put things in motion; wind to scatter (the genial seeds of) them; rain to moisten them ; the sun to warm them; (what is symbolised by) Kan, to arrest (and keep them in their places); (by) Tui, to give them joyful course; (by) Kh ien, to rule them; and by Khwan, to store them up. Chapter V. 8. God comes forth in Afan (to His producing work); He brings (His processes) into full and equal action in Sun; they are manifested to one another in Ll; the greatest service is done for Him in Khwan; He rejoices in Tui; He struggles in AfAien; He is comforted and enters into rest in Khan; and He completes (the work of the year) in Kan, 9. All things are made to issue forth in Afan, which is placed at the east, (The processes of pro duction) are brought into full and equal action in Sun, which is placed at the south-east. The being brought into full and equal action refers to the purity and equal arrangement of all things. Li gives the idea of brightness. All things are now made mani- we turn back, and numbering on the right, from Sun, we come by a backward process to Khwan. The same process is illustrated on a large scale by the circular arrangement of the 64 hexagrams in Plate I. But what the scope of the paragraph is I cannot tell, and am tempted to say of it, as P. Regis does, ‘ Haec observatio prorsus inanis est.’ In chapter IV we have the same circular arrangement of the trigrams, though they are named in a different order; the last first and the first last. The first four are mentioned by their elemental names; the last four by the names of their lineal figures, No special significance is attached to this. If it ever had any, it has been lost. THE APPENDIXES. chap. g. fest to one another. 11 is the trigram of the south. The sages turn their faces to the south when they give audience to all under the sky, administering government towards the region of brightness:—the idea in this procedure was taken from this. Kh wan denotes the earth, (and is placed at the south-west). All things receive from it their fullest nourishment, and hence it is said, 1 The greatest service is done for Him in Khwan.’ Tui corresponds (to the west) and to the autumn,—the season in which all things rejoice. Hence it is said, ‘He rejoices in Tui.’ He struggles in Kk\\t n, which is the trigram of the north-west. The idea is that there the inactive and active conditions beat against each other. Khan denotes water. It is the trigram of the exact north—the trigram of comfort and rest, what all things are tending to. Hence it is said, ‘ He is com forted and enters into rest in Khan. Kan is the trigram of the north-east. In it all things bring to a full end the issues of the past (year), and prepare the commencement of the next. Hence it is said, ‘ He completes (the work of the year) in Kan.’ Chapter V, paragraphs 8 and 9, sets forth the operations of nature in the various seasons, as being really the operations of God, who is named Ti, ‘the Lord and Ruler of Heaven,’ Those opera tions are represented in the progress by the seasons of the year, as denoted by the trigrams, according to the arrangement of them by king Wan, as shown also in Plate III, Figure 2. ! The greatest service.is done for Ti in Khwan;' Yang Wan-li (of our twelfth century, but earlier than KH Hst) says‘ Khwan is a minister or servant. Ti is his ruler. All that a ruler has .to do with his minister is to require his service.' 1 On the struggles in ZAien’ he says:— 'Kh ien is the trigram of the north-west, when the yin influence is growing strong and the yang diminishing.’ The ‘purity ’ predicated in paragraph 9 of things in Sun, was chap. 6. APPENDIX V. Chapter VI. 10. When we speak of Spirit we mean the subtle (presence and operation of God) with all things. For putting all things in motion there is nothing more vehement than thunder; for scattering them there is nothing more effective than wind; for drying them up there is nothing more parching than fire ; for giving them pleasure and satisfaction there is nothing more grateful than a lake or marsh; for moistening them there is nothing more enriching than water; for bringing them to an end and making them begin again there is nothing more fully adapted than Kan. Thus water and fire contribute together to the one object; thunder and wind do not act con trary. to each other; mountains and collections of water interchange their influences. It is in this way, that they are able to change and transform, and to give completion to all things. explained by M ng Khang-^ang (our second century) as equiva lent to ‘newness,’ referring to the brightness of all things in the light of spring and summer. On ‘ all things receive from the earth their fullest nourishment' the same Yang, quoted above, says:— ‘ The earth performs the part of a mother. All things are its children. What a mother has to do for her children is simply to nourish them.’ Chapter VI is the sequel of the preceding, There ought to have been some mention of Shan or ‘Spirit’ in chapter 5. It is the first character in this chapter, and the two characters that follow show that it is here resumed for the purpose of being explained. As it does not occur in chapter 5, we must suppose that the author of it here brings forward and explains the idea of it that was in his mind. Many of the commentators recognise this,—e.g. Liang Yin, as quoted in the Introduction, p, 33. Two other peculiarities in the style of the chapter are pointed out and explained (after a fashion) by 3hui JTing (earlier, probably, than the Sung dynasty)‘ The action of six of the trigrams is described, but no mention is made of K/iien or Khwan. But THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX V. CHAP. 7. ] CHAP. 10. Chapter VII. 11. Kh ien is (the symbol of) strength; Khwan, of docility; /Can, of stimulus to movement; Sun, of penetration; Khan, of what is precipitous and perilous; Li, of what is bright and what is catching; Kan, of stoppage or arrest; and Tui, of pleasure and satisfaction. heaven and earth do nothing, and yet do everything; hence they are able to perfect the spirit-like subtilty of the action of thunder, wind, and the other things. (Moreover), we have the trigram Kan mentioned, the only one mentioned by its name, instead of our reading “ mountains.” The reason is, that the putting in motion, the scattering, the parching, and the moistening, are all the pal pable effects of thunder, wind, fire, and water. But what is ascribed to Kan, the ending and the recommencing all things, is not so evident of mountains. On this account the name of the trigram is given, while the things in nature represented by the trigrams are given in those other cases. The style suitable in each case is employed.’ Chapter VII mendons the attributes, called also the 'virtues,’ of the different trigrams. It is not easy to account for the qualities— 1 their nature and feelings '—ascribed to them. Khung Ying-ta saysJ/rien is represented by heaven, which revolves without ceasing, and so it is the symbol of strength; Khw&n by the earth, which receives docilely the. action of heaven, and so it is the symbol of docility; Jan by thunder, which excites and moves all things, and so it is the symbol of what produces movement; Sun by wind, which enters everywhere, and so it is the symbol of pene tration; Khan hy water, found in a place perilous and precipitous, and the name is explained accordingly; LI by fire, and fire is sure to lay hold of things, and so it is the symbol of being attached to; Kfin by a mountain, the mass of which is still and arrests progress, and so it is the symbol of stoppage or arrest; and Tui by a lake or marsh, which moistens all things, and so it is the symbol of satisfaction.’ The Khang-hsi editors consider this explanation of the qualities of the trigrams to be unsatisfactory, and certainly it has all the appearance of an ex post facto account. They prefer the views of the philosopher Shfio (of our eleventh century), which is based on the arrangement of the undivided and divided lines in the figures. This to me is more unsatisfactory than the other. The editors say, Chapter VIII. 12. /f/nen (suggests the idea of) a horse; Khwan, that of an ox; /Can, that of the dragon; Sun, that of a fowl; Khan, that of a pig; Li, that of a pheasant; Kan, that of a dog; and Tui, that of a sheep. Chapter IX. 13. Kh ien suggests the idea of the head; Khwan, that of the belly; /Can, that of the feet; Sun, that of the thighs; Khan, that of the ears; Li, that of the eyes; Kan, that of the hands; and Tui, that of the mouth. Chapter X. 14. /C/den is (the symbol of) heaven, and hence has the appellation of father. Khwan is (the symbol of) earth, and hence has the appella tion of mother, /fan shows a first application (of Khwan to Kh ien), resulting in getting (the first of) its male (or undivided lines), and hence is called ‘ the oldest son/ Sun shows a first application (of if//ien to Khwan), resulting in getting (the first of) its female (or divided lines), and hence is called ‘the oldest daughter.’ Khan shows a second application moreover, that Shao's account of the three yang trigrams, Jan, Khan, and Kan is correct, and that of the three yin, Sun, Li, and Tui incorrect; but this would be based on king Wan’s arrangement, which does not appear to have place here. Chapter VIII. In the Great Appendix, p. 383, it is said that Ffi-hsi, in making his trigrams, was guided by 'the consideration of things apart from his own person.’ Of such things we have a specimen here, The creatures are assigned, in their classes, to the different trigrams, symbolising the ideas in the last. chapter. We must not make any difference of sex in translating their names. Chapter IX. Ffi-hsi found also ‘ things near at hand, in his own person,’ while making the trigrams. We have here a specimen of such things. 430 THE APPENDIXES. CHAP. n. (of Khwan to Kh ien), resulting in getting (the second of) its male (or undivided lines), and hence is called ‘the second son.’ Lt shows a second appli cation (of Kh\\t n to Khwan), resulting in getting the second of its female (or divided lines), and hence is called ‘ the second daughter.’ Kan shows a third application (of Klnvan to Khit n), resulting in get ting (the third of) its male (or undivided lines), and hence is called ‘ the youngest son.’ Tui shows a third application (of Khitn to Khw&n), resulting in getting (the third of) its female (or divided lines), and hence is called 1 the youngest daughter.’ Chapter XI. 15. KK\\t n suggests the idea of heaven; of a circle; of a ruler; of a father; of jade; of metal; of cold; of ice; of deep red; of a good horse; of an old horse; of a thin horse; of a pie bald horse; and of the fruit of trees. 16, Khwan suggests the idea of the earth; of a mother; of cloth; of a caldron; of parsimony; of a turning lathe ;■ of a young heifer; of a large wag gon ; of what is variegated; of a multitude; and of a handle and support. Among soils it denotes what is black. 17. Aan suggests the idea of thunder; of the dragon ; of (the union of) the azure and the yellow; of development; of a great highway ; of the eldest son; of decision and vehemence; of bright young bamboos; of sedges and rushes; among horses, of Chapter X has been discussed in the Introduction, pp. 49 and 50. Let it simply be added here, that the account which it does give of the formation of the six subsidiary trigrams is inconsistent with their gradual rise from the mutual imposition of the undivided and divided lines. chap. n. appendix V. 431 the good neigher; of one whose white hind-leg appears, of the praticer, and of one with a white star in his forehead. Among the productions of husbandry it suggests the idea of what returns to life from its disappearance (beneath the surface), of what in the end becomes the strongest, and of what is the most luxuriant. 18. Sun suggests the idea of wood ; of wind; of the oldest daughter; of a plumb-line; of a carpenter’s square; of being white; of being long; of being lofty; of advancing and receding; of want of deci sion; and of strong scents. It suggests in the human body, the idea of deficiency of hair; of a wide forehead; of a large development of the white of the eye. (Among tendencies), it suggests the close pursuit of gain, even to making three hundred per cent, in the market. In the end it may become the trigram of decision. 19. K han suggests the idea of water; of channels and ditches (for draining and irrigation); of being- hidden and lying concealed; of being now straight, and now crooked; of a bow, and of a wheel. As referred to man, it suggests the idea of an increase of anxiety; of distress of mind; of pain in the ears;—it is the trigram of the blood; it suggests the idea of what is red. As referred to horses, it sug gests the idea of the horse with an elegant spine; of one with a high spirit ; of one with a drooping head; of one with a thin hoof; and of one with a i; shambling step. As referred to carriages, it suggests t one that encounters many risks. It suggests what ' goes right through; the moon; a thief. Referred j to trees, it suggests that which is strong, and firm- hearted. THE APPENDIXES. CHAP. XI. 20. Li suggests the emblem of fire; of the sun; of lightning; of the second daughter; of buff-coat and helmet; of spear and sword. Referred to men, it suggests the large belly. It is the trigram of dry ness. 11 suggests the emblem of a turtle; of a crab; of a spiral univalve; of the mussel; and of the tor toise. Referred to trees, it suggests one which is hollow and rotten above. 21. Kan suggests the emblem of a mountain; of a by-path; of a small rock; of a gateway; of the fruits of trees and creeping plants; of a porter or a eunuch; of the (ring) finger; of the dog; of the rat; of birds with powerful bills; among trees, of those which are strong, with many joints. 22. Tui suggests the emblem of a low-lying col lection of water; of the youngest daughter; of a sorceress; of the mouth and tongue; of the decay and putting down (of things in harvest); of the removal (of fruits) hanging (from the stems or branches); among soils, of what is strong and salt; of a concubine; and of a sheep. Chapter XI may be made to comprehend all the paragraphs from the 15th to the end, and shows how universally the ideas underlying the Yi are diffused through the world of nature. The quality of the several trigrams will be found with more or less of truth, and with less or more of fancy, in the objects mentioned in connexion with them. More needs not to be said on the chapter than has been done in the Introduction, pp, 53 and 54. APPENDIX VI. The Orderly Sequence of the Hexagrams. Section I. 1-3. When there were heaven and earth, then afterwards all things were produced. What fills up (the space) between heaven and earth are (those) all things. Hence (Kkitn and Khwan) are fol lowed by Km \\ Km denotes filling up. 3-6. Km is descriptive of things on their first production. When so produced, they are sure to be in an undeveloped condition. Hence ATun is followed by Mang. Mang is descriptive of what is undeveloped,-—the young of creatures and things. These in that state require to be nourished. Hence Mang is followed by Hsu. Hsu is de scriptive of the way in which meat and drink (come to be supplied) z . Over meat and drink there are sure to be contentions 2 . Hence Hsu is followed by Sung. 6-8. Sung is sure to cause the rising up of the multitudes 3 ; and hence it is fallowed by Sze. Sze has the signification of multitudes 3 , and between multitudes there must be some bond of union. Hence it is followed by PI, which denotes being attached to. 8-11. (Multitudes in) union must be subjected to some restraint. Hence PI is followed by Hsiao [16] f f 434 the appendixes. sect. i. Kht. When things are subjected to restraint, there come to be rites of ceremony, and hence Hsiho Kkil is followed by Li 4 . The treading (on what is proper) leads to Thai, which issues in a state of freedom and repose, and hence Li is followed by Thai. 11-16. Thai denotes things having free course. They cannot have that for ever, and hence it is followed by Phi (denoting being shut up and re stricted). Things cannot for ever be shut up, and hence Phi is followed by Thung 3an. To him who cultivates union with men, things must come to belong, and hence Thung Ban is followed by Td Yd. Those who have what is great should not allow in themselves the feeling of being full, and hence Td Yu is followed by W/zien. When great possessions are associated with humility, there is sure to be pleasure and satisfaction; and hence AVzien is followed by Yti. 16-19. Where such complacency is awakened, (he who causes it.) is sure to have followers 5 . They who follow another are sure to have services (to perform), and hence Sui is followed by KCi 6 . Kti means (the performance of) services. He who per forms such services may afterwards become great, and hence Kft is followed by Lin. Lin means great 8 . 19-23. What is great draws forth contemplation, and hence Lin is followed by Kwan. He who attracts contemplation will then bring about the union of others with himself, and hence Kwan is followed by Shih Ho. Shih Ho means union. But things should not be united in a reckless or irregular way, and hence Shih Ho is followed by SECT. II. APPENDIX VI. 435 Pi. Pi denotes adorning. When ornamentation has been carried to the utmost, its progress comes to an end; and hence Pi is followed by Po. Po denotes decay and overthrow, 23-26. Things cannot be done away for ever. When decadence and overthrow have completed their work at one end, redintegration commences at the other; and hence Po is followed by Fu. When the return (thus indicated) has taken place, we have not any rash disorder, and Fu is followed by Wu Wang. Given the freedom from disorder and insin cerity (which this name denotes), there may be the accumulation (of virtue), and Wft Wang is followed byTaWM, 26-30. Such accumulation having taken place, there will follow the nourishment of it; and hence Ta KM is followed by L i denotes nourishing. Without nourishment there could be no movement, and hence ! is followed by Ta Kwo. Things can not for ever be in a state of extraordinary (progress) ; and hence Ti Kwo is followed by Kh&n. Khan denotes falling into peril. When one falls into peril, he is sure to attach himself to some person or thing; and hence Khan is followed by Li. Li denotes being attached, or adhering, to. 31,32. H eaven and earth existing, all (material) things then got their existence. All (material) things having existence, 'afterM^^ ^^ ^^& a l e anc ' female. From the exis^J^^^^d female there came afterwards husband ajK|j|jj|. From F f 2 43 ^ THE APPENDIXES. husband and wife there came father and son. From father and son there came ruler and minister. From ruler and minister there came high and low. When (the distinction of) high and low had existence, after wards came the arrangements of propriety and right eousness. The rule for the relation of husband and wife is that it should be long-enduring. Hence Hsien is followed by Hang. Hang denotes long en during 7 . 32-37. Things cannot lopg abide in the same place; and hence Hang is followed by Thun. Thun denotes withdrawing. Things cannot be for ever withdrawn; and hence Thun is succeeded by T 4 Zwang. Things cannot remain for ever (simply) in the state of vigour; and hence T£ Afwang is succeeded by din. 3 in denotes advancing. (But) advancing is sure to lead to being wounded; and hence 3 i n is succeeded by M i n g 1. 1 denotes being wounded. He who is wounded abroad will return to his home; and hence Ming 1 is followed by K\\t Zan. 37-40. When the right administration of the family is at an end, misunderstanding and division will ensue; and hence K\\i Zan is followed by Khwei. Khwei denotes misunderstanding and division; and such a state is sure to give rise to difficulties and complications. Khwei therefore is followed by Afien, Afien denotes difficulties; but things cannot remain for ever in such a state. ATi e n therefore is followed by ATieh, which denotes re laxation and ease, 40-44. In a state of relaxation and ease there are sure to be losses; and hence ATieh is followed APPENDIX VI. by Sun. But when Sun (or diminution) is going on without end, increase is sure to come. Sun therefore is followed by Yi. When increase goes on without end, there is sure to come a dispersing of it, and hence Yi is followed by Kwai, Kwai denotes dispersion. But dispersion must be succeeded by a meeting (again). Hence Kwai is followed by K&u, which denotes such meeting. 44-4S. When things meet together, a collection is then formed. Hence K&u is followed by 3hui, which name denotes being collected. When (good men) are collected and mount to the highest places, there results what we call an upward advance; and hence 3hui is followed by Shang. When such advance continues without stopping, there is sure to come distress; and hence Shang is followed by Khwan. When distress is felt in the height (that has been gained), there is sure to be a return to the ground beneath; and hence Khwan is followed by Bing- 48, 49. What happens under 3 ing requires to be changed, and hence it is followed by Ko (denoting change). 49-55. For changing the substance of things there is nothing equal to the caldron; and hence Ko is followed by Ting. For presiding over (that and all other) vessels, no one is equal to the eldest son, and hence Ting is followed by Afan. Afan conveys the idea of putting in motion. But things cannot be kept in motion for ever. The motion is stopped; and hence Afan is followed by Kan, which gives the idea of arresting or stopping. Things cannot be kept for ever in a state of repression, and hence Kin is followed by ATen, which gives the idea of 438 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. II. (gradually) advancing. With advance there must be a certain point that is arrived at, and hence Kit n is succeeded by Kwei Mei. When things thus find the proper point to which to come, they are sure to become great. Hence Kwei Mei is succeeded by Fang, which conveys the idea of being great. 55-57. He whose greatness reaches the utmost possibility, is sure to lose his dwelling; and hence Fang is succeeded by Lii (denoting travellers or strangers). We have in it the idea of strangers who have no place to receive them, and hence Lti is followed by Sftn, which gives the idea of (penetrating and) entering. 57-59. One enters (on the pursuit of his object), and afterwards has pleasure in it; hence Sftn is fol lowed by T u i. T u i denotes pleasure and satis faction. This pleasure and satisfaction (begins) afterwards to be dissipated, and hence Tui is fol lowed by Hwan, which denotes separation and division, 59-62. A state of division cannot continue for ever, and therefore Hwan is followed by 3 ieh (or the system of regulations) having been established, men believe in it, and hence it is fol lowed by Wung FA When men have the belief which Wung Fft implies, they are sure to carry it into practice; and hence it is succeeded by Hsido Kwo. 62-64. He that surpasses others is sure to remedy (evils that exist), and therefore Hsi&o Kwo is succeeded by Ki 31 . But the succession of events cannot come to an end, and therefore Ki 3! is SECT. II, APPENDIX VI. succeeded by Wei 31, with which (the hexagrams) come to a close. The few sentences on this Appendix in the Introduction, pp. 54, 55, are sufficient. It shows the importance of the meaning of the name in the attempt to explain the lineal figures, and prepares us to expect on each one a brief enigmatical essay, which, it has been seen, is the nature of the Text. But the writer, whoever he was, is by no means careful 'always to follow that Text in the significance of the characters, as will appear in the few instances to which attention is called in the following notices. The treatise is too slight to require, or to justify, an exhibition of all its inaccuracies. 1 But ATun does not denote filling up. It is the symbol of being in a state of distress and difficulty. The writer is thinking of the result of the interaction of heaven and earth as being to fill all between them with the various forms of living beings; and to represent that he gives the result of Afun, and not its meaning. He makes a blunder which might have been easily avoided, for he adds immediately that the character is descriptive of things on their first production. a It is difficult to follow the writer here. Hsti in the Text is the symbol of the idea of waiting. Does he mean that a provision of food and drink can only be made gradually? There is nothing in the character Hsti to awaken in the mind the idea of nourish ment. Then the genesis of contention which is given is strange. The. writer probably had in his mind the lines of the Shih, II, i, ode 5. 3 1 The loss of kindly feeling oft From slightest things shall grow. Where all the fare is dry and spare, Resentments fierce may glow.’ But what is allowable, good even, in poetry, is out of place in this treatise. s Contention on a great scale will put all the population of a state in excitement and motion, and military measures of repression will be necessary. But the idea of the multitudes in Sze would seem to be simply that of number, and not that of a numerous host. In a feudal kingdom, however, all the able-bodied people might be required to join the army. THE APPENDIXES. 4 Li, the name of the ioth hexagram, is the symbol for a shoe, and the act of treading or walking. It seems here to be derived from the homophonous 11 , the symbol of acts of ceremony. The identity of sound or name must be considered as accidental. A measured step would be one of the first ways in which the inward sense of propriety would manifest itself. 6 By the subject of Tfi Yfi and Z/rien we must understand the possessor of the kingdom,—the great man who in his greatness is yet distinguished by humility. He attracts followers. 11 For the true meaning of K \\1 and Lin, the names of hexa grams r8,19, see what is said in the notes on the Text of them. 1 The same reference should be made to the notes on the Text of LI si en and many of the other hexagrams that follow. APPENDIX VII. Treatise on the Hexagrams taken promiscuously, according to the opposition or diversity of their meaning. This last of the Appendixes is touched on very briefly in the concluding paragraph of the Introduction, p. 55. It is stated there to be in rhyme, and I have endeavoured to give a similar form to the following version of it. The rhymes and length of the lines in the original, however, are very irregular, and I found it impossible to reproduce that irregularity in English. i, 2. Strength in 7 Y/Hen, weakness in Khwan we find. 8, 7. Pi shows us joy, and Sze the anxious mind. 19, 20. Lin gives, Kw&n seeks;—such are the several themes Their different figures were to teach de signed. 3.

(If he) cherish this con- idea of the Yf, as the book of change. Again and again it has been pointed out that we find in it no idea of a perfect and abiding state. Just as the seasons of the year change and pursue an ever- recurring round, so is it with the phases of society, The reign of order has been, and has terminated; and this hexagram calls us to see the struggle for its realisation recommenced. It treats of how those engaged in that struggle should conduct themselves with a view to secure the happy consummation. How the figure sets forth the state of things by its constituent trigrams will appear in Appendix II. A similar indication is supposed to be given by the lines, not one of which is in the cor rect place; the strong lines being all in even places, and the weak lines in odd. At the same time each of them has a proper corre late; and so the figure gives an intimation of some successful progress. See also Appendix I. The symbolism of the young fox suggests a want of caution on the part of those, in the time and condition denoted by the hexa gram, who try to remedy prevailing disorders. Their attempt is not successful, and they get themselves into trouble and danger. Whatever can be done must be undertaken in another way. I suppose a fox to be intended by the symbolism of line 1, bringing that animal on from the Thwan. Some of the com mentators understand it of any animal. The line is weak, at the bottom of the trigram of peril, and responds to the strong 4, which is not in its correct place. Its subject attempts to be doing, but finds cause to regret his course. The subject of line 2, strong, and in the centre, is able to repress himself, and keep back his carriage from advancing; and there is good fortune. The Khang-hst editors say that it is very difficult to understand what is said under line 3; and many critics suppose that a negative has dropt out, and that we should really read that ‘it will not be advantageous to try and cross the great stream.’ Line 4, though strong, is in an even place; and this might vitiate the endeavours of its subject to bring about a better state of things. But he is firm and correct. He is in the fourth place more over, and immediately above there is his ruler, represented by a weak line, humble therefore, and prepared to welcome his endeavours. Let him exert himself vigorously and long, as Kao $ung did in his THE \\1 KING. fidence, till he (is like the fox who) gets his head immersed, it will fail of what is right. famous expedition (see last hexagram, line 3), and he will make progress and have success. Expeditions beyond the frontiers in those days were not very remote. Intercourse was kept up between the army and the court. Rewards, distinctions, and whatever was necessary to encourage the army, were often sent to it. Line 5 is weak, in an odd place. But its subject is the ruler, humble and supported by the subject of the strong 2; and hence the auspice is very good. The subject of line 6, when the work of the hexagram has been done, appears disposed to remain quiet in the confidence of his own power, but enjoying himself; and thereby he will do right. If, on the contrary, he will go on to exert his powers, and play with the peril of the situation, the issue will be bad. THE APPENDIXES THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I.

Its (power of) moving on the earth is without limit; it is mild and docile, advantageous and firm such is the course of the superior man. ascertain how the character arose, and how it was named Thwan. r J he treatise on the Thwan is ascribed to Confucius; and I have considered in the Introduction, p, 30, whether the tradition to this effect may to any extent be admitted. I. The hexagram JT/uen is made up of six undivided lines, or of the trigram if/hen, Ffi-hsfs symbol for heaven, repeated. The Thwan does not dwell upon this, but starts, in its exposition, from the word ‘ heaven,’ supposing that the hexagram represented all the meaning which had ever been intended by that term, In para graphs 1,2,4 the four attributes in Wtin’s Text (2 being occupied vith the second, though it is not expressly named) are illustrated by the phenomena taking place in the physical world. In paragraphs 3 and 5, the subject is the sage. He is not named indeed; and Khung Ying-ti (a.d. 574-648) does not introduce him till paragraph 5, when the meaning necessitates the presence of a human agent, who rules in the world of men as eaven does.in that of nature. The ‘ connexion between the end and the beginning,’ which he sees, is that of cause and effect in the operations of nature and the course of human affairs. The various steps in t. at course are symbolised by the lines of the hexagram; ant t e real sage, conducting his ideal government, taking his measures accordingly, is represented as driving through the sky in a carnage drawn by six dragons. M Hsi extravagantly says that ie sage is Heaven, and Heaven is the sage; ’ but there is nothing like this in the text. HEX. 3. 4, ‘ If he take the initiative, he goes astray ; ’—he misses, that is, his proper course. 1 If he follow,’ he is docile, and gets into his regular (course). 1 In the south-west he will get friends: ’—he will be walking with those of his own class. ‘ In the north-east he will lose friends:’—but in the end there will be ground for congratulation. 5. ‘ The good fortune arising from resting in firm ness ’ corresponds to the unlimited capacity of the earth. III. 1. In /Tun we have the strong (Kklen) and the weak (Khwan) commencing their intercourse, and difficulties arising. 2. Movement in the midst of peril gives rise to ‘great progress and success, (through) firm cor rectness.’ 3. By the action of the thunder and rain, (which II. As the writer in expounding the Thwan of hexagram 1 starts from the word ‘heaven,’ so here he does so from the symbolic mean ing attached to ‘earth,’ What I have said on the Text about the difference with which the same attributes are ascribed to Alien and K h wan, appears clearly in paragraph 1. It is the diffeience ex pressed by the words that I have supplied, ‘power and ‘capacity. Alien originates; Khwan produces, or gives birth to what has been originated. The ‘ penetrating,' or developing ability of Khwan, as displayed in the processes of growth, is the subject of paragraph 2. ‘ I he brightness’ refers to ihe beauty that shines forth in the vegetable and animal worlds. Paragraph 3 treats of the symbol of the ‘ mare,’ to lead the mind to the course of ‘ the superior man,' the good and faithful minister and servant. See the note, corresponding to paragraph 4, on the Text. Nest ing in firmness' is the normal course of Khwan. Where it is pursued, the good effect will be great, great as the unlimited capacity of the earth. THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I. 2iy SECT, I. are symbols of Wan and Khan), all (between Heaven and earth) is filled up. But the condition of the time is full of irregularity and obscurity. Feudal princes should be established, but the feeling that rest and peace have been secured should not be indulged (even then). IV. 1. In Mang we have (the trigram for) a mountain, and below it that of a rugged defile with a stream in it. The conditions of peril and arrest III. Jun is made up of the trigrams Jin and Khan; but according to the views on king Wan’s arrangement of the trigrams, as set forth especially in Appendix V, chap. 14, the six others come from JMen and Khwan, and are said to be their children. On the first application of Khwan to JJen, there results Jan, the first line of J/rien taking the place of the last of Khwan; and on the second application, there results Khan, the middle line of JAien taking the place of that of Khwln. McClatchie renders here:—‘The Thun (Jun) diagram represents the hard and the soft (air) beginning to have sexual intercourse, and bringing forth with suffering! ’ But there is nothing in the Yf, from the beginning to the end, to justify such an interpretation, Nor do I see how, from any account of the genesis by the component trigrams, the idea of the result as signifying a state of difficulty and distress can be readily made out. In paragraph 2 there is an attempt from the virtues or attributes assigned to the trigrams to make out the result indicated in the Thwan, To move and excite is the quality of Jln; perilous ness is the quality of Khan. The power to move is likely to produce great effects; to do this in perilous and difficult circum stances requires firmness and correctness. But neither is this explanation very satisfactory. , The part of paragraph 3 depicts a condition of trouble and disorder in the natural world occasioned by the phenomena that are symbols of the significance of Jan and Khan; but this is symbolical again of the disorder and distress, political and social, characteristic of the time. Good princes throughout the nation would help to remedy that; but the supreme authority should not resign itself to indifference, trusting to them. HEX, 4. of progress (suggested by these) give (the idea in) Mang. 2. 1 Mang indicates that there will be progress and success: ’—for there is development at work in it, and its time of action is exactly what is right. ‘ I do not seek the youthful and inexperienced; he seeks me: '—so does will respond to will. 1 When he shows (the sincerity that marks) the first recourse to divination, I instruct him: ’—for possessing the qualities of the undivided line and being in the central place, (the subject of the second line thus speaks). ‘ A second and third application create annoyance, and I do not instruct so as to create annoyance:’—annoyance (he means) to the ignorant. (The method of dealing with) the young and igno rant is to nourish the correct (nature belonging to them);—this accomplishes the service of the sage. IV. The trigram Kan has for its symbol in the natural world a mountain, which stands up frowningly, and stops or arrests the progress of the traveller. Stoppage, understood sometimes actively, and sometimes passively, is called the virtue or attribute indicated j. by it. Khan, as I said on p. 32, has water for its symbol, and especially in the form of rain. Here, however, the water appears as a stream in a difficult defile, such as ordinarily appears on an approach to a mountain, and suggesting perilousness as the attri bute of such a position. From the combination of these symbols and their attributes the writer thinks that he gets the idea of the character (not the entire hexagram) Ming, as symbolical of igno rance and inexperience. See on ‘ the Great Symbolism below. Down to the last sentence of paragraph 2, all that is said is intended to show how it is that the figure indicates progress and success. The whole representation is grounded on the undivided line’s being in the central place. It is the symbol of active effort ! for the teaching of the ignorant in the proper place and time; this being responded to by the divided fifth line, representing the ignorance to be taught as docile, 1 will responds to will. But the 2l8 the appendixes. appendix I. V. i. Hsti denotes waiting. (The figure) shows peril in front; but notwithstanding the firmness and strength (indicated by the inner trigram), its subject does not allow himself to be involved (in the danger ous defile)it is right he should not be straitened or reduced to extremity. 2. When it is said that, ‘with the sincerity de clared in Hsti, there will be brilliant success, and with firmness there will be good fortune,’ this is shown by the position (of the fifth line) in the place assigned by Heaven, and its being the correct posi tion for it, and in the centre. 4 It will be advan tageous to go through the great stream;’— that is, going forward will be followed by meritorious achievement. subject of line 2 requires sincerity in the applicant for instruction, and feels that he must make his own teaching acceptable and agreeable, All this serves to bring out the idea of progress and success. 1 hen finally in the young and ignorant there is ‘a correct nature,’ a^moral state made for goodness. The efficient teacher directing his efforts to bring out and nourish that, the progress and success will be ‘great;' the service done will be worihy of ‘a sage,' V. Hsti is composed of ZAien, having the quality of strength, and of Iihan, having the quality of perilousness. The strong one might readily dare the peril, but he restrains himself and wails. 1 his is the lesson of the hexagram,-the benefit of action well considered, of plans well matured. me nun line, as we have observed more than once already, the pfcice of honour, that doe to the ruler or king, It is here cal, e Heavenly or Heaven-given seat,’ the meaning of which expn sion is clear from its occurrence in the Shih, III, j ode 2. 1.

(The coming together of) strength and peril gives (the idea in) Sung. 2. ‘Sung intimates how, though there is sin cerity in one’s contention, he will yet meet with opposition and obstruction; but if he cherish an apprehensive caution, there will be good fortune:’— a strong (line) has come and got the central place (in the lower trigram). ‘ If he must prosecute the contention to the (bitter) end, there will be evil ’.’—contention is not a thing to be carried on to extremity. ‘ It will be advantageous to meet with the great man: '—what he sets a value on is the due mean, and the correct place. * It will not be advantageous to cross the great stream: ’—one (attempting to do so) would find himself in an abyss. VI, Paragraph I here is much to the same effect as the first sentence in the notes on the Thwan of the Text. It is said, 1 Strength without peril would not produce contention; peril with out strength would not be able to contend.’ 2. ‘A strong line has come and got the central place:’—this sentence has given rise to a doctrine about the changes of trigrams and hexagrams, which has obscured more than anything else the interpretation of the Yt. Where has the strong second line come from ? From a hundred critics we receive the answer,— 1 From Tun (EE-EE).’ The reader will see that if the second and third lines of the lower trigram there be made to change places, theie results ==r, or Sung, The doctrine of changing the figures by the manipulation of the stalks did spring up between the time of Wan and his son and that of the composition of the Appendixes; but there is no trace of it in the real Text of the Yi; and it renders any scheme for the interpretation of the figures impossible. The THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I. SECT. i, HEX. 6. VII. i. (The name) Sze describes the multitude (of the host). The ‘firmness and correctness’ (which the hexagram indicates) refer to (moral) correct ness (of aim). When (the mover) is able to use the multitude with such correctness, he may attain to the royal sway, 2. There is (the symbol of) strength in the centre (of the trigram below), and it is responded to (by its proper correlate above). The action gives rise to perils, but is in accordance (with the best sentiments of men). (Its mover) may by such action distress all the country, but the people will follow him there will be good fortune, and what error should there be ? VIII. i. ‘Pi indicates that there is good for tune : ’—(the name) Pi denotes help; (and we see in the figure) inferiors docilely following (their superior). editors of the imperial Yf allow this, and on the present passage dis card the doctrine entirely, referring to the language of the T h wan on hexagrams n and 12 as fatal to it. See the notes there, and the Introduction, pp. ix-16. 'Astrong line has come' is to be taken as equivalent simply to ‘a strong line is there.’ Vhat ‘the great man sets a value on being the due mean and the correct place, his decision in any matter of contention is sure to be right. \"VII. That 1 multitude is given here as if it were^he meaning of the name Sze arose, probably, from there being but one undivided line in the figure. That is the symbol of the general, all the other lines, divided, suggest the idea of a multitude obedient to his orders. e general s place in the centre of the lower trigram, with the proper correlate in line 5, suggests the idea of firmness and cor rectness that dominates in the hexagram. But in the last sentence it is the ruler, and not the general of the host, who is the subject. Compare what is said of him with Mencius, I, i, chap. 3 *. ii, chap. 5 , &c. 2. ‘ Let (the principal party intended in it) re examine himself, (as if) by divination, whether his virtue be great, unintermitting, and firmif it be so, there will be no error:—all this follows from the position of the strong line in the centre (of the upper trigram). ‘ Those who have not rest will come to him: ’—high and low will respond to its subject. ‘With those who are (too) late in coming it will be ill: ’—(for them) the way (of good fortune here indi cated) has been exhausted. IX. 1. In Hsiao Khn the weak line occupies its (proper) position, and (the lines) above and below respond to it. Hence comes the name of Hsiao /VM (Small Restraint). 2. (It presents the symbols of) strength and flexibility. Strong lines are in the central places, and the will (of their subjects) will have free course. Thus it indicates that there will be progress and success. 3, ‘ Dense clouds but no rain’ indicate the move ment (of the strong lines) still going forward. The ‘Perilousness’ is the attribute of Khan, the lower trigram, and ‘ docility,’ or ‘accordance with others,' that of Khwan, the upper. War is like ‘ poison ’ to a country, injurious, and threatening ruin to it, and yet the people will endure and encounter it in behalf of the sovereign whom they esteem and love. VIII. There is some error in the text here,—as all the critics acknowledge. I have adopted the decision of Wfi Hsi, which by a very small change makes the whole read consistently, and in harmony with other explanations of the Thwan. ‘ The inferiors are the subjects of all the other lines gathering round their supe rior, represented in the fifth line. < The W ay has been exhausted: ’—they do not seek to promote and enjoy union till it is too late. The sentiment is the same as that in the lines of Shakespeare about the tide in the affairs of men. THE APPENDIXES. SECT, r. ‘ Commencing at our western border 1 indicates that the (beneficial) influence has not yet been widely displayed, X. i. In Li we have (the symbol of) weakness treading on (that of) strength, 2, (The lower trigram) indicates pleasure and satisfaction, and responds to (the upper) indicating strength, Hence (it is said), ‘ He treads on the tail of a tiger, which does not bite him; there will be progress and success.’ 3, (The fifth line is) strong, in the centre, and in IX. 'The weak line’ is said to occupy ‘its proper position,’ because it is in the fourth,—an even place. The ‘ responding ’ on the part of all the other lines above and below is their submitting to be restrained by it; and this arises simply from the meaning which king Wan chose to attach to the hexagram, But the restraint can only be small. The attributes of the two parts of the figure do not indicate anything else. The undivided line represents vigour and activity, and such a line is in the middle of each trigram. There cannot but be progress and success. It is not easy to explain the symbolism of the last paragraph in harmony with the appended explanations. What Khl ng-jfze, Wang Fang, and other scholars say is to this effect :-Dense clouds ought to give rain, That they exist without doing so, shows the restraining influence of the hexagram to be still at work. But the other and active influence is, according to the general idea of the figure, continuing in operationthere will be rain ere long. And this was taking place in the western regions subject to the House of Z&u, which still was only a fief of Shang, It was not for the inferior House to rule the superior. Zau was for a time restrained by Shang. Let their positions be reversed by Zau superseding ang, and the rain of beneficent government would descend on all the kingdom. This seems to be the meaning of the paragraph. This .s the answer to the riddle of it. Confucius, in his treatise on the Thwan, hints at it, but no Chinese critic has the boldness to declare it fully. HEX. II. appendix I. its correct place. (Its subject) occupies the God- (given) position, and falls into no distress or failure;—• (his) action will be brilliant. XI. ‘The little come and the great gone in Thai, and its indication that there will be good fortune with progress and success’ show to us heaven and earth in communication with each other, and all things in consequence having free course, and (also) the high and the low, (superiors and inferiors), in communication with one another, and possessed by the same aim. The inner (tri- gram) is made up of the strong and undivided lines, and the outer of the weak and divided; the inner is (the symbol of) strength, and the outer of docility; the inner (represents) the superior man, and the outer the small man. (Thus) the way of X. ‘(The symbol of) weakness’ in paragraph x, according to Wang Shan-jze (Yuan dynasty), is line 3, urged by the two strong lines below, and having to encounter the three strong lines above. Hft Ping-wan (also of the Yiian dynasty) says that the whole of the lower trigram, Tui, partaking of the yin nature, is the symbol of weakness, and the whole of Z/iien that of strength, The Aeh- /sfung editors say that, to get the full meaning, we must hold both views. , . .. Paragraph 2 has been sufficiently explained on the Thwan itself. Paragraph 3 has also been explained ; but there remains some thing to be said on the Chinese text for 'occupies^ the God- given position,’ or, literally, ‘ treads on the seat of Tn Canon McClatchie has— 1 The imperial throne is now occupied. I think that ‘the seat of Tt’ is synonymous with ‘the seat of Heaven, m paragraph 2 of this treatise on hexagram 5 * If Confucius, or who ever was the writer, had before him the phrase as it occurs m the Shft, 1 ,12, the force of Tt will depend on the meaning assigned to it in that part of the Shi That the fifth line occupies the place of authority is here the only important point. THE APPENDIXES. SECT. I, the superior man appears increasing, and that of the small man decreasing. XII. ‘The want of good understanding between the (different classes of) men in Phi, and its indica tion as unfavourable to the firm and correct course of the superior man; with the intimation that the great are gone and the little come:’—all this springs from the fact that in it heaven and earth are not in communication with each other, and all things in consequence do not have free course; and that the high and the low (superiors and inferiors) are not in communication with one another, and there are no (well-regulated) states under the sky, The inner (trigram) is made up of the weak and divided lines, and the outer of the strong and undivided; the inner is (the symbol of) weakness, and the outer of strength; the inner (represents) the small man, and the outer the superior man. Thus the way of the small man appears increasing, and that of the superior man decreasing. XI. There is nothing to be said on the explanation of the Tlnvan here beyond what has been noticed on the different para graphs of the Text. Canon McClatchie translatesThe Th wan means that Heaven and Earth have now conjugal intercourse with each other... . and the upper and lower (classes) unite together.’ But in both clauses the Chinese characters are the same. Why did he not go on to say—‘the upper and lower classes have conjugal intercourse together;’ or rather, why did he not dismiss the idea of such intercourse from his mind altogether? Why make the Yt appear to be gross, when there is not the shadow of grossness in it? The paragraph here well illustrates how the ruling idea in all the antinomies of the Yi is that of authority : and strength on the one side, and of inferiority and weakness on the other, XII. All the symbolism here springs from the trigram Khwan HEX. 14. APPENDIX I. XIII. 1. In Thung Zan the weak (line) has the place (of influence), the central place, and responds to (the corresponding line in) Kh ien (above); hence comes its name of Thung Zan (or ' Union of men’). 2. Thung Zan says:— 3. The language, ‘ Thung Zan appears here (as we find it) in (the remote districts of) the country, indicating progress and success, and that it will be advantageous to cross the great stream,’ is moulded by its containing the strength (symbolled) in Kh ien. (Then) we have (the trigram indicating) elegance and intelligence, supported by (that indicating) strength; with the line in the central, and its correct, position, and responding (to the corres ponding line above)(all representing) the correct course of the superior man. It is only the superior man who can comprehend and affect the minds of all under the sky. XIV. 1. In Tff Yft the weak (line) has the place of honour, is grandly central, and (the strong lines) above and below respond to it. Hence comes its name of Tff Yft (Having what is Great). but how can earth (symbolised by Khwan) take the place of heaven (symbolised by W/nen) ? As in nature it is heaven that originates and not earth, so in a state the upper classes must take the initiative, and not the lower. XIII. To understand the various points in this commentary, it is only necessary to refer to the Text of the hexagram. The proper correlate of line 2 is line 5, and I have said therefore that it' re sponds to (the corresponding line in) Z/Hen.’ The editors of the Khang-hsi edition, however, would make the correlate to it all the lines of jSTAien, as being more agreeable to the idea of union. I do not think that a second paragraph has been lost. The THE APPENDIXES. SECT. r. 2. The attributes (of its component trigrams) are strength and vigour with elegance and brightness. (The ruling line in it) responds to (the ruling line in the symbol of) heaven, and (consequently) its action is (all) at the proper times. In this way (it is said to) indicate great progress and success. XV. i. Kh ien indicates progress and success. It is the way of heaven to send down its bene ficial influences below, where they are brilliantly displayed. It is the way of earth, lying low, to send its influences upwards and (there) to act. 2. It is the way of heaven to diminish the full and augment the humble. It is the way of earth to overthrow the full and replenish the humble. Spiritual Beings inflict calamity on the full and bless the humble. It is the way of men to hate the full and love the humble. Humility in a posi tion of honour makes that still more brilliant; and in a low position men will not (seek to) pass beyond it. Thus it is that ‘ the superior man will have a (good) issue (to his undertakings).’ ‘Thung Zm says' is merely a careless repetition of the three concluding characters of paragraph i. XIV. The position in the fifth place indicates the dignity, and its being central, in the centre of the upper trigram, indicates the virtue, of the lord of the figure. lhe strength of the lord, moreover, is directed by intelligence; and his actions are always at the proper time, like the seasons of heaven. XV. The Thwan on this hexagram was so brief, that the writer here deals generally with the subject of humility, showing how it is valued by heaven and earth, by spirits and by men. The descent of the heavenly influences, and the low position of the earth in paragiaph i, ate both emblematic of humility. The heavenly influ ences have their 1 display’ in the beauty and fertility of the earth. hex. 16. APPENDIX I. XVI. I. In Yu we see the strong (line) re sponded to by all the others, and the will (of him whom it represents) being carried out; and (also) docile obedience employing movement (for its pur poses). (From these things comes) Yil (the Condi tion of harmony and satisfaction). 2. In this condition we have docile obedience employing movement (for its purposes), and there fore it is so as between heaven and earth;—how much more will it be so (among men) in ‘the setting up of feudal princes and putting the hosts in motion!’ 3, Heaven and earth show that docile obedience in connexion with movement, and hence the sun and moon make no error (in time), and the four seasons do not deviate (from their order). The sages show such docile obedience in connexion with their move ments, and hence their punishments and penalties are entirely just, and the people acknowledge it by their submission. Great indeed are the time and significance indicated in Yil! The way of heaven is seen, e.g. in the daily declining of the sun, and the waning of the moon after it is full; the way of earth in the fall of the year. On the meaning of ‘Spiritual Beings (Kwei Shan),’ see the Introduction, pp. 34,35.. It is difficult to say what idea the writer attached to the name. What he says of mans appreciation of humility is striking, and, 1 believe, correct. XVI. What is said in paragraph 1 about the lines has been pointed out in the notes on the Text. ‘ Obedience is the attribute of IChwan, the lower trigram, which takes the initiative in the action of the figure; and here makes use of the movement, which is the attribute of .Wan, the upper trigram. I can hardly trace the connexion between the different parts of paragraph 2. Does it not proceed on the harmony produced by the thunderous explosion between heaven and earth, as declared THE APPENDIXES. XVII. i. In Sui we see the strong (trigram) come and place itself under the weak; we see (in the two) the attributes of movement and pleasure :— this gives (the idea of) Sui. 2. * There will be great progress and success; and through firm correctness no error:’—all under heaven will be found following at such a time. 3. Great indeed are the time and significance indicated in Sui. XVIII. 1. In Ku we have the strong (trigram) above, and the weak one below; we have (below) pliancy, and (above) stopping: — these give the idea of Ku (a Troublous Condition of affairs verg ing to ruin). 2. ‘Ku indicates great progress and success:’— (through the course shown in it), all under heaven, there will be good order. * There will be advantage in crossing the great stream: ’—he who advances will encounter the business to be done. ‘(He should in Appendix II ? Then the analogy between natural phenomena and human and social experiences comes into play. Paragraph 3 is also tantalising. Why does the writer introduce the subject of punishments and penalties ? Are they a consequence of putting the hosts in motion ? XVII. The trigrams Wan and Tui are distinguished as strong and weak, Wan representing, on king Wan's scheme, ‘the eldest son,’ and Tui, ‘ the youngest daughter.’ But. ‘the strong’ here may mean the strong line, the lowest in the hexagram. As Wang 3 img-ten (Sung dynasty) says:- 1 The yang and strong line should not be below a yin and weak line, as we find it here. That is, in Sui the high places himself below the low, and the noble below; the mean:'-esteeming others higher than himself, and giving the idea of following. Then Warn denotes the production or excitement of motion, and Tui denotes pleasure; and the union of these things suggests the same idea. HEX. 20. APPENDIX I. weigh well, however, the events of) three days be fore (the turning-point), and those (to he done) three days after it:’—the end (of confusion) is the begin ning (of order); such is the procedure of Heaven. XIX. 1. In Lin (we see) the strong (lines) gradually increasing and advancing. 2. (The lower trigram is the symbol of) being pleased, and (the upper of) being compliant The strong (line) is in the central position, and is pro perly responded to. 3. ‘ There is great progress and success, along with firm correctness: ’—this is the way of Heaven. 4. ‘In the eighth month there will be evil: ’—(the advancing power) will decay after no long time. XX. 1. The great Manifester occupies an upper place (in the figure), which consists of (the trigrams XVIII. The symbolism here is the opposite of that in Sui. The upper trigram Wan is strong, denoting, according to king W&n, * the youngest son; ’ and the lower, Sun, is weak, denoting ‘the eldest daughter.’ For the eldest daughter to be below the youngest son is eminently correct, and helps to indicate the auspice of great success. The attribute of Sun is pliancy, and that of Wan stoppage or arrest. The feeble pliancy confronted by the arresting moun tain gives an idea of the evil state implied in Kfl. ‘Three days before and after the turning-point’ is, literally, ‘ three days before and after M,’ M being the name of the first of the ‘earthly stems’ among the cyclical characters. Hence it has the meaning of ‘ beginning,’ and here denotes the turning-point, at which disorder gives place to order. According to ‘ the procedure of Heaven,’ history is a narrative of change, one condition of affairs constantly giving place to another and opposite. ‘ A kingdom that cannot be moved 1 does not enter into the circle of Chinese ideas.

He is in the central position and his correct place, and thus exhibits (his lessons) to all under heaven. 2. ‘Kwan shows its subject like a worshipper who has washed his hands, but not (yet) presented his offerings;—with sincerity and an appearance of dignity (commanding reverent regard): ’—(all) beneath look to him and are transformed. 3. When we contemplate the spirit-like way of Heaven, we see how the four seasons proceed with out error. The sages, in accordance with (this) spirit-like way, laid down their instructions, and all under heaven yield submission to them. XXI. 1. The existence of something between the jaws gives rise to the name Shih Ho (Union by means of biting through the intervening article). 2. The Union by means of biting through the intervening article indicates * the successful progress (denoted by the hexagram).’ The strong and weak (lines) are equally divided (in the figure). Movement is denoted (by the lower trigram), and bright intelligence (by the upper); thunder and lightning uniting in them, and having brilliant manifestation. The weak (fifth) line is in XX, ‘The great Manifester ’ is the ruler, the principal subject of the hexagram, and represented by line 5, near the top of the figure. In that figure the lower trigram is Khwan, representing the earth, with the attribute of docility, and the upper is Sun, representing wind, with the attributes of flexibility and penetration. As is the place of line 5, so are the virtues of the ruler. The spirit-like way of Heaven' is the invisible and unfathomable agency ever operating by general laws, and with invariable regu larity, in what we call nature. Compare with this paragraph, the definition of Shan or Spirit in Appendix III, i, 32; and the doctrine of the agency of God, taught in Appendix VI,’ 8, 9. HEX. 22. APPENDIX T. the centre, and acts in its high position. Although it is noc in its proper position, this is advantageous for the use of legal constraints. XXII. 1. (When it is said that) Pi indicates that there should be free course (in what it denotes) 2. (We see) the weak line coming and ornament ing the strong lines (of the lower trigram), and hence (it is said that ornament) * should have free course.’ On the other hand, the strong line above ornaments the weak ones (of the upper trigram), and hence (it is said) that ‘ there will be little advan tage, if (ornament) be allowed to advance (and take the lead).’ (This is illustrated in the) appearances that ornament the sky. 3. Elegance and intelligence (denoted by the lower trigram) regulated by the arrest (denoted by the upper) suggest the observances that adorn human (society). 4. We look at the ornamental figures of the sky, and thereby ascertain the changes of the seasons. We look at the ornamental observances of society, and understand how the processes of transformation are accomplished all under heaven. XXI. The ‘ equal division of the strong and weak lines' is seen by taking them in pairs, though the order in the first pair is different from that in the two others. This is supposed to indicate the in telligence of the judgments in the action of the hexagram. Aan, the lower trigram, symbolises movement; Li, the upper, intelli gence. The fifth line's acting in its high position does not intimate the formation of the figure from Yf, the 42nd hexagram, but calls attention to the fact that a weak line is here ‘ lord of judgment.’ This does not seem natural, but the effect is good/-judgment is tempered by leniency. XXII. The first paragraph is either superfluous or incomplete. The language of paragraph 2 has naturally been pressed into the THE APPENDIXES. 2 3 2 XXIII. i, Po denotes overthrowing or being overthrown. We see (in the figure) the weak lines (threatening to) change the (last) strong line (into one of themselves). 2. That ‘it will not be advantageous to make a movement in any direction whatever’ appears from the fact that the small men are (now) growing and increasing. The superior man acts according to (the exigency of the time), and stops all forward movement, looking at the (significance of the) symbolic figures (in the hexagram). He values the processes of decrease and increase, of fulness and decadence, (as seen) in the movements of the heavenly bodies, service of the doctrine of changing the figures by divining manipu lation; see p. 219, on paragraph 2 of the Thwan of hexagram 6. But as the Khang-hsi editors point out, ‘ the weak line coming and ornamenting the two strong lines' simply indicates how substan tiality should have the help of ornament, and ‘the strong line above (or ascending) and ornamenting the two weak lines ’ indicates that ornament should be restrained by substantiality. Ornament has its use, but it must be kept in check.—The closing sentence has no connexion with what precedes. Some characters are wanting, to show how the writer passes on to speak of ‘ the orna mental figures of the sky.’ The whole should then be joined on to paragraph 3, The ‘figures of the sky' are all the heavenly bodies In their relative positions and various movements, producing day and night, heat and cold, &c. The observances of society are the ceremonies and performances which regulate and beautify the intercourse of men, and constitute the transforming lessons of sagely wisdom. XXIII. ‘The symbolic figures in the hexagram’ are K Invan, below, the representative of docility, acting as circumstances require; and Kan, the representative of a mountain, which arrests the progress of the traveller. The superior man of the topmost line thus interprets them, and acts accordingly. Yet he is not left without hope. Winter is followed by spring; night is hex. 23. APPENDIX 1. XXIV. i. 1 Ffi indicates the free course and pro gress (of what it denotes): ’—it is the coming back of what is intended by the undivided line. 2. (Its subject’s) actions show movement directed by accordance with natural order. Hence ‘he finds no one to distress him in his exits and entrances,’ and ‘ friends come to him, and no error is committed.’ 3. ‘ He will return and repeat his proper course; in seven days comes his return;’—such is the move ment of the heavenly (revolution). 4. ‘ There will be advantage in whatever direction movement is made : ’—the strong lines are growing and increasing. 5. Do we not see in Ffi the mind of heaven and earth ? XXV. In Wu Wang we have the strong (first) line come from the outer (trigram), and become in the inner trigram lord (of the whole figure); we have (the attributes of) motive power and strength; we have the strong line (of the fifth place) in the succeeded by day; the moon wanes, and then begins to wax again. So will it be in political life. As we read in the Hebrew prophet Isaiah, ‘In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.’ XXIY, ‘ The movement of the heavenly revolution ’ in paragraph 3 has reference to the regular alternations of darkness and light, and of cold and heat, as seen in the different months of the year, Hau Hsing-kwo (of the Thang dynasty) refers to the expressions in the Shih, I, xv, ode 1, ‘ the days of (our) first (month), second (month),’ &c., as illustrating the use of day for month, as we have it here; but that is to explain what is obscure by what is more so; though I believe, as stated on the Text, that * seven days ’ is here equivalent to ‘ seven months.' ‘The mind of heaven and earth’ is the love of life and of all goodness that rules in the course of nature and providence. THE APPENDIXES. central position, and responded to (by the weak second):—there will be ‘ great progress proceeding from correctness; such is the appointment of Heaven. 1 If (its-subject and his action) be not correct, he will fall into errors, and it will not be advantageous for him to move in any direction:’—whither can he (who thinks he is) free from all insincerity, (and ; yet is as here described) proceed ? Can anything be done (advantageously) by him whom the (will and) appointment of Heaven do not help ? XXVI. i. In (the trigrams composing) Ta Kkt we have (the attributes) of the greatest strength and of substantial solidity, which emit a brilliant light; and indicate a daily renewal of his virtue (by the subject of it). 2. The strong line is in the highest place, and suggests the value set on talents and virtue; there is power (in the upper trigram) to keep the strongest in restraint:—all this shows ‘the great correctness’ (required in the hexagram). 3. ‘The good fortune attached to the subject’s not seeking to enjoy his revenues in his own family’ shows how talents and virtue are nourished. j XXV. The advocates of one trigram’s changing into another, which ought not to be admitted, we have seen, into the interpretation | of the Yi, make Wh Wang to be derived from Sung (No. 6 ), the j second line there being manipulated into the first of this; but this representation is contrary to the words of the text, which make the | strong first line come from the outer trigram, i.e. from X&ien. And so it does, as related, not very intelligibly, in Appendix V, 10, | A'an, the lower trigram here, being 1 the eldest son,’ resulting from jgg _ the first application of Khwan to jOien. The.three peculiarities in the structure of the figure afford the auspice of progress and |||ggg| success ; and very striking is the brief and emphatic declaration, ■\" kfJUj\"-' that such progress is ‘ the appointment of Heaven.’ HEX, 27. APPENDIX I. 4. ‘It will be advantageous to cross the great stream:’—(the fifth line, representing the ruler,) is responded to by (the second, the central line of A 7 nen, representing) Heaven. XXVII. 1. ‘ 1 indicates that with firm correctness there will be good fortune: ’—when the nourishing is correct, there will be good fortune. ‘We must look at what we are seeking to nourish :’~we must look at those whom we wish to nourish. ‘ We must by the exercise of our thoughts seek the proper aliment:’ — we must look to our own nourishing of ourselves. 2. Heaven and earth nourish all things. The sages nourish men of talents and virtue, by them to reach to the myriads of the people. Great is (the work intended by this) nourishing in its time! XXVI. In paragraph 1, Tfi Khh evidently means the ‘grand accumulation ’ of virtue, indicated by the attributes of its compo nent trigrams. ‘Substantial solidity’ may very well be given as the attribute of mountains. ‘The strong line in the highest place’ of paragraph 2 is line 6, whose subject is thus above the ruler represented by 5, and has the open firmament for his range in doing his work. This, and his ability to repress the strongest opposition, show how he is sup ported by all that is correct and right. In a kingdom where the object of the government is the accumu lation of virtue, good and able men will not be left in obscurity. What will not a high and good purpose, supported by the greatest strength, be able to do? XXVII. Many of the critics, in illustration of paragraph 1, refer appropriately to Mencius, VI, i, chap. 14. In illustration of paragraph 2 they refer to the times and court of Yfio and Shun, sage rulers, from whose cherishing and nourishing came Yu to assuage the waters of the deluge, to teach the people agriculture, Hsieh as minister of instruction, Kao Yao as minister of crime, and othersall to do the work of nourishing the people.

The weak (second line) occupies the middle and correct position, and gives the indication of f a free and successful course; ’ and, moreover, ‘ nourish ing (docility like that of) the cow ’ will lead to good fortune, XXIX. On paragraph 2 Liang Yin says‘ Water stops at the proper time, and moves at the proper time. Is not this an emblem of the course of the superior man in dealing with danger ?' On paragraph 4 the Khang-hsi editors say that to exercise one's self in meeting difficulty and peril is the way to establish and strengthen the character, and that the use of such experience is seen in all measures for self-defence, there being no helmet and mail like leal-heartedness and good faith, and no shield and tower like propriety and righteousness. XXX. 'The double brightness’ in paragraph x has been much discussed. Some say that it means 1 the ruler, becoming brighter and brighter. Others say that it means both the ruler and his ministers, combining their brightness. The former view seems to me the better. The analogy between the natural objects and a transforming and perfecting rule is far fetched. < The central and correct position ’ in paragraph 2 can be said only of the second line, and not of the fifth, where an undivided line would be more correct. The ‘and moreover’ of the translation is ' therefore ’ in the original; but I cannot make out the force and suitability of that conjunction. 23B THE APPENDIXES. Section II. XXXI. i.

Heaven and earth exert their influences, and there ensue the transformation and production of all things. The sages influence the minds of men, and the result is harmony and peace all under the sky. If we look at (the method and issues) of those influences, the true character of heaven and earth and of all things can be seen. XXXII. 1. Hang denotes long continuance. The strong (trigram) is above, and the weak one below; (they are the symbols of) thunder and wind, XXXI, Paragraph 2. Tui, the upper trigrain, is weak and yin; and Kan, the lower,is strong and yang; see Appendixes III, ii, 4, and V, 10. Kan is below Tui; whereas the subject of the lower trigram should always take the initiative in these figures. HEX. 32.

The way of heaven and earth is to be long continued in their operation with out stopping. 3. (When it is said that) ‘Movement in any direction whatever will be advantageous,’ this im plies that when (the moving power) is spent, it will begin again. 4. The sun and moon, realising in themselves (the course of Heaven), can perpetuate their shining. The four seasons, by their changing and trans forming, can perpetuate their production (of things). The sages persevere long in their course, and all under the sky are transformed and perfect. When we look at what they continue doing long, the natural tendencies of heaven, earth, and all things can be seen. XXXII.

He might therefore keep his place; but looking at the two weak lines, 1 and 2, he recognises in them the advance and irrepressible progress of small men, and that for a time it is better for him to give way and withdraw from the field. Thus there is successful progress I even in his retiring,’ I XXXIV, Paragraph 1. ‘That which is great’ denotes, in the i first place, the group of four strong lines which strikes us on hex. 36.

(The symbol of) the Earth and that of Brightness entering into the midst of it give the idea of Ming t (Brightness wounded or obscured). 2. The inner (trigram) denotes being accom plished and bright; the outer, being pliant and sub missive. The case of king Wan was that of one looking at the figure, and then the superior man, or the strong men in positions of power, of whom these are the representatives. Klnen is the trigram of strength, and Aan that of movement. Paragraph 2. ‘ That which is great (should be) correct: ’—that the ‘should be’ must be supplied in the translation appears from this, that the paragraph is intended to illustrate the text that 1 it will be advantageous to be firm and correct.’ The power of man becomes then a reflexion of the great power which we see working in nature, ‘ impartially,’ ‘ unselfishly.’ XXXV. To those who advocate the view that the hexagrams of the Yi have been formed by changes of the lines in manipulating with the divining stalks, the words of paragraph 2, that we have in the figure 1 the weak line advanced and moving above,’ suggest the derivation of 3 in from Kwan, whose 4th and 5th lines are made to change places (=~= j. But we have seen that that view is inadmissible in the interpretation of the Yi. And a simple explana tion of the language at once presents itself. As Hsiang An-shih (Sung dynasty) says, ‘ Of the three “ daughter ’ trigrams it is only L! which has its divided line occupying the central place of honour, when it is the upper trigram in a hexagram.’ THE APPENDIXES. who with these qualities was yet involved in great difficulties. 3. ' It will be advantageous to realise the difficulty (of the position), and maintain firm correctness: that is, (the individual concerned) should obscure his brightness. The case of the count of K i was that of one who, amidst the difficulties of his House, was able (thus) to maintain his aim and mind correct. XXXVII. 1. In K\\i Zan the wife has her correct place in the inner (trigram), and the man his correct place in the outer. That man and woman occupy their correct places is the great righteousness shown (in the relation and positions of) heaven and earth. 2. InlCii Z an we have the idea of an authori tative ruler;—that, namely, represented by the parental authority. 3. Let the father be indeed father, and the son son; let the elder brother be indeed elder brother, and the younger brother younger brother; let the husband be indeed husband, and the wife wife:— then will the family be in its normal state. Bring the family to that state, and all under heaven will be established. XXXVI, The sun disappearing, as we say,‘ below the earth/ or, as the Chinese writer conceives it, ‘into the midst of, or within the earth/ sufficiently indicates the obscuration or wounding of bright ness,—the repression and resistance of the good and bright. King Wan was not of the line of Shang. Though opposed and persecuted by its sovereign, he could pursue his own course, till his line came in the end to supersede the other. It could not be so with the count of Ki, who was a member of the House of Shang, He could do nothing that would help on its downfall. XXXVII, Paragraph 1 first explains the statement of the hex. 38. APPENDIX I. XXXVIII. 1. Iii Khwei we have (the symbol of) Fire, which, when moved, tends upwards, and that of a Marsh, whose waters, when moved, tend down wards. We have (also the symbols of) two sisters living together, but whose wills do not move in the same direction. 2. (We see how the inner trigram expressive of) harmonious satisfaction is attached to (the outer expressive of) bright intelligence; (we see) the weak line advanced and acting above, and how it occupies the central place, and is responded to by the strong (line below). These indications show that ‘in small matters there will (still) be good fortune/ 3. Heaven and earth are separate and apart, but the work which they do is the same. Male and female are separate and apart, but with a common will they seek the same object. There is diversity between the myriad classes of beings, but there is an analogy between their several operations. Great indeed are the phenomena and the results of this condition of disunion and separation. Th wan, about the wife, represented by line 2; and then proceeds to the husband, represented by line 5. The two trigrams become representative of the family circle, and the wide world without it. In the reference to heaven and earth it is not supposed that they are really husband and wife; but in their relation and positions they symbolise that social relation and the individuals in it. Paragraph 2, more closely rendered, would be—‘That in /Via Zan there is an authoritative ruler is a way of naming father and mother/ Does the writer mean to say that while the assertion of authority was indispensable in a family, that authority must have combined in it both force and gentleness ? XXXVIII. In paragraph 1 we have first an explanation of the meaning of Khwei from the symbolism of Fft-hst. Then follows THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I. SECT, II, XXXIX. I. Zien denotes difficulty. There is (the trigram expressive of) perilousness in front. When one, seeing the peril, can arrest his steps (in accordance with the significance of the lower tri gram), is he not wise ? 2. (The language of) Wien, that ‘advantage will be found in the south-west,’ refers to the (strong fifth line) advanced and in the central place. That ‘there will be no advantage in the north-east,’ intimates that the way (of dealing with the Wien state) is exhausted. That ‘ it will be advantageous to see the great man,’ intimates that advance will lead to achievement. That the places (of the different lines after the first) are those appropriate to them indicates firm correctness and good fortune, with which the regions (of the kingdom) are brought to their normal state. Great indeed is the work to be done in the time of Wien! I HEX. 40. XL. i. In Wieh we have (the trigram expressive of) peril going on to that expressive of movement. By movement there is an escape from the peril ‘ (this is the meaning of) Wieh. I 2. ‘ In (the state indicated by) Wieh, advantage [ will be found in the south-west:’—-the movement (thus) intimated will win all. That ‘ there will be ; good fortune in coming back (to the old condi tions)’ shows that such action is that of the due medium. That ‘if some operations be necessary, there will be good fortune in the early conducting of them ’ shows that such operations will be successful. 3. When heaven and earth are freed (from the grasp of winter), we have thunder and rain. When these come, the buds of the plants and trees that produce the various fruits begin to burst. Great indeed are the phenomena in the time intimated by Wieh. an explanation from that ascribed to king Wan, where Tui repre sents the youngest daughter and Li the second. The Khang-hsi editors observe that in many hexagrams we have two daughters dwelling together, but that only in this and 49 is attention called to it. The reason, they say, is that in those two diagrams the sisters are the second and third daughters, while in the others one of them is the eldest, whose place and superiority are fixed, so that between her and either of the others there can be no division or collision. About what is said, in paragraph 2, on the weak line, as ad vanced and acting above, see the note on hexagram 35. The lesson of paragraph 3 is not unity in diversity, but union with diversity. XXXIX. The upper or front trigram is Khfin, the attribute of w ich is perilousness; the lower is Kan, of which the arresting, actively or passively, of movement or advance is the attribute. We can understand how the union of these attributes gives the ideas of dimculty and prudent caution. The explanations in paragraph 2 of the phraseologyof the Th wa n are not all easily followed. It is said that the advantageousness of the south-west is due to the central line in 5; but if we are to look for the meaning of south-west in Khwan, as in the diagram of king Wan’s trigrams, there is no strong central line in it. • May Kb fin, as a yang trigram, be used for Khwan? XL. 1. The meaning of the hexagram is brought out sufficiently well in paragraph x by means of the attributes of the constituent trigrams. 2. How it is that the movement indicated in the first condition will 1 win ’ all does not immediately appear. The Khan^-hsi editors say that ‘ moving to the south and west ’ is the same as * returning back to the old conditions/ and that ‘winning all and acting ‘ according to the due medium ' are descriptive of the effect and method without reference to the symbolism. Another explanation might be devised; but I prefer to leave the matter in doubt. 3. Paragraph 3 shows the analogy of what takes place in nature to the beneficent social and political changes described in the text, as is done very frequently in this Appendix. THE APPENDIXES. SECT. ir. APPENDIX I. XLI. 1. In Sun (we see) the lower (trigram) j diminished, and the upper added to. (But) the method (of action) implied in this operates also ; above (or, mounts upwards (also) and operates). j 2. ‘ If there be sincerity in this method of dimi- I nution, there will be great good fortune; freedom ; from error; firmness and correctness that can be maintained; and advantage in every movement that shall be made. In what shall this (sincerity in the exercise of Sun) be employed? (Even) in sacrifice, two baskets of grain, (though there be nothing else), may be presented:’—for these two baskets there ought to be the fitting time. There is a time when the strong should be diminished, and the weak should be strengthened. Diminution and increase, overflowing and emptiness: —these take place in harmony with the conditions of the time. XLI. 1. All that we see is two undivided lines in the lower trigrain, and then a divided one, and exactly the opposite in the upper. But the whole figure could not but have this form from the process of its formation, whether by the gradual addition of the two primitive lines, or by the imposition of the whole trigrams on one another. To say that the upper lines of Khxtn. and Khwan changed places to express the idea of subjects contributing in taxes to the main tenance of their ruler is absurd; and if that thought were in the mind of king Wan (which I very much doubt), it would only show how he projected his own idea, formed independently of the figure, into its lines. On the second sentence, the Khang-hsi editors say' When a minister devotes his life in the service of his lord, or the people undertake their various labours in behalf of their government, these are instances of the ministering of those below to increase those above. But in this way the intercourse of the two becomes close and their aims become the same;—does not the method of action of those below communicate itself to those above ? ’ In paragraph 2 the subject of contribution, such as the payment of HEX. 42. XLII. 1. Ill Yi we see the upper (trigram) diminished, and the lower added to. The satis faction of the people (in consequence of this) is without limit. What descends from above reaches to all below, so great and brilliant is the course (of its operation). 2. That ‘ there will be advantage in every move ment which shall be undertaken ’ appears from the central and correct (positions of the second and fifth lines), and the (general) blessing (the dispensing of which they imply). That ‘it will be advantageous (even) to cross the great stream ’ appears from the action of wood (shown in the figure). 3. Yi is made up of (the trigrams expressive of) movement and docility, (through which) there is daily advancement to an unlimited extent. We have (also) in it heaven dispensing and earth pro ducing, leading to an increase without restriction taxes, passes into the background. The Khang-hsi editors say ' What is meant by diminishing in this hexagram is the regu lation of expenditure or contribution according to the time. This would vary in a family according to its poverty or wealth; and in a state according to the abundance or scantiness of its resources. When it is said that there must be sincerity along with a diminu tion, it means that though such a diminution cannot be helped, yet what is given should be given sincerely. A small sacrifice sincerely offered is accepted. In the language,\" There is a time when the strong should be diminished and the weak be strengthened,” we are not to find the two baskets in the diminution of the strong. “ The strong” is what is essential,—in this case sincerity; “The weak” is what is unimportant,—the amount and manner of the offering. If one supplement the insufficiency of his offering with the abun dance of his sincerity, the insignificance of his two baskets will not be despised.’ THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I. of place. Everything in the method of this increase proceeds according to the requirements of the time. XLII, 1. The process of the formation of the trigrams here is the reverse of that in the preceding hexagram; and is open to the I remarks I have made on that. Of course the people are full of complacency and pleasure in the labours of their ruler for their ! good. 2. The mention of'the action of wood' has reference to the upper trigram Sun, which is the symbol both of wind and wood. From wood boats and ships are made, on which the great stream may be crossed. In three hexagrams, this, 59, and 6r, of which Sun is a part, we find mention made of crossing the great stream. It is generally said that the lower trigram Ain also symbolises wood; but that is obtained by a roundabout process. Jan occu pies the place of the east in Wan's arrangement of the trig-rams; but the east symbolises spring, when the growth of vegetation begins; and therefore Jan may symbolise wood 1 It was slated on p. 33, that the doctrine of ‘ the five elements ’ does not appear in the Yi, J/Angqze takes wood mfi), ‘as a misprint for increase yi).’ 3, The words ‘heaven dispensing and earth producing’ are based on the fan cied genesis of the figure from J/iien and i Khwan|-— —-1 the first lines in each changing places. It was the author of this Appendix, probably, who first introduced that absurd notion in connexion with the formation of Sun andYi. One rhyme runs through and connects these three paragraphs thus 4 Y! spoils the high, gives to the low; The people feel intense delight. Down from above to all below, The blessing goes, so large and bright. Success will every movement mark, Central its source, its course aright. The great stream even may be crossed, When planks of wood their strength unite. Yi movement shows and docile feet, Which progress day by day invite. Heaven gives; productive earth responds; Increase crowns every vale and height; HEX. 43. XLIII. 1. Kwdi is the symbol of displacing or removing. We see (in the figure) the strong (lines) displacing the weak. (We have in it the attributes of) strength and complacency. There is displacement, but harmony (continues). 2. ‘ The exhibition (of the criminal’s guilt) in the royal courtyard’ is suggested by the (one) weak (line) mounted on the five strong lines. There 1 is an earnest and sincere appeal (for sym pathy and support), and a consciousness of the peril (involved in the undertaking)it is the realisation of this danger, which makes the method (of compass ing the object) brilliant. ‘He should make an announcement in his own city, and show that it will not be well to have recourse at once to arms: ’—(if he have recourse to arms), what he prefers will (soon) be exhausted. * There will be advantage in whatever he shall go forward to: ’—when the growth of the strong (lines) has been completed, there will be an end (of the displacement). And ceaselessly it hastens on, Each season's gifts quick to requite.’ XLIII. 1. The last clause of paragraph 1 is good in itself, show ing that the strong and worthy statesman in removing a bad man from the state is not actuated by any private feelings. The senti ment, however, as it is expressed, can hardly be said to follow from the symbolism. Paragraph 2. The same may be said of all the notes appended to the different clauses of this second paragraph. HU Pmg-wan (YUan dynasty) says:-‘If but a single small man be left, he is sufficient to make the superior man anxious; if but a single inordi nate desire be left in the mind, that is sufficient to disturb the harmony of heavenly principles. The eradication in both cases must be complete, before the labour is ended. THE APPENDIXES. XLIV. i. Kau has the significance of unex pectedly coming on. (We see in it) the weak (line) coming unexpectedly on the strong ones. 2. ‘It will not be good to marry (such) a female:’-—one (so symbolised) should not be long- associated with. 3. Heaven and earth meeting together (as here represented), all the variety of natural things become fully displayed. 4. When a strong (line) finds itself in the central and correct position, (good government) will greatly prevail all under the sky. 5. Great indeed is the significance of what has to be done at the time indicated by Kfiu! XLV. 1. 3 hui indicates (the condition of union, or) being collected. We have in it (the symbol of) docile obedience going on to (what is expressed by that of) satisfaction. There is the strong line in the central place, and rightly responded to. Hence comes the (idea of) union. 2. ‘ The king will repair to his ancestral temple: XLIV. On paragraph 1 the Khang-hsi editors say‘ “ The weak line meets with (or comes unexpectedly on) the strong ones;\"— the weak line, that is, plays the principal part. The case is like that of the minister who assumes the power of deciding for himself on all measures, or of a hen’s announcing the morningis not the name of (shameless) boldness rightly applied to it f Hence nothing more is said about the symbol of the bold female; but attention is called to the second part of the Thwan,’ Paragraph 2 needs no remark. Paragraphs 3,4, and 5 all speak of the importance of powers and parties meeting together,—in the world of nature, and in the sphere of human affairs. But I do not see how this sentiment is a natural sequel to that in 1 and 2, nor that it has any connexion with the teaching of the Thwan and Symbolism, HEX. 46. APPENDIX I. with the utmost filial piety he presents his offerings (to the spirits of his ancestors). ‘It will be advantageous to meet the great man, and there will then be prosperity and success: the union effected by him will be on and through what is correct. ‘The use of great victims will conduce to good fortune; and in whatsoever direction movement is made, it will be advantageous: ’—all is done in accordance with the ordinances of Heaven. 3. When we look at the way in which the gather ings (here shown) take place, the natural tendencies (in the outward action) of heaven and earth and of all things can be seen. XLVI. 1. (We find) the weak (line), as it finds the opportunity, ascending upwards. 2. We have (the attribute) of flexibility and that of obedience; we have the strong line (below) and its proper correlate abovethese things indicate that there will be ‘ great progress and success.’ XLV. The lower trigram in fthui is Khwan, whose attribute is docile obedience; and the upper isTui, whose attribute is pleased satisfaction. Then we have the strong line in 5, and its proper correlate in 2. These things may give the idea of union. They might also give the idea of other good things. The Khang-hsi editors say that though 1 all is done in accord ance with the ordinances of Pleaven’ follows the concluding clauses of the Thwan, yet the sentiment of the words must be extended to the other clauses as well. jOang-jze says that ‘ the ordinances of Heaven ’ are simply the natural and practical outcome of‘heavenly principle;'—in this case what should and may be done according to the conditions and requirements of the time. So do,the critics of China try to shirk the idea of personality in ‘Heaven.’ With paragraph 3, compare the concluding paragraphs of the Thwan ifwan on hexagrams 31,32. 252 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. n. 3. ‘Seeking (by the qualities implied in Shang) to meet with the great man, its subject need have no anxiety: ’—there will be ground for congratulation. ‘Advance to the south will be fortunate:’—his aim will be carried out. XLVII. 1. In Khwan (we see) the strong (lines) covered and obscured (by the weak). 2. We have in it (the attribute of) perilousness going on to that of satisfaction. Who is it but the superior man that, though straitened, still does not fail in making progress to his proper end ? ‘ For the firm and correct, the (really) great man, there will be good fortune: ’—this is shown by the central positions of the strong (lines). ‘ If he make speeches, his words cannot be made good: ’— to be fond of arguing or pleading is the way to be reduced to extremity, XLVL The explanation of the first paragraph has given occasion to much difference of opinion. Some will have' the weak (line) ’ to be 4; some 5; and some the whole of Khwan, the upper trigram, The advocates of 4, make it come from hexagram 40, the weak 3 of which ascends to the strong 4, displaces it, and takes its place ; but w r e have seen repeatedly the folly of the doctrine of changing lines and figures. 1 he great symbolism of Appendix II suggests the proper explanation. The lower trigram, Sun, represents here not wind but wood. The first line, weak, is the root of a tree planted beneath the earth. Its gradual growth symbolises the advance upwards of the subject of the hexagram, fostered, that is, by the circumstances of the time. XLVII. I, One sees the relative position of the strong and weak lines in the figure; but to deduce from that the idea expressed by Khwan requires a painful straining of the imagination. That idea was in the mind, and then the lines were interpreted accordingly. 2, Perilousness is the attribute of the lower trigram, and ‘ satis faction that of the upper. The superior man, however straitened, HEX. 49. APPENDIX I. XLVIII. 1. (We have the symbol of) wood in the water and the raising of the water; which (gives us the idea of) a well. A well supplies nourishment and is not (itself) exhausted. 2. ‘ The site of a town may be changed, while the fashion of its wells undergoes no change:’— this is indicated by the central position of the strong lines (in the second and fifth places). ‘The drawing is nearly accomplished, but the rope has not yet reached the water of the well: ’— its service has not yet been accomplished. ‘The bucket is broken:’ —it is this that occa sions evil. XLIX. 1. In Ko (we see) water and fire extin guishing each other; (we see also) two daughters dwelling together, but with their minds directed to remains master of himself, and pursues the proper end of principle settled in his mind. Why should the subject of Khwan make speeches, be fond of arguing or pleading,—as the characters say, if we could translate them literally, ‘ setting a value on the mouth ?' The reply to this is found in the trigram denoting ‘satisfaction,’ or ‘being pleased,’ The party in the extremity of Khwan yet wishes and tries to make men pleased with him. XLVIII. /fang Khang-ZMng says :-‘Khan, the upper trigram, represents water, and Sun, the lower, wood. This wood denotes the water-wheel or pulley with its bucket, which descends into the mouth of the spring, and brings the water up to the top. This may be a correct explanation of the figure, though the reading of it from bottom to top seems at first to be strange. Paragraph 2. That the fashion of the well does not undergo any (great) change is dwelt upon as illustrating the unchangeable ness of the great principles of human nature and of government. But that this truth may be learned from the strong and central lines only produces a smile. So do the remarks on the other two sentences of the Thwan. THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX I. SECT. ir. different objects:—(on account of these things) it is called (the hexagram of) Change. 2. ‘It is believed in (only) after it has been accomplished: ’—when the change has been made, faith is accorded to it. (We have) cultivated intelligence (as the basis of) pleased satisfaction, (suggesting) ‘ great progress and success,’ coming from what is correct. When change thus takes place in the proper way, ‘ occasion for repentance disappears.’ 3. Heaven and earth undergo their changes, and the four seasons complete their functions. Thang changed the appointment (of the line of Hsid to the throne), and Wft (that of the line of Shang), in accordance with (the will of) Heaven, and in response to (the wishes of) men. Great indeed is what takes place in a time of change. L. 1, In Ting we have (symbolically) the figure of a caldron. (We see) the (symbol of) wood enter ing into that of fire, which suggests the idea of cook' XLIX. Paragraph 1, Lf, the lower trigram, represents fire, and 1 ui, the upper, represents water. Water will extinguish fire, and fiie again will dry up water. Each, to all appearance, produces a change in the other. Again, according to king Wan's scheme of the trigrams, as shown on p. 33, and in Figure 1, Plate III, LI is the second, and Tui the youngest daughter. Their wills are likely to differ in love and other things; but this symbolism does not so readily suggest the idea of change. 2, The first sentence suggests how the dislike to change on the part of people generally is overcome. The second suggests how change proceeding from intelligence and giving general satisfaction will be successful. Paragraph 3 tells us how the greatest natural and the greatest political changes are equally successful and admirable when con ducted aright. HEX, gl. ing. The sages cooked their offerings in order to present them to God, and made great feasts to nourish their wise and able (ministers). 2. We have (the symbol of) flexible obedience, and that (which denotes) ears quick of hearing and eyes clear-sighted. (We have also) the weak (line) advanced and acting above, in the central place, and responded to by the strong (line below). All these things give the idea of ‘ great progress and success.’ LI. 1. iTan (gives the intimation of) ease and development. 2. ‘When the (time of) movement (which it indicates) comes, (its subject) will be found looking out with apprehension: ’—that feeling of dread leads to happiness. ‘ And yet smiling and talking cheer fully : ’—the issue (of his dread) is that he adopts (proper) laws (for his course). ‘ The movement (like a crash of thunder) terrifies L. 1. See the notes on the Text of the Thwan about the figure of a caldron in Ting. Its component trigrams are Sun representing wood, and Li representing fire; which may very well suggest the idea of cooking. The last sentence of the paragraph is entirely after the style of ‘ the Great Symbolism.’ The Khang- hsi editors say that the distinction between Bing and Ting appears here very clearly, the former relating to the nourishment of the people, and the latter to the nourishing men of worth. They add that the reality of the offerings to God is such nourishing. ‘ God' is here Shang Ti, which Canon McClatchie translates 'the First Emperor,’ adding in a note,' The Chinese Jupiter, the Emperor of gods and men! ’ 2, The first sentence deduces the sentiment of the Thwan from the attributes or virtues of the trigrams with considerable amplifica tion of the virtue of Lf. The second line of Li, as being divided, calls forth in other hexagrams the same notice as here. It is the most important line in the figure, and being responded to by the strong 2, gives an indication of the ‘great progress and success. 256 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. II. all within a hundred 11: ’—it startles the distant and frightens the near. ‘He will be like the sincere worshipper, who is not startled into letting go his ladle and cup of sacrificial spirits:’—he makes his appearance, and maintains his ancestral temple and the altars of the spirits of the land and grain, as presiding at all sacrifices. LII. 1. Kan denotes stopping or resting-;— resting when it is the time to rest, and acting when it is the time to act. When one’s movements and restings all take place at the proper time for them, his way (of proceeding) is brilliant and intelligent. 2. Resting in one’s resting-point is resting in one’s proper place. The upper and lower (lines of the hexagram) exactly correspond to each other, but are without any interaction; hence it is said that ‘ (the subject of the hexagram) has no consciousness of self; that when he walks in his courtyard, he does not see (any of) the persons in it; and that there will be no error.’ LI. Paragraph 1. See what is said on the Text. 2. The explanations of the Thwan here are good; but in no way deduced from the figure, 3. The portion of the text printed in a different type is supposed to have dropt out of the Chinese copies. The explanation of it that follows is based on Wan’s view of Xan as representing the oldest son. See on the Text, LII, 1. The Khang-hsf editors give their opinion that what is said in the first sentence of this paragraph, after the explanation of the name, illustrates the first sentence of the Thwan, and that the other sentence illustrates the rest of the Thwan. It may be so, but the whole of the Thwan appears in paragraph 2, 2. The hexagram being made up of Kan repeated, lines x, 2,3 are of course the same as 4,5, and 6. But it will be seen that there is not a proper correlation among them all. I do not see, hex. 54. APPENDIX I. 2 57 LIII. 1. The advance indicated by Wien is (like) the marrying of a young lady which is attended by good fortune. 2. (The lines) as they advance get into their correct placesthis indicates the achievements of a successful progress. The advance is made according to correctness (the subject of the hexagram) might rectify his country. 3. Among the places (of the hexagram) we see the strong undivided line in the centre. 4. ‘In (the attributes of) restfulness and flexible penetration we have (the assurance of) an (onward) movement that is inexhaustible. LIV. 1. By Kwei Mei (the marrying away of a younger sister) the great and righteous relation between heaven and earth (is suggested to us). If heaven and earth were to have no intercommunica tion, things would not grow and flourish as they do. The marriage of a younger sister is the end (of her maidenhood) and the beginning (of her mother hood). 2. We have (in the hexagram the desire of) however, that this furnishes any ground for the entire obliviousness of self, which the Thwan makes out to be in the figure. LIII. The first sentence of paragraph 2 describes the lines from a to 5 all getting into their proper places, as has been pointed out on the Text, and that sentence is symbolical of what is said in the second. 1 The rectification of the country 1 is the reality of ‘ the successful progress.’ ' The strong undivided line ’ in paragraph 3 is the fifth of the figure. Out of rest comes movement to go on for an indefinite time, and be succeeded by rest againas says paragraph 4. 258 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. n. pleasure and, on the ground of that, movement following. The marrying away is of a younger sister. 3. ‘ Any action will be evil: ’—the places (of the lines) are not those appropriate to them. ‘ It will be in no wise advantageous: ’—the weak (third and fifth lines) are mounted on strong lines. LV. 1. Fang has the signification of being great. It is made up of the trigrams (representing) LIV. x. Kwei Mei in this Appendix has the meaning simply of marriage, and for Mei we might substitute Nii, ‘daughter’ or ‘young lady.’ This appears from the writer’s going on to point out, as elsewhere, the analogy between the growth of things in nature from the interaction of heaven and earth and the increase of mankind through marriage. He does this with a delicate touch. There is no grossness in the original any more than there is in the translation, But how are we to reconcile this reference to the action of heaven and earth with the bad auspice of the Thwan? The Khang-hsi editors felt the pressure of this difficulty, and they adduce a similar inconsistency in the account of hexagram 44 in this treatise, adding, ‘From this we may say that the interaction of the yin and yang cannot be dispensed with, but that we ought to be careful about it in the beginning in order to prevent mischief in the end. This is the doctrine of the Yi.' This is very well, but it is no solution of the difficulty. The editors could not admit that the author of the Appendix did not understand or did not deal fairly with the Text; for that author, they thought, was Confucius. 2. The same editors say that paragraph 2 implies both that the desire for the marriage originated with the lady, and that she was aware that the gentleman was older than herself. 3. The position of a divided line above an undivided is always repiesented as an evil omen; it is difficult to understand why. There is less of an appearance of reason about it than in some other things which are said about the lines. The lines are where they cannot but be from the way in which the figures were formed. HEX. 56. APPENDIX I. intelligence and movement directed by that intel ligence. It is thus that it has that signification. 2. ‘ The king has reached the condition (denoted by Fang):’—he has still to make it greater. ‘ There is no occasion to be anxious. Let him be as the sun at noon—it is for him to cause his light to shine on all under the sky. 3, When the sun has reached the meridian height, it begins to decline. When the moon has become full, it begins to wane. The (interaction of) heaven and earth is now vigorous and abundant, now dull and scanty, growing and diminishing according to the seasons.

The Khang-hsi editors remark that paragraph 1 is not so much explaining the meaning of the name Fang, as accounting for the hexagram, composed of Li and Alan, having such a meaning. Paragraph 3 seems rather contrary to the lesson of the hexa gram. According to it, prosperity cannot be maintained, any more than we can have the other seasons without winter or perpetual day without night; but the object of the essay is to exhort to the maintenance of prosperity. Is it the case that the rise of every commonwealth and cause must be followed by its decay and fall ? The mind refuses to admit the changes of the seasons, &c., as a true analogy for all moral and intellectual movements. See an important remark on the concluding sentence in the Introduction, PP- 34 . 35 - 260 the APPENDIXES. SECT. II. ponent trigrams).

It is hence said, ‘ There will -be some little attainment and progress. There will be advantage in move ment onward in whatever direction. It will be advantageous also to see the great man.’ LVI. What is said in paragraph i is intended to explain the Thwan, and not to account for the meaning of the name L Q. It is assumed that Ltl means a stranger; and the writer from the position of the fifth line, and from the attributes of the component trigrams, derives the ideas of humility, docility, a quiet restfulness, and intelligence as the characteristics proper to a stranger, and which are likely to lead to his attaining what he desires, and then advancing. LVII. I. The language of this paragraph has often occurred to me in reading commands and addresses issued by the emperors of China, such as the essays on the precepts in what is called the Sacred Edict, the reiteration employed in many of which is re markable.

When (such) pleasure goes before the people, (and leads them on), they forget their toils; when it animates them in encountering diffi culties, they forget (the risk of) death.

The feeling of pleasure going before the people and leading them on to endure toil and encounter death must be sup posed to be produced in them by the example and lessons of their ruler. Lii Fafi-hsien paraphrases this portion of the text thus - ‘ When the sage with this precedes them, he can make them endure toil without any wish to decline it, and go with him into difficulty and danger without their having any fear.’ I think this was intended to be the teaching of the hexagram, but the positive expression of it is hardly discernible.

This paragraph has been partially anticipated in the notes on the Thwan, The second line is said to suffer ‘no extinction,' because the lower trigram is that of peril. The Khang- hsi editors say that the former part of this paragraph shows how the root of the work of the hexagram is strengthened, and the latter part how the execution of that work is secured. The conclusion of paragraph 2 is, literally, 1 The king indeed is in the middle, 1 This does not mean, as some say, that the king is \\ in the middle of the temple, but that his mind or heart is exactly set on the central truth of what is right and good. The upper trigram Sun represents both wind and wood. To explain the meaning of Hwan, the significance of wind is taken; the writer here seizes on that of wood, as furnishing materials for a boat in which the great stream can be crossed. LX. Paragraph 1. See what is said on the Text of the Thwan. LXI. 1. In Wung Fu we have the (two) weak lines in the innermost part (of the figure), and strong lines occupying the central places (in the trigrams). (We have the attributes) of pleased satisfaction and flexible penetration. Sincerity (thus symbolled) will transform a country. 2. ‘ Pigs and fish (are moved), and there will be good fortune: ’—sincerity reaches to (and affects even) pigs and fishes. ‘There will be advantage in crossing the great stream: ’—(we see in the figure) one riding on (the emblem of) wood, which forms an empty boat. 3. In (the exercise of the virtue denoted by) /sfung Ffi, (it is said that) ‘ there will be advantage in being firm and correct: ’—in that virtue indeed we have the response (of man) to Heaven. ‘Its course will come to an end’ is the opposite of the intima tion in ifieh of progress and attainment. In paragraph 3 the writer returns to this intimation of the figureby the attributes of the trigrams; by the appropriate positions of lines 4 and 5; and by the central and correct place of 5. Paragraph 4 illustrates the importance of doing things according to rule by reference to the operations of nature and the enactments and institutions of sage rulers. LXI. 1. The structure of the lineal figure which is here insisted on has been pointed out in explaining the Thwan. On what is further said as to the attributes of the trigrams and their effect, Z/iangqze observes:—‘ We have in the sincerity shown in the upper trigram superiors condescending to those below them in accordance with their peculiarities, and we have in that of the lower those below delighted to follow their superiors. The com bination of these two things leads to the transformation of the country and state.’ Paragraph 2.

The weak (lines) are in the central places, and hence (it is said that what the name denotes) may be done in small affairs, and there will be good fortune. 4. Of the strong (lines one) is not in its proper place, and (the other) is not central, hence it is said that (what the name denotes) ‘ should not be done in great affairs.’ 5. (In the hexagram) we have ‘the symbol of a bird on the wing, and of the notes that come down from such a bird, for which it is better to descend than to ascend, thereby leading to great good fortune: ’—to ascend is contrary to what is reason able in the case, while to descend is natural and right. empty boat, it is said (with doubtful truth), is not liable to be upset, The trigram S un symbolises both wind and wood.

For paragraphs 1 and 2, see the note on the Text of the Thwan. It is difficult to see the concatenation in paragraph 3 between the sentiment of the Thwan and the nature of the second line, The Khang-hsi editors compare this hexagram and the next with n and 12, observing that the goodness of Thai (11) is concen trated, as here, in the second line. The sentiment of paragraph 4 is that which we have often met with,—that things move on with a constant process of change. Disorder succeeds to order, and again order to disorder.

Treatise on the Symbolism of the Hexagrams, and of the duke of Affiu's Explanations of the several Lines. Section I. I. Heaven, in its motion, (gives the idea of) strength. The superior man, in accordance with this, nerves himself to ceaseless activity. 1. ‘The dragon lies hid in the deep;—it is not the time for active doing: (this appears from) the strong and undivided line's being in the lowest place. .2. ‘The dragon appears in the field:’—the diffu sion of virtuous influence has been wide. 3. ‘ Active and vigilant all the day: ’—(this refers to) the treading of the (proper) path over and over again. 4. ‘ He seems to be leaping up, but is still in the deep: —if he advance, there will be no error. 5. ‘ The dragon is on the wing in the sky: ’—the great man rouses himself to his work. 6. ‘ The dragon exceeds the proper limits;— there will be occasion for repentance: ’—a state of fulness, that is, should not be indulged in long. 7. ‘The same undivided line is used’ (in all the places of this hexagram), but the attribute of heaven (thereby denoted) should not (always) take the foremost place. Like the Text under each hexagram, what is said under each in this treatise on its symbolism is divided into two portions. The THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX II. II. The (capacity and sustaining) power of the earth is what is denoted by Khwan. The superior man, in accordance with this, with his large virtue supports (men and) things. 1. ‘He is treading on hoarfrostthe strong ice will come (by and by): ’—-the cold (air) has begun to take form. Allow it to go on quietly according to its nature, and (the hoarfrost) will come to strong ice. 2. The movement indicated by the second line, divided, is ‘ from the straight (line) to the square.’ ‘(Its operation), without repeated effort, in every way advantageous,’ shows the brilliant result of the way of earth. 3. ‘ He keeps his excellence under restraint, but firmly maintains it:’—at the proper time he will manifest it. ‘ He may have occasion to engage in the king's service:’—great is the glory of his wisdom. first is called ‘the Great Symbolism,’ and is occupied with the trigrammatic composition of the hexagram, to the statement of which is always subjoined an exhibition of the use which should be, or has been, made of the lesson suggested by the meaning of the whole figure in the administration of affairs, or in self- government. If the treatise be rightly ascribed to Confucius, this practical application of the teaching of the symbols is eminently characteristic of his method in inculcating truth and duty; though we often find it difficult to trace the connexion between his premiss and conclusion. This portion of the treatise will be separated by a double space from what follows—‘the Lesser Symbolism,’ in the explanations of the several lines. I. A/nen is formed by redoubling the trigram of the same name, In the case of other hexagrams of similar formation, the repetition of the trigram is pointed out, That is not done here, according to M Hsf, ‘ because there is but one heaven.’ But the motion of heaven is a complete revolution every day, resumed again the next; so moves ‘the unwearied sun from day to day,’ making it a good symbol of renewed, untiring effort. HEX. 4. ‘ A sack tied upthere will be no error: ’— this shows how, through carefulness, no injury will be received. 5. ‘The yellow lower-garment;—there will be great good fortune: ’—this follows from that orna mental (colour’s) being in the right and central place. 6. ‘The dragons fight in the wild:’—the (on ward) course (indicated by Khwan) is pursued to extremity. 7. ‘(The lines are all weak and divided, as appears from) the use of the number six:’—but (those who are thus represented) becoming per petually correct and firm, there will thereby be a great consummation. II. Khwiin is formed by redoubling the trigram of the same name and having ‘the earth for its symbol.’ As in the former hexagram, the repetition is emphatic, not otherwise affecting the meaning of the hexagram, ‘ As there is but one heaven,’ says AT list, ‘so there is but one earth.’ The first part of ‘the Great Symbolism’ appears in Canon McClatchie’s version as—‘Khwan is the generative part of earth.’ By ‘generative part’ he probably means ‘ the productive or prolific faculty.’ If he mean anything else, there comes out a conclusion antagonistic to his own view of the ‘mythology’ of the Yi. The character Shi, which he trans lates by ‘generative part,’ is defined in Dr. Williams’ dictionary as ‘ the virility of males.’ Such is the special significance of it. If it were so used here, the earth would be masculine. It is difficult to say exactly what the writer meant by—‘The superior man, in accordance with this, and with his large nature, supports (men and) things.’ Lin Hst-yiian (Ming dynasty) says ‘ The superior man, in his single person, sustains the burden of all under the sky. The common people depend on him for their rest and enjoyment, Birds and beasts and creeping things, and the tribes of the vegetable kingdom, depend on him for the fulfilment of their destined being. If he be of a narrow mind and cold virtue, how can he help them ? Their hope in him would be in vain,’ ‘The Smaller Symbolism’ is sufficiently dealt with in the notes on the Text THE APPENDIXES. SECT, r. III. (The trigram representing) clouds and (that representing) thunder form Afun. The superior man, in accordance with this, ■ (adjusts his measures of government) as in sorting the threads of the warp and woof. 1. Although ‘there is a difficulty in advancing,’ the mind (of the subject of the line) is set on doing what is correct. While noble, he humbles himself to the mean, and grandly gains the people. 2. The difficulty (to the subject of) the second line, divided, arises from its place over the un divided line below it. ‘The union and children after ten years ’ shows things resuming their regular course. 3. ‘ One pursues the deer without the (guidance of the) forester: ’—(he does so) in (his eagerness to) follow the game. ‘ The superior man gives up the chase, (knowing that) if he go forward he will regret it: ’—he would be reduced to extremity. 4. ‘Going forward after such a search (for a helper)’ shows intelligence. 5. ‘ Difficulty is experienced (by the subject of the fifth line) in bestowing his rich favours:’—the extent to which they reach will not yet be con spicuous. 6, ‘He weeps tears of blood in streams:’—how can the state (thus emblemed) continue long ? III. Khan represents water, especially in the form of rain. Heie its symbol is a cloud. The whole hexagram seems to place us in the atmosphere of a thunderous sky overhung with thick and gloomy clouds, when we feel oppressed and distressed. This is not a bad emblem of the political state in the mind of the writer. When the thunder has pealed, and the clouds have discharged their HEX. 4. APPENDIX II. IV. (The trigram representing) a mountain, and beneath it that for a spring issuing forth from Mang, The superior man, in accordance with this, strives to be resolute in his conduct and nourishes his virtue. 1. ‘It will be advantageous to use punishment:’— the object being to bring under the influence of correcting law. 2. ‘A son able to (sustain the burden of) his family: ’—as appears from the reciprocation between this strong line and the weak (fifth line). 3. ‘ A woman (such as is here represented) should not be taken in marriage:—her conduct is not agreeable to what is right. 4. ‘ The regret arising from ignorance bound in chains’ is due to the special distance of (the subject of this line) from the solidity (shown in lines 2 and 6). 5. ‘The good fortune belonging to the simple lad without experience’ comes from his docility going on to humility. burden of rain, the atmosphere is cleared, and there is a feeling of relief. But I fail again to discern clearly the connexion between the symbolism and the lesson about the superior man’s admini stration of affairs. The subject of the first line of the Smaller Symbolism is repre sented by the undivided line, and therefore is firm and correct. He is noble, but his place is below the divided lines, symbols of the weak and mean (see Appendix IV, i, 1). Line 2. ‘ Things resume their regular course: ’—the subject is now at liberty to seek a union with the subject of line 5, according to the rules of the symbolism. Lines land 4, 2 and 5,3 and 6, the corresponding lines of the trigrams, are correlates. The subject of line 4 naturally recurs to the correlate in line 1. He is the natural helper in the case, and he has the ability. 272 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. r. 6. ‘Advantage will come from warding off in jury:’—(the subject of this line) above and (the ignorant) below, all do and are done to in accord ance with their nature. V.

The presence of water, however, is common to the three. But the water of the spring, or of the stream, would flow away from the hill, and not be stopped by it; as an emblem therefore of the ignorance and inexperience denoted by Mang it is not suitable. Kh. Hst says that 1 the water of a spring is sure to move on and gradually advance.’ This may serve as a symbol of the general process and progress of education, though it gives no account of the symbolism of the hill. It serves also to explain in part the transition of the writer to the subject of the superior man, and his dealing apparently with himself. Does line 1 set forth the use of punishment as the dernier resort, undesirable, but possibly unavoidable, to bring men in subjection to law? The force of line 2 comes out fully in the Thwan. That a woman such as is represented in line 3 should not be taken in marriage is clear enough; but I do not see the bearing of the illustration on the proper lesson in the hexagram. Line 3 separates 4 from 2, and 5 separates it from 6. Weak in itself, it is farther removed than any other from the two strong lines in the hexagram, and is represented as ‘cribbed’ in its ignorance. The fifth is the most honourable place in the figure, and here is occupied by a weak line. This looks, however, to the occupant of line 2, less honourable than itself, and is marked by the two attri butes that are named. Compare what is said on line 2. A strong line in the topmost place must represent, according to the scheme of the hexagram, one who uses force in the cause of education; but the force is put forth not on the ignorant, but on t ose who would keep them ignorant, or increase their ignorance. The subject of this line, therefore, acts according to his nature, and the subjects of all the weak lines below are cared for as is best lor them. HEX. 5 . APPENDIX IT. 273 for the sky forms Hsu. The superior man, in accordance with this, eats and drinks, feasts and enjoys himself (as if there were nothing else to employ him). 1. ‘He is waiting in the (distant) border:’—-he makes no movement to encounter rashly the diffi culties (of the situation). ‘ It will be advantageous for him constantly to maintain (the purpose thus shown), in which case there will be no error: ’—he will not fail to pursue that regular course. 2. ‘ He is waiting on the sand: ’—he occupies his position in the centre with a generous forbearance. Though 1 he suffer the small injury of being spoken (against),’ he will bring things to a good issue. 3. ‘ He is waiting in the mud: ’—calamity is (close at hand, and as it were) in the outer (trigram). ‘He himself invites the approach of injuryif he be reverent and careful, he will not be worsted. 4. ‘He is waiting in (the place of) blood:’—he accommodates himself (to the circumstances of the time), and hearkens to (its requirements). 5. ‘ The appliances of a feast, and the good for tune through being firm and correct,’ are indicated by (the position in) the central and correct place. 6. ‘Guests come unurged (to give their help), and if (the subject of the line) receive them respectfully, there will be good fortune in the end: though the occupant and the place are not suited to each other, there has been no great failure (in what has been done).

(The trigram representing) heaven and (that representing) water, moving away from each other, form Sung. The superior man, in accordance with this, in the transaction of affairs takes good counsel about his first steps. 1. 'He does not perpetuate the matter about which (the contention is): ’—contention should not be prolonged. Although ' he may suffer the small (injury) of being spoken against,’ his argument is clear. 2. ‘He is unequal to the contention; he retires and keeps concealed, stealthily withdrawing from it: ’—for him from his lower place to contend with (the stronger one) above, would be to (invite) cala mity, as if he brought it with his hand to himself. 3. ‘ He confines himself to the support assigned and earth, to discharge its store of rain.’ This gives to the writer the idea of waiting; and the superior man is supposed to be taught by this symbolism to enjoy his idle time, while he is waiting for the approach of danger and occasion for action. ‘ The regular course ’ of the subject of line 1 seems to be the determination to wait, at a distance from danger, the proper time to act. The subject of line 2, which is undivided and in the centre, is thereby shown to be possessed of a large and generous for bearance. The recognition of the circumstances of the time, and hearken ing to its requirements, explain, in paragraph 4, ‘ the retreat from the cavern,’ which is not here repeated from the Text. The line being weak and divided, its subject knows his own incompetency, and takes this prudent step. Kt says that he does not understand what is said under line 6 ,— that the occupant and the place are not suited to each other, for the yin line being in the .sixth, an even place, seems to be where it ought to be. We are only surprised that cases of inconsistency in these explanations are not more numerous, to him of old: ’—(thus) following those above him, he will have good fortune. 4. 1 He returns to (the study of Heaven’s) ordi nances, changes (his wish to contend), and rests in being firm and correct: ’—he does not fail (in doing what is right). 5. 'He contendsand with great fortune:’— this is shown by his holding the due mean and being in the correct place. 6. ‘ He receives the robe through his conten tion : ’—but still he is not deserving of respect. VII. (The trigram representing) the earth and in the midst of it that representing water, form Sze. The superior man, in accordance with this, nourishes and educates the people, and collects (from among them) the multitudes (of the hosts). 1. ‘The host goes forth according to the rules (for) such a movement: ’—if those rules be not ob served, there will be evil. VI, The symbolism here is different from that in the Text of the Thwan. We have the visible sky ascending and water or rain descending, which indicate, one hardly sees how, opposidon and contention, The lesson as to the course of the superior man is a good one, but might with equal propriety be deduced from many other hexagrams. Hsiang An-shih (Sung dynasty) says that the first part of para graph 2 is all to be taken as the language of the duke of Jau, the characters being varied j the rest is the remark of the writer of this treatise. It is observed that the returning to (the study of Heaven s) ordi nances, and changing the wish to contend, in paragraph 4, are not two things, but only one; ‘the ordinances (ming) meaning what is right in principle.’ The wish to contend was wrong in principle, and is now abandoned. 1 The robe ’ takes the place of ‘the leathern sash in paragraph 6; but the sash was merely an appendage of the robe. THE APPENDIXES. 2. ‘ He is in the midst of the host, and there will be good fortune: ’—he has received the favour of Heaven. ‘The king has thrice conveyed to him the orders (of) his favour: ’—(the king) cherishes the myriad regions in his heart. 3. ‘The host with the possibility of its having many idle leaders:’—great will be its want of success. 4. ‘The host is in retreat; but there is no error:’ —there has been no failure in the regular course. 5. ‘ The oldest son leads the host: ’—its move ments are directed by him in accordance with his position in the centre. ‘ Younger men idly occupy their positions: ’—the employment of -such men is improper. 6. ‘The great ruler delivers his charges:’— thereby he rightly apportions merit. ‘ Small men should not be employed: ’—they are sure to throw the states into confusion. VII. The Great Symbolism' here is not more satisfactory than in other paragraphs of it which have already come before us. KtH Hsi says‘ As the water is not outside the earth, so soldiers are not outside the people. Therefore if (a ruler) be able to nourish the people, he can get the multitudes (of his hosts).’ Is the meaning this,—that originally the people and soldiers are one body; that a portion of the people are taken out from among the mass, as occasion requires, to do the duty of soldiers; and that the nourish ment and education of the people is the best way to have good soldiers ready for use on any emergency? Compare the saying of Confucius in Analects XIII, xxx. What is said on the second line, that the general ‘ has received the favour of Heaven,' refers of course to the entire confidence reposed m him by the ruler or king, the subject of line 5. In this way. hien here is equal to Thien wang, so frequent in the bpring and Autumn,' and meaning—' King by the grace of HEX. 8. APPENDIX II. 2 77 VIII.

The ancient kings, in accordance with this, established the various states and maintained an affectionate relation to their princes. 1.

But the great powers given to the general are from the king’s wish through him to promote the good of all the nation.. In military operations there must be one ruling will and mind. A divided authority is sure to be a failure. But ‘ a retreat is no evidence of failure in a campaign. When advance would lead to disaster, retreat is the regular course to pursue.

What is said about the ancient kings is more pertinent to the meaning of the hexagram than in many other applications in ‘ the Great Symbolism.’ The king appears in it not only as the centre, but as the cause, of union. ‘The other advantages' under line 1 refer to all the benefits that will result from sincerity and union, which are in themselves good. It is hardly possible to make what is said under line 5, on the royal huntings, agree with the account of them given on the same Ime m the duke of Ziu’s text. I suspect that there is some corruption of the text. The two verbs ‘neglecting' and ‘taking’ seem to be used, the one for the other. HEX. 9.

IX. The suitability of the symbolism here is made all to turn on the wind. ‘ Wind,’ says Zu, 1 is simply the air, without solid sub stance ; it can restrain, but not for long.’ The wind moves in the sky for a time, and then ceases. The process of thought from the symbol to the lesson is not easily traced. Is it meant to say that virtue manifesting itself outwardly—-in the carriage and speech—is, however good, but a small matter, admirable in an officer, or even a feudal lord, but that we look for more in a king, the Head of a nation? KJ& ng-^ze calls attention to the addition to the duke ol Zau’s explanation in the notice on line 2, that ‘ it is in the central place, adding that this explains how the subject of the line restrains him self, and does not go beyond what is due from him. Only half of the symbolism in the Text of line 3 is taken up here. Line 1, it is said, is far from line 4, the mauvais sujet of the hexagram, and little affected by it; line 2 is nearer, but,being in the centre, suffers little; line 3 is close on it, and, not being in the centre, comes under its evil influence; while line 6 gives no hep. Line 4 is weak, and in an even place, appropriate to it; and hence its subject is said to ‘ have sincerity.' Being the first line, moreover, of Sun, the two others take their character from it, Line 5, being undivided, and occupying the most important place in the figure, according to the value usually attached to the lines, is i 280 THE APPENDIXES.

But it is true that the members of a community or nation must keep their several places and duties in order to its being in a state of good order. For lines 1,2, 3, and 4, see notes on the Text. If we might translate the conclusion of what is said on line 5, by—‘in the position that is correctly appropriate to him, the meaning would be more clear, though still the assumption which I have pointed out on the Text would underlie the statement; and as evidently as there, what is said under line 6 is but a truism.

There is no opportunity of conferring on him the glory of emolument. XI. It is difficult to translate the application of ' the Great Sym bolism' here, so that it shall be intelligible to a reader. A 7 /ang-jze says:—‘A ruler should frame his laws and regulations so that the people may avail themselves of the seasons of heaven, and of the advantages afforded by the earth, assisting their transforming and nourishing services, and completing their abundant and admirable benefits. Thus the breath of spring, calling forth all vegetable life, gives the law for sowing and planting; the breath of autumn, completing and solidifying all things, gives the law for ingathering and storing,’ ' \" The subject of line 1 has 1 his will on what is external to him self : —he is bent on going forward. ■Kt Hsf explains what is said on paragraph 4, that the upper lines , 1 are out of their real place where they are,' or, literally, ‘ have lost their substantiality,’ by the remark that«their proper place, as being weak lines, is below.’ The editors of the imperial edition prefer another explanation, on which I need not enter. HEX. 12. APPENDIX II. 1. ‘The good fortune through firm goodness, (suggested by) the pulling up of the grass,’ arises from the will (of the parties intended) being bent on (serving) the ruler. 2. ‘ The great man, comporting himself as the distress and obstruction require, will have success:’— he does not allow himself to be disordered by the herd (of small men). 3. That ‘his shame is folded in his breast’ is owing to the inappropriateness of his position. 4. ‘ He acts in accordance with the ordination (of Heaven), and commits no error;’—the purpose of his mind can be carried into effect. 5. ‘The good fortune of the great man’ arises from the correctness of his position. 6. ‘ The distress and obstruction having reached its end, it is overthrown and removed—how could it be prolonged ? XII. ‘ The Great Symbolism’ here is sufficiently explained in the first Appendix. The application, however, is here again difficult, though we may try to find in it a particular instance of the inter ruption of communication,—in great merit not meeting with its reward. The subject of the first line is one of the cluster of small men who are able to change their mind, and set their hearts to love their ruler. The subject of the second line is a ‘ great man,’ and occupies the place in the centre. The subject of the third line is weak, and does not occupy his correct position;—hence the symbolism. The fourth line is near the fifth, the ruler’s place. It is a strong line in an even place; but acting according to the will of Heaven or of the ruler, its subject gets his purpose carried out. The subject of the fifth line is the great man, the ruler in his right place. Hence he is successful, and in the last line, we see THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX II. XIII.

It was in the order of change that they should do so. XIII.

For line 5, see note on the Text, The Khang-hst editors append the following note to the last paragraphUnder line x it is said that “union in the open country indicates progress and success,\" while here it is only said that “ with union in the suburbs there is no cause for repentance. Beyond the suburbs was the open country, and till the union reached so far, the object of the hexagram was not attained. We may truly say that Confucius was a skilful reader of the duke of jST&u?

The earth is low, and in the midst of it is a high mountain; but I fail to see how this can symbolise humility. Nor does Regis’ representation of it much improve the case:— c Monte ’ (ait glossa) ' nihil est altius in terra, quae est sumrne abjecta. At cum is de- clivis sit, imago esse potest humilis modestiae.’ I find the following note on the paragraph in my copy of the ‘Daily Lessons’ (see Pre- faee);— f The five yin lines above and below symbolise the earth; the one yang line in the centre is “ the mountain in the midst of the earth.” The many yin lines represent men’s desires; the one yang line, heavenly principle. The superior man, looking at this symbolism, diminishes the multitude of human desires within him, and increases the single shoot of heavenly principle; so does he become grandly just, and can deal with all things evenly according to the nature of each. In whatever circumstances or place he is, he will do what is right,’ This is certainly very ingenious, but one shrinks from accepting a view that is not based on the component trigrams. Under line x, ‘ nourishes his (virtue)’ is,literally, ‘pastures him self.’ He is all humility. That makes him what he is. Under line 4, ‘ the (proper) rule’ is the rule proper for the subject of the line in his circumstances so near the place of the ruler. Under line 5, ‘ the refusal to submit makes an appeal to force necessary. Even the best and humblest ruler bears the sword, and must not bear it in vain. , I'd Hsi bases all that is said under line 6 on its being a weak line; so that the humble ruler is unable even at the close of the action described in the figure to accomplish all his objects, and must limit his field even in appealing to arms.

The use of music at sacrifices, however, as assisting the union produced by those services between God and his wor shippers, and the present and past generations, agrees with the general idea of the figure.

Neither the symbolism, however, nor its application adds much to our understanding of the text, Paragraph 1 consists of two lines that rhyme; and paragraphs 4 (two lines), 5, and 6 do the same. According to Kh Yen-wu, paragraphs 2 and 3 also rhyme; but this appears to me doubtful. The symbolism of these paragraphs is sufficiently explained in the notes on the Text.

The Shang hai editors, wishing to defend the explanation of lin by ‘great/ in Appendix VI, which they ascribe to Confucius, say:—‘Lin means “great.” The earth above the waters of the marsh shows how full those waters are, rising to the level of the earth, and thus expressing the idea of greatness.' This representation is lame and impotent. ATh Hsi says he does not understand what is said on line 2. The interpretation in my version is the ordinary one, but I am not satisfied with it. The Khang-hst editors try to solve the difficulty; but I am not able to follow them. The same editors compare the conclusion of paragraph 6 in the symbolism of hexagram n, ‘ What is external 1 there, and 1 what is interna] here, have, they say, the same reference,—the state, namely, of the whole kingdom, the expressions differing according to the different standpoints from which they are made.

The various processes of government are small matters, and elegance and orna ment help their course; but great matters of judgment demand the simple, unornamented truth.’ The subject of line 1 does not care for and does not need orna ment.

Notwithstanding ‘the perilous position of him other hand, Lift Mft (early in the Sung dynasty) saysA moun tain has the earth for its foundation. If the earth be thick, the mountain preserves its height. So it is with the sovereign and people.’ The application might be deduced from either view. It is hard to tell whether ‘the lowest' in paragraph 1 should be supplemented as I have done. If not, then the explanation is a mere truism, A^ang-jze is precise and decisive in supplementing the explana tion of paragraph 2 as in the translation. See on the Text of lines 3 and 4. On paragraph 5, the Khang-hs! editors say admirably‘ The fifth line is weak, and yet occupies the most honourable place in the figure,—emblematic of a queen; and as its subject leads on the subjects of the other lines to obtain the favours given to the inmates of the palace, she, it is plain, has neither jealousy nor any other injurious temper that might incur blame for tending to overthrow the ruler.' Paragraph 6 shows the ruler restored to the favour of the people, and the restoration of concord in the state.

XXIV. ‘Thunder in the midst of the earth’ is thunder shut up and silent, just able to make its presence felt. So is it with the first genial stirrings of life after the winter solstice; so is it with the first returning steps of the wanderer to virtue. As the spring of life has to be nursed in quietness, so also has the purpose of good, The ancient statutes here referred to must have been like the present cessation from public and private business at the time of the new year, when all the Chinese people are for a time dissolved in festivity and joy. Canon McClatchie translates here‘ The ancient kings on this culminating day (i. e. the seventh) closed their gates,’ &c. ‘ Cul minating day' does not give us the meaning so well as 1 the day of the solstice; but where does the translator find the explanatory the seventh/ which he puts in parentheses ? In my own ‘ salad’ days of Chinese knowledge I fancied there might be in paragraph 1 of the Text some allusion to a primitive sabbath; but there is no ground for introducing ‘ seven days,’ or ‘ the seventh day/ into this paragraph of the Great Symbolism. ‘ The v ‘rtuous subject of the first line’ is in paragraph 2 called siin, the benevolent or ‘loving/ It is the only case in all the symbolism of the Yt where we find that term used as an adjective. It is emphatic here for ‘ humanity/ man in his ideal. e othei paragraphs present nothing for remark beyond what has been said on the Text of the duke of ATdu. HEX. 23. APPENDIX II. 299 XXV. The thunder rolls all under the sky, and to (every)thing there is given (its nature), free from all insincerity. The ancient kings, in accordance with this, (made their regulations) in complete accordance with the seasons, thereby nourishing all things. 1. When ‘he who is free from insincerity makes any movement,’ he will get what he desires. 2. ‘He reaps without having ploughed:’—(the thought of) riches to be got had not risen (in his mind). 3. ‘The passer-by gets the ox; 5 —this proves a calamity to the people of the neighbourhood. 4. * If he can remain firm and correct there will be no errorhe firmly holds fast (his correctness). 5. ‘ Medicine in the case of one who is free from insincerity! ’—it should not be tried (at all). 6. * The action (in this case) of one who is free from insincerity’ will occasion the calamity arising from action (when the time for it is) exhausted. XXV. The composition of the hexagram is given here in a manner different from what we have met with in the account of any of the preceding figures; and as the text is not called in ques tion, I have made the best I could in the translation of the two commencing clauses. The application of the symbolism to what the ancient kings did is also hard to comprehend. The paragraph on line 1 is another way of saying that in the course of things real goodness may be expected to be fortunate,- ‘ by the appointment of Heaven.’ Paragraph 2. 1 The thought of getting rich had not risen in his mind: —he did what he did, because it was right, not because of the gain it would bring him. .......

XXVIII. Kh ang-jze says on the Great Symbolism 1 The waters of a marsh moisten and nourish the trees. When here it is said that they destroy and extinguish the trees, their action is very extraordinary.’ This explanation is very far-fetched; and so is what the same scholar says on the application of it. I need not give it here, nor have I found, or myself made out, any other more easy and natural. Paragraph a. 'Such an association is extraordinary:’-the characters also imply, perhaps, that it is successful. . Paragraph 3.

This symbolism agrees sufficiently well with the idea of influence passing between a superior and inferior party in relation with each other. There is nothing in the representation, however, to suggest particularly the relation between husband and wife; and the more I think of it, the more doubtful it becomes to me that king Wan intended by the trigrams of this figure to give the idea of man and wife. The application of the symbolism is sufficiently appropriate. The commentators see in it especially the lesson of humility- emptiness of self, or poverty of spirit—in order that the influences to which we are subjected may have free course. Paragraph 1. What is beyond one’s self is represented by line 4, a proper correlate of 1, There is the desire to influence; but it is ineffectively exhibited, _ Paragraph 2. ‘Compliance (with the circumstances of his con dition and place)’ is merely another way of ‘being Arm and correct.’ Paragraph 3. The language, ‘ What he holds in his grasp is low,’ makes Jfu Hsi and the older commentators generally understand low of lines r and 2, and their weak subjects. But ‘ following ’ leads the mind to the lines above, as the Khang-hst editors point out. ‘Low’ is to be understood in the sense of ‘ mean.’ Paragraph 4, The ‘being firm and correct’ appears here as equivalent to the want of ‘ a selfish wish to influence.’ Paragraph 5, The triviality of the aim explains the ineffective ness of the movement, but not its giving no occasion for repent ance. That the mei which are moved are behind and above the region of the heart seems too mechanical and trivial an explanation. hex. 32. APPENDIX II. XXXII.

The symbolism of the various lines is sufficiently explained on the Text. Paragraph 5 is but a repetition of the Text without additional explanation. XXXIV. In illustration of the symbolism of the trigrams here, Khh\\%-m says well Thunder rolling above in the #ky and making all things shake is the emblem of great power.’ In passing on to its application he starts with a beautiful saying of antiquity, that ‘the strong man is he who overcomes himself. That this thought was in the mind of the writer of the paragraph on the Great Symbolism I can well believe; but the analogy be ween the natural and the moral and spiritual worlds in passing from th phenomenon of thunder to this truth is a thing to be felt, and that can hardly be described.

There is nothing said on line 2 to explain particularly the sym bolism of ‘ the grandmother’ in the Text. ‘The course of procedure’ in paragraph 6 has still an element of force in it, which is more to 'the far correctness that was to king W 5 n the ideal character of a feudal lord, and therefore his light is not yet that of the full-orbed sun.

XXXVII. The Symbolism here is certainly far-fetched. ‘As wind,’ it is said, ‘ comes first from fire, so does transforming influ ence emanate from the family.' But the subject of the hexagram is the regulation and not the influence of the family. Then the application is good for the superior man’s cultivation of himself ; but this again is only connected indirectly with the regulation of the family. The sooner preventive measures are presented to the youthful mind the better; but does not prohibition imply that a change in the good will has taken place ? In paragraph 2 1 docility' is suggested by the weak line. The humility ’ conies out of Sun, the upper trigram, whose attribute is pliant flexibility. Yii Yen (Yflan dynasty) ingeniously observes on paragraph 4 that the riches of a family are not to be sought in its wealth, but in the affection and harmony of its members. Where these pre vail, the family is not likely to be poor, and whatever it has will be well preserved. The mention ‘of mutual love’ is unusual in Chinese writings, and must he considered remarkable here. ‘The husband, says jT/iang-tze, ‘ loves his helpmate in the house; the wife loves him ,,ho is the pattern for the family.’ But bower admtrable the sentiment is, it comes from the mind of the ivnter, and is not drawn from the Text. , , .

The strong (fourth) line and the weak line here are in correlationwe judge rightly in saying that ‘ its subject will commit no error.’ 2. ‘The good fortune springing from the firm correctness of the second line, undivided/ is due to its subject holding the due mean. 3. For ‘a porter with his burden to be riding in a carriage’ is a thing to be ashamed of. ‘ It is he himself that tempts the robbers to come:’—on whom besides can we lay the blame ? (See Appendix III, i, 48,) 4. ‘ Remove your toes: ’—the places (of this line is water; each of the two trigrams is an emblem of perilousness, There is peril, both above and below, in the figure; and lienee it represents the difficulties of the state.’ The application of the symbolism is illustrated by the words of Mencius, ‘ When we do not, by what we do, realise (what we desire), we must turn inwards and examine ourselves in every point.’ From the lesson in paragraph 2 we saw that the moral value of conduct is independent of failure or success. It is said, ‘ Though the difficulties be too great for him to overcome, the sage accepts his desire, in order to stimulate others to loyal devotedness,’ On paragraph 3, Khung Ying-td says:— 1 Of the three lines of the lower trigram only the third is yang, above the two others which are of the yin nature. They cling to it, and are repre sented as if rejoicing in it. The view given of paragraph 4 is that of the Khang-hst editors. The friends in paragraph 5 are the subjects of the second line, the correlate of 5, and also of the two other lines of the lower trigram. .

The superior man, in accordance with this, restrains his wrath and represses his desires. 1. ‘ He suspends his own affairs and hurries away (to help the subject of the fourth line):’—the (sub ject of that) upper (line) mingles his wishes with his. XL, It is a common saying that thunder and rain clear the atmosphere, and a feeling of oppression is relieved. Ihe last paragraph of Appendix I, however, leads us to understand the Symbolism of the phenomena of spring. I he application seems to refer to the gentle policy of a conqueror forward to forgive the opposition of those who offer no more resistance. The subject of line 2 is a minister or officer; and the Khang-hst editors say that while straightforwardness, symbolised by the ariow, is the first duty of an officer, if he do not temper that quality by pursuing the due medium, which is symbolised by the yellow colour of the arrow, but proceed by main force, and that only, to remove what is evil, he will provoke indignation and rebellion. The ■' three foxes 1 are not alluded to in this second paragiaph. On paragraph 4 the same editors say:—‘The subject of this line is not in the central nor in an odd place; he has for his correlate the subject of line 1 and for his close associate that of line 3, both of which lines are weak in strong places.^ Hence it is said, that they are all in places inappropriate to them. What paragraph 5 says, that ‘the small men retire, means that believing in the sincerity of the ruler's determination to remove a evil men, they retire of themselves, or strive to conform to his wishes. THE APPENDIXES. 2. 1 It will be advantageous for (the subject of) the second line, undivided, to maintain his firm correctness: ’—his central position gives its character to his aim. 3. ‘ One man, walking,’ (finds his friend)when three are together, doubts rise among them. 4. ‘He diminishes the ailment under which he labours: ’—this is matter for joy. 5. ‘ The great good fortune attached to the fifth line, divided,’ is due to the blessing from above. 6. ‘He gives increase to others without taking from what is his own: ’—he obtains his wish on a grand scale. XLI. 1 The waters of a marsh are continually rising up in vapour to bedew the hill above it, and thus increase its verdure; what is taken from the marsh gives increase to the hill/ This is very far-fetched. In the application again the superior man acts only on himself, and for himself 5—which has nothing to do with those of low degree giving to those above them, This application, how ever, agrees with what, as we have seen on the Text, was KB ng- p's view of the meaning of the hexagram. The explanation appended to paragraph 1 seems to be to account for the subject of line 1 hurrying away to the help of line 4. ‘ His aim’ is to abide where he is, and help the subject of 5 by the exhibition of ‘ firm correctness/ The Khang-hst editors observe that paragraph 3 is true indeed of three men; and not of three men only, but of many repetitions of thought or action. 1 he same editors say on paragraph 5 that ' the blessing from above is explained, by many, of the oracles obtained through divining with the tortoise-shell; but that looking at the text on line 2 of the next hexagram, and that Ti (spoken of there) is the lord of all spirits, the term “above\" here is most naturally explained of Heaven s mind, whose acceptance cannot be gainsaid by men or spirits/ Z/iSng-jze says on paragraph 6, though I do not see the rele- HEX. 42.

The superior man, in accord ance with this, when he sees what is good, moves towards it; and when he sees his errors, he turns from them. 1. ‘If the movement be greatly fortunate, no blame will be imputed to him:’—though it is not for one in so low a position to have to do with great affairs. 2. ‘Parties add to his stores:’—they come from beyond (his immediate circle) to do so. 3. ‘ Increase is given by means of what is evil and difficult:’—as he has in himself (the qualities called forth). 4. ‘His advice to his prince is followed :’—his (only) object in it being the increase (of the general good). 5. 1 (The ruler) with sincere heart seeks to benefit (all below): ’—there need be no question (about the result). ‘ (All below) with sincere heart acknowledge (his goodness):’—he gets what he desires on a great scale. 6. ‘To his increase none will contribute: this expresses but half the result. ‘ Many will seek to assail him:’—they will come from beyond (his immediate circle) to do so. vancy of his remarks‘ Dwelling on high, and taking nothing from those below him, but on the contrary giving more to them, the superior man accomplishes his aim on a grand scale. 1 w aim of the superior man is simply to be increasing what others have;—that and nothing else/ XLII.

The superior man, in accordance with this, bestows emolument on those below him, and dislikes allowing his gifts to accumulate (undls- pensed). 1. ‘Without (being able to) succeed, he goes forward: ’—this is an error. 2. ‘Though hostile measures be taken against him, he need not be anxious;’—he pursues the course of the due mean. 3. ‘The superior man looks bent on cutting off the culprit:’—there will in the end be no error. 4. ‘ He walks slowly and with difficulty: ’—he is not in the place appropriate to him. ‘He hears these words, but does not believe them: ’—he hears, but does not understand. 5. 1 If his action be in harmony with his central it more commonly does, wind. Thunder and wind, it is sup posed, increase each the other; and their combination gives the idea of increase- Then the application, good in itself, must be treated very nicely, as it is by the Khang-hsi editors, in order to make out any connexion between it and the Symbolism. Paragraph 1, ‘ One in a low position should not move in great affairs; —not a son, it is said, while his father is alive; nor a min* istei, while his ruler governs; nor a member of an official depart ment, while its head directs its affairs. If such a one do initiate such an affair, only great success will excuse his rashness. Paragiaph 2. Line 5 is the proper correlate of 2; and its subject will be among the contributing parties.

We can only understand the mounting of the waters of a marsh up into the sky of the phenomenon of evaporation; and certainly the waters so formed into clouds will be condensed, and come down again as rain, This may be taken as an image of dispersion, but not of displacement in the sense of the Text of the hexagram. The first clause of the application follows naturally enough from the above interpretation of the Symbolism, Wfi LIsi says he does not understand the second clause. Many critics adopt the view of it which appears in the translation. Paragraph 2 does not mention the precautionary measures taken in the Text by the subject of the line, from which the conclusion would follow quite as naturally as from his central position. The Khang-hsi editors, however, say that the not having recourse lightly to force is itself the due course. Line 3 responding, and alone of all the strong lines responding to 6, may appear at first irresolute, and not prepared for decided measures; but ‘in the end' its subject does what is required of him. The contiguity of line g to the divided 6, is supposed to have some bad effect on its subject, so that while he does what his central position requires, it is not without an effort ‘If a man,’ says jOang-jze, ‘cherish a single illicit desire in his mind, he has left the right way. The admonition here conveyed is deep. THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX II.

XLIV, Wind, blowing all-under the sky, penetrates everywhere, and produces its natural effect ; and it is a good application of this phenomenon that follows; but it has nothing to do with the meaning of Kau and the interpretation of the hexagram, as taught in the Text, The Khang-hsi editors perceive this, and deal with the Symbolism after a method of their own, on which it is unne cessary to enter, Paragraph 1. My supplement,' This describes the arrest of/ k a conclusion from the whole of the Text on the line. All the com mentaries have it. In the ‘ Daily Lecture’ it is said that the lesson of paragraph 3 is that 1 the subject of the line should make the repression of 1 his own exclusive work, and not allow it to pass on to the subject of any of the other lines.’ That view is rather different from the one indicated in my supplement. ‘ His steps have not been drawn into the course of the first HEX. 4 g.

The superior man, in accordance with this, has his weapons of war put in good repair, to be prepared against unforeseen contingencies. 1. ‘ In consequence disorder is brought into the sphere of his union: ’—his mind and aim are thrown into confusion. 2. 1 He is led forward; there will be good fortune, and freedom from error:’—(the virtue proper to) his central place has not undergone any change. 3. ‘If he go forward, he will not err:’—in the subject of the topmost line there is humility and condescension. 4. ‘ If he be grandly fortunate, he will receive no blame:’—(this condition is necessary, because) his position is not the one proper to him, 5. ‘ There is the union (of all) under him in the place of dignity: ’—(but) his mind and aim have not yet been brilliantly displayed. line:’—we have to supply, ‘and therefore there will be no great error.’ Paragraph 4. See what is said on the Text. But that the subject of the line stands alone is owing, it is here implied, to his own impatience. If he could exercise forbearance, he would find a proper opportunity to check the advance of the subject of line 1. The subject of line g, while mindful of his task in the hexagiam, to repress the advance symbolised by 1,—yet keeps his wise plans concealed till the period of carrying them into execution, deter mined by the ordinances of Heaven, has arrived, Then comes the successful stroke of his policy as if it were directly from Heaven. The subject of line 6 really accomplishes nothing to repress the advance of the unworthy; but he keeps himself from evil commu nication with them. He is not to be charged with blameable error, though more and better might have been expected of him. THE APPENDIXES.

XLV. What has this Great Symbolism to do with the idea and preservation of union? The question is answered in this way:— A marsh whose waters are high up above the earth must be kept in by banks and dykes, to keep them together, to preserve them from being dispersed, So the union of a people must be preserved by precautions against what would disturb and destroy it. Of such pre cautions the chief is to be prepared to resist attack from without, and to put down internal sedition. Paragraph 3. The topmost line is the last in Tui, whose attri bute is complacent satisfaction, appearing in flexibility or docility. Paragraph g. ‘ His mind and aim have not yet been brilliantly displayed:—this is in explanation of the case that some may even still not have confidence in him. Paragraph 6. The topmost position is that of the trigram; the subject of the line might bid farewell to all the work of the hexa gram ; but he cannot bear to do so. HEX. 47 , 5. ‘ He is firmly correct, and will therefore enjoy good fortune.

XLVII. (The trigram representing) a marsh, and (below it that for a defile, which has drained the other dry so that there is) no water in it, form Khwan. The superior man, in accordance with this, will sacrifice his life in order to carry out his purpose. 1, ‘He enters a dark valley:’—so benighted is he, and without clear vision. 2. ‘He is straitened amidst his wine and viands: ’—(but) his position is central, and there will be ground for congratulation. XLVI. See what has been said on the Great Symbolism in Appendix I. The application which is made of it here may be accepted, though it has nothing to do with the teaching of the Text about the gradual rise of a good officer to high social distinc tion and influence. Paragraph 1. Instead of finding in this the three lines of Khwan and their subjects, AHng-jze makes ‘the upper' denote only line 2. Paragraph 2. The subject of line 2 in his loyal devotion to 5 will do much good and benefit many; hence we have the words, 1 affords occasion for joy.' Paragraph 3. ‘ He has no doubt or hesitation: ’-but this is pre suming rather on his strength. Paragraph 4. . The Khang-hsi editors say:—‘ Such an employ ment of men of worth to do service to spiritual Beings is serving them according to their mind.’ _ Paragraph 6. When one has reached the greatest height, he should think of retiring. Ambition otherwise may overleap itself. THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX II. 3. 'He lays hold of thorns:’—(this is suggested by the position of the line) above the strong (line). ‘ He enters his palace, and does not see his wife;’—this is inauspicious. 4.

Although he is not in his appropriate place, he and that other will (in the end) be together. 5. ‘ His nose and feet are cut offV—his aim has not yet been gained. ‘ He is leisurely, however, in his movements, and is satisfied: ’—his position is central and (his virtue) is correct. ‘ It will be well for him to be (as sincere as) in sacrificing: ’—so shall he receive blessing. 6. ' He is straitened as if bound with creepers:’— (his spirit and action) are unsuitable. ‘(He says), \"If I move, I shall repent of it.” And he does repent (of former errors), which leads to good fortune: ’—so he (now) goes on. XLVII. The first sentence of the Great Symbolism is constructed differently from any which has presented itself in the previous 46 hexagrams. Literally translated, it would be ‘a marsh with no water is Khwan;’ and this might certainly suggest to us a con dition of distress. But how does this come out of the trigrams? The upper one is Tui, representing a marsh; and the lower is Khan, representing water in a defile. The collocation of the two suggests the running of the water from the marsh or lake into the stream, which will soon empty the other. Such is the view which occurred to myself; and it is the same as that given by ATi Hst:—‘The water descending and leaking away, the marsh above will become dry,’ The application is good in itself, but the con catenation between it and the Symbolism is hardly discernible. HEX. 48. XLVIII. (The trigram representing) wood and above it that for water form 3 ing. The superior man, in accordance with this, comforts the people, and stimulates them to mutual helpfulness. 1. ' A well so muddy that men will not drink of it; ’—this is indicated by the low position (of the line). ‘ An old well to which the birds do not come: it has been forsaken in the course of time. 2. ‘A well from which by a hole the water escapes, and flows away to the shrimps:’—(the subject of this second line has) none co-operating with him (above). 3. ‘The well has been cleared out, but is not used: ’—(even) passers-by would be sorry for this. A prayer is made ‘that the king were intelli gent : ’—for then blessing would be received. 4. ‘ A well the lining of which is well laid. There will be no error: ’—the well has been put in good repair. 5. ‘The waters from the cold spring are (freely) drunk: -this is indicated by the central and correct position (of the line). 6. ‘ The great good fortune ’ at the topmost place So stupid is the subject of line 1 that by his own act he increases his distress. The Khang-hst editors say that the ‘ground for congratulation in paragraph 2 is the banqueting and sacrificing.’ I rather think it is the measure of. help, which it is intimated the subject will give in removing the straitness and distress of the time. See the extract from the Khang-hst editors on the symbolism of the third line of the Text. The difficulties attending the symbolism of the Text of lines 4, 5, and 6 are not lightened by what we find in this Appendix. 3 s8 THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX II. indicates the grand accomplishment (of the idea in the hexagram). XLIX. (The trigram representing the waters of) a marsh and that for fire in the midst of them form Ko. The superior man, in accordance with this, regulates his (astronomical) calculations, and makes clear the seasons and times. 1. ‘He is bound with (the skin of) a yellow ox:’—he should in his circumstances be taking action. 2. ‘He makes his changes when some time has passed: ’—what he does will be matter of admira tion. 3. ‘The change (contemplated) .has been three times fully discussed: —to what else should atten tion (now) be directed ? 4. ‘The good fortune consequent on changing (existing) ordinances ’ is due to the faith reposed in his aims. 5. ‘The great man produces his changes as the tiger does when he changes his stripes:’—their beauty becomes more brilliant. XLVIII. The Great Symbolism here may well enough represent a well, it being understood that the water which is above the wood is that raised by it for irrigation and other uses. What is said, moreover, in the application is more akin to the idea of the hexa gram than in most of the other cases, It is certainly one way in which the ruler should nourish the people. It is said on paragraph 1‘ Those who have a mind to do something in the world, when they look at this line, and its sym bolism, will learn how they ought to exert themselves/ Rather in opposition to what I have said on the Text of line 4, the ‘ Daily Lecture ' observes here‘ The cultivation of one’s self, which is represented here, is fundamental to the government of others.’ HEX. 50. 6. ‘The superior man produces his changes as the leopard does when he changes his spots: ’—their beauty becomes more elegant. ‘Small men change their faces:’—they show themselves prepared to follow their ruler.

Wise men, occupying themselves with the determination of the seasons and questions of time, have in all ages based their judgments on the observation of the heavenly bodies. We find this insisted on in the first book of the Shfi, by the ancient Yao. But how this application of the Great Symbolism really flows from it, I must confess myself unable to discover. Once, however, when I was conversing about the Yi with a high Chinese dignitary, who was a well-read scholar also so far as his own literature was con cerned, he referred to this paragraph as proving that all our western science had been known to Fft-hsi and Confucius! _ What is said on the several lines is sufficiently illustrated in the notes on the Text.

L. The Great Symbolism here has come before us in the treatise on the Thwan. Of the application of that symbolism I can only say that, as has been seen in many other hexagrams, while good enough in itself, it is far-fetched, The same remark may be made on the explanation of the Text of the first line. I can myself do little more than guess at its meaning. The Khang-hs! editors observe that nothing is said about the case of the ‘concubine’ in the Text; but that it is covered by the ‘following the more noble,’ ‘so condensed and complete are the words of the sage!' The same editors find a pregnant sense in the conclusion of paragraph 2‘ There will be no fault in me to which my enemy can point, and his disposition to find fault will be diminished.’ ‘What was required of the caldron in the third line was that that line and line 5, instead of 6, should be correlates;' but there is little meaning in such a statement.

Nor does the application of it; but may it not be loo late to fear, and order anew one’s thoughts and actions when t ie retributions in providence are taking place?

According to the view of the Khang-hst editors, the application should be translated:—‘ The superior man, in accord ance with this, thinks anxiously how he shall not go beyond the duties of his position.’ It is difficult to decide between this shade of the meaning, and the more common one which I have followed. The toes play a great part in walking; but they are here kept at rest, and so do not lose the correct idea of K 5 ,n. There is no correlation between lines 2 and 3, and thence the sub ject of 3 will hold on its upward way without condescending to 2. Khl%-izt finds an unsatisfactory auspice in paragraph 4.

When, as a stranger, he treats those below him (as the line indicates), the right relation between him and them is lost. 4. ‘The stranger is in a resting-place:’—but he has not got his proper position. ‘ He has the means of livelihood, and the axe: — but his mind is not at ease. 5. ‘ In the end he will obtain praise and a (high) charge: ’—he has reached a high place. 6. ‘Considering that the stranger is here.at the very height (of distinction),’ with the spirit that possesses him, it is right he (should be emblemed by a bird) burning (its nest)._______ Line 3 has a correlate in 6, which is weak, and as it were out of the game.

Hence the symbolism; and through the blindness of its subject his hurt, which unfits him to be employed. :, The line undivided like 4 is 1; perhaps we might translate— ‘He meets with the subject of the parallel line.’ ^ . ■ No one but himself has any confidence in the subject of line 0.

Different attempts are made to bring the idea of si travelling stranger out of the trigrams Kiln and Li; but none of them is satisfactory. Let Khung Ying-ta's view serve as a specimen of them:—'Afire on a mountain lays hold of the grass, and runs with it over the whole space, not slopping anywhere long, and soon disappearingsuch is the emblem of the traveller.’ The application may be derived well enough from the attributes of the trigrams; but does not fit in with the lessons of the Thwan and Hsiang. The meanness of the subject of line i does not arise from the nature of his occupation; but from his mind and aim being emptied of all that is good and ennobling. Strong and trusty servants are the most important condition for the comfort and progress of the traveller; and therefore it alone is resumed and expanded. The subject of line 3 treats those below him with violence and arrogance, which of course alienates them from him. ‘He has not got into his proper position’ seems to say no more than that 4 is a strong line in an even place. It is difficult to say what ‘he has reached a high place’ means. The fifth line is not in this hexagram the ruler’s seat; but by his qualities and gifts the subject of it attracts the attention and regard of his friends and of his ruler. The spirit that possesses the subject of line 6 is one of haughty arrogance, with which the humility that ought to characterise him cannot co-exist, His careless self-sufficiency has shut his mind against all lessons of wisdom. hex. 5 p APPENDIX II. firmness of a brave soldier: ’—his mind would in that case be well governed. 2. ‘ The good fortune springing from what bor ders on confusion’ is due to the position (of the line) in the centre. 3. ‘The regret arising from the violent and repeated efforts to penetrate’ shows the exhaustion of the will. 4. ‘ He takes game in his hunting, enough for the threefold use of it: ’-he achieves merit. 5. ‘ The good fortune of (the subject of) the fifth line, undivided,’ is owing to its correct position and its being in the centre. 6. ‘ The representative of penetration is beneath a couch: ’—though occupying the topmost place, his powers are exhausted. 1 He has lost the axe with which he executed his decisions;’—though he try to be correct, theie will be evil. LVII. I have said on the Thwan that some commentators make the upper trigram symbolical of the ordinances of the ruler and the lower symbolical of the obedience of the people. E. g„ -YMng-pe says‘ Superiors, in harmony with the duty of inferiors, issue their commands; inferiors, in harmony with the wishes of their supe riors, follow them, Above and below there are that harmony and deference; and this is the significance of the redoubled Sun, When governmental commands and business are in accoi dance with w at is right, they agree with the tendencies of the minds of the people who follow them.’ Paragraph a seems to say that the sincerity of purpose indicated by the central position of the second line conducts its subject to the right course, despite the many considerations that might dis tract him. , ,, , a j ‘The will is exhausted’ in paragraph 3 intimates that the rep efforts ’ made by its subject have exhausted him. He can now on y regret his failures. THE APPENDIXES. HEX. 59 . APPENDIX II. 341 LVIII. (Two symbols representing) the waters of a marsh, one over the other, form Tui. The superior man, in accordance with this, (encourages) the conversation of friends and (the stimulus of) their (common) practice. 1. ‘The good fortune attached to the pleasure of (inward) harmony' arises from there being nothing in the conduct (of the subject of the line) to awaken doubt. 2. ‘The good fortune attached to the pleasure arising from (inward sincerity) ’ is due to the confi dence felt in the object (of the subject of the line). 3. ‘ The evil predicated of one’s bringing around himself whatever can give pleasure’ is shown by the inappropriateness of the place (of the line). 4. ‘ The joy in connexion with (the subject of) the fourth line, undivided,’ is due to the happiness (which he will produce). 5. ‘ He trusts in one who would injure him:’— his place is that which is correct and appropriate. 6. ‘ The topmost line, divided, shows the pleasure (of its subject) in leading and attracting others:’— his (virtue) is not yet brilliant. What is said in paragraph 6 proceeds on a different view of the Text from that which I have followed, LVIII. The application of the Great Symbolism here will recall to many readers the Hebrew maxims in Proverbs xxvii. 17,19. The sentiment of it, however, does not readily fit in to the teaching of the hexagram as set forth in the Text. There is nothing in the conduct of the subject of line x to awaken suspicion. He has as yet taken no action; but it was not neces sary to say anything like this about the subject of line 2, his central position being an assurance that he would never do anything of a doubtful character. LIX. (The trigram representing) water and that for wind moving above the water form Hwan.

There will be evil: ’—he loses the time (for action) to an extreme degree. 3. In ‘the lamentation for not observing the (proper) regulations,’ who should there be to blame ? 4. ‘The progress and success of the quiet and natural (attention) to all regulations ’ is due to the deference which accepts the ways of (the ruler) above. 5. ‘ The good fortune arising from the regulations enacted sweetly and acceptably ’ is due to (the line) amounts to this, that the ancient kings considered the services of religion, sincerely and earnestly attended to, as calculated to counter act the tendency to mutual alienation and selfishness in the minds of men, How they operated to have this beneficial effect we are not told. Nor is it easy to account for the extension of what is said in the Text about the establishment of the ancestral temple to the presentation also of offerings to God. Probably the writer had the same idea in his mjnd as in the Great Symbolism of hexagram 16, q. v. ‘The natural course’ pursued by the subject of line 1 is, pro bably, that required by the time.

Various explanations of the Great Symbolism have been attempted. E.g, Khl ng-jze says:-' The water which a lake or marsh will contain is limited to a certain quantity. If the water flowing in exceed that, it overflows. This gives us the idea of iTieh.' What is found on the application of it is to my mind equally unsatisfactory. The subject of line i knows when he might have free course and when he is obstructed, and acts accordingly. He is regulated by a consideration of the time. The subject of line 1 ought not to act, and he is still. The sub- ject of line a ought to act, and he also is si, 11 .

LXIII. Water and fire coming together as here, fire under the water, each element occupies its proper place, and their interaction will be beneficial. Such is the common explanation of the Great Symbolism; but the connexion between it and the application of it, which also is good in itself, is by no means clear. The notes on the different lines present nothing that has not been dealt with in the notes on the Text.

LXIV, In this last hexagram we have water below and fire above, so that the two cannot act on each other, and the Symbolism may represent the unregulated condition of general affairs, the different classes of society not harmonising nor acting together. The appli cation follows naturally. Kt Hsi and others suspect an error in the text of paragraph 1; yet a tolerable meaning comes from it as it stands, The Khang-hsl editors observe on paragraph z that an undivided line in the second place, and a divided line in the fifth place, are both incorrect, and yet it is often said of them that with firm cor rectness in their subjects there will be good fortune;—such is the virtue of the central position. This principle is at last clearly enun ciated in this paragraph. jOang-^ze says‘ The subject of line 4 has the ability which the time requires, and possesses also a firm solidity. He can carry out therefore his purpose. There will be good fortune, and all cause for repentance will disappear. The smiting of the demon region was the highest example of firm correctness.' Both the symbols in paragraph 6 indicate a want of caution, and an unwillingness, to submit one's impulses to the regulation of reason and prudence. CHAP. r. APPENDIX III. APPENDIX III. The Great Appendix. Section I. Chapter I. i. Heaven is lofty and honourable; earth is low. (Their symbols), AAien and Khwan, (with their respective meanings), were determined (in accordance with this). Things low and high appear displayed in a similar relation. The (upper and lower trigrams, and the relative position of individual lines, as) noble and mean, had their places assigned accordingly. Movement and rest are the regular qualities (of their respective subjects). Idence comes the definite distinction (of the several lines) as the strong and the weak. (Affairs) are arranged together according to their tendencies, and things are divided according to their classes. Hence were produced (the interpretations in the Yi, concerning) what is good [or lucky] and evil [or unlucky]. In the heavens there are the (different) figures there completed, and on the earth there are the (different) bodies there formed. (Corresponding to them) were the changes and transformations exhi bited (in the Yl). 2. After this fashion a strong and a weak line were manipulated together (till there were the eight trigrams), and those eight trigrams were added, each to itself and to all the others, (till the sixty-four hexagrams were formed). 3. We have the exciting forces of thunder and lightning; the fertilising influences of wind and rain ; and the revolutions of the sun and moon, which give rise to cold and warmth. 4. The attributes expressed by Kh'xtn constitute the male; those expressed by Khwan constitute the female. 5. Afiien (symbolises Heaven, which) directs the great beginnings of things; Khwan (symbolises Earth, which) gives to them their completion. 6. It is by the ease with which it proceeds that Khitti directs (as it does), and by its unhesitating response that Khwan exhibits such ability. 7. (He who attains to this) ease (of Heaven) will be easily understood, and (he who attains to this) freedom from laborious effort (of the Earth) will be easily followed. He who is easily understood will have adherents, and he who is easily followed will achieve success. He who has adherents can con tinue long, and he who achieves success can become great. To be able to continue long shows the virtue of the wise and able man; to be able to become great is the heritage he will acquire. 8. With the attainment of such ease and such freedom‘from laborious effort, the mastery is got of all principles under the sky. With the attainment of that mastery, (the sage) makes good his position in the middle (between heaven and earth). Chapter I is an attempt to show the correspondency between the phenomena of external nature ever changing, and the figures of the Yi King ever varying. The first four paragraphs, it is said, show, from the phenomena of production and transformation in external THE APPENDIXES. SFXT. I. CHAP. 2. APPENDIX HI, Chapter II. 9. The sages set forth the diagrams, inspected the emblems contained in them, and appended their explanations;—in this way the good fortune and bad (indicated by them) were made clear. 10. The strong and the weak (lines) displace each other, and produce the changes and transformations (in the figures). 11. Therefore the good fortune and evil (men tioned in the explanations) are the indications of the right and wrong (in men’s conduct of affairs), and the repentance and regret (similarly mentioned) are the indications of their sorrow and anxiety. nature, the principles on which the figures of the Y1 were made. The fifth and sixth paragraphs show, particularly, how the attri butes represented by the figures Z/nen and Khwiin are to be found in (the operations ofj heaven and earth. The last two para graphs show both those attributes embodied or realised in man. The realisation takes place, indeed, fully only in the sage or the ideal man, who thus becomes the pattern for all men. In paragraph 3 we have five of the six derivative tri- grams the six ‘ children,’ according to the nomenclature of the Wan arrangement. ‘Thunder' stands for Mn ( ~ — ), ‘light ning’ for It ( - \\ ‘wind’ for sun ( E E FEE ), ail d ‘rain’ for khan ‘The sun,’ however, is also an emblem of li, and ‘the moon’ one of kan generally said to represent ‘mountains,’ while tui (EE~E)> representing ‘collections of water,' has no place in the enumeration. Kt Hsi says that in paragraph 3 we have the natural changes seen in the phenomena of the sky, while in 4 we have such changes as find body and figure on the earth. Paragraphs 5 and 6 have both been misunderstood from neglect of the peculiar meaning of the character X’ih (), and from taking it in its common acceptation of ‘knowing.’ Both com mentaries and dictionaries point out that it is here used in the sense of 1 directing,' ‘ presiding over.’ In paragraph 7, however, it resumes its ordinary significancy. 12. The changes and transformations (of the lines) are the emblems of the advance and retrogression (of the vital force in nature). Thus what we call the strong and the weak (lines) become the emblems of day and night. The movements which take place in the six places (of the hexagram) show the course of the three extremes (i.e. of the three Powers in their perfect operation). 13. Therefore what the superior man rests in, in whatever position he is placed, is the order shown in the Yl; and the study which gives him the greatest pleasure is that of the explanations of the several lines. 14. Therefore the superior man, when living quietly, contemplates the emblems and studies the explanations of them; when initiating any move ment, he contemplates the changes (that are made in divining), and studies the prognostications from them. Thus ‘ is help extended to him from Heaven; there will be good fortune, and advantage in every movement.’ Chapter II, paragraphs 9-14, is divided into two parts. The »rmer contains paragraphs 9-12, and tells us how the sages, kmg ran and the duke of Bn, proceeded in making the Yi, so hat ie good fortune and bad of men’s courses should be indicated by in harmony with right and wrong, and the proas of tagraphs 13, 14 fam the second part, and speak of Ihe study of ie Yi by the superior man, desirous of doing what rs r,g . and icreasing his knowledge, and the advantages 1 ’ I can follow .0 some extent the first two statements 0 pam raph 12 so far as the ideas of the writer are concerned though ssertinfg any correspondence between the changes of the hues of heTS -d the operate of externa. tension of day and night, is merely an amusement he fan ,11 but fail, however, .0 grasp the idea in.he las. ® e—. h the rigram, the first line represents earth; the secon , , THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX HI. sect. r. Chapter III. 15. The Thwan speak of the em- blematic figures (of the complete diagrams). The Yao speak of the changes (taking place in the several lines). 16. The expressions about good fortune or bad are used with reference to (the figures and lines, as) being right or wrong (according to the conditions of time and place); those about repentance or regret refer to small faults (in the satisfying those con ditions) ; when it is said ‘ there will be no error,’ or ‘no blame,’ there is reference to (the subject) repairing an error by what is good. 17. Therefore the distinction of (the upper and lower trigrams and of the individual lines) as noble or mean is decided by the (relative) position (of the lines); the regulations of small and great are found in the diagrams, and the discriminations of good and bad fortune appear in the (subjoined) ex planations. 18. Anxiety against (having occasion for) re pentance or regret should be felt at the boundary line (between good and evil). The stirring up the thought of (securing that there shall be) no blame arises from (the feeling of) repentance. third, heaven; in the hexagram, the first and second lines are assigned to earth; the third and fourth, to man; and the fifth and sixth, to heaven. These are the three Powers, and each Power has 1 a Grand Extreme/ where its nature and operation are seen in their highest ideal. This is to some extent conceivable; but when I try to follow our author, and find an analogy between the course of these extremes and the movements in the places of the diagrams, I have no clue by which to trace my way. For the con cluding sentence of paragraph 14 see the duke of Mu on the last line of hexagram 14, CHAP. 4. 19. Thus of the diagrams some are small, and some are great; and of the explanations some are startling, and some are unexciting. Every one of those explanations has reference to the tendencies (indicated by the symbols). Chapter IV. 20. The Yl was made on a principle of accordance with heaven and earth, and shows us therefore, without rent or confusion, the course (of things) in heaven and earth. 21. (The sage), in accordance with (the Yi), looking up, contemplates the brilliant phenomena of the heavens, and, looking down, examines the defi nite arrangements of the earththus he knows the causes of darkness (or, what is obscure) and light (or, what is bright). He traces things to their be ginning, and follows them to their end; thus he knows what can be said about death and life. (He Chapter III, paragraphs 13-19, gives additional information about the constituent parts of the Yi, that is, the Text of the classic as we have it from king Wan and his son. The imperial editors say that it expands the meaning of the fourth paragraph, the third of chapter 2. It does do so, but this account hardly covers all its contents. ■ To understand the names ‘ small and great/ as used of the dia- grams in paragraphs i, and ij, it should be noted that hexagmms to which the divided or yin line gives their character are termed 'small,' and those where the un divided or y ang line roles are called‘great/ Xivt («,=), (12, z ) are instances of the former class; Fh (H rr; — ?.

There is a similarity between him and heaven and earth, and hence there is no contrariety in him to them. His knowledge embraces all things, and his course is (intended to be) helpful to all under the sky;—and hence he falls into no error. He acts according to the exigency of circumstances without being carried away by their current; he rejoices in Heaven and knows its ordinations;—and hence he has no anxieties. He rests in his own (present) position, and cherishes (the spirit of) generous benevolence;—and hence he can love (without reserve). 23. (Through the Y1), he comprehends as in a mould or enclosure the transformations of heaven and earth without any error; by an ever-varying adaptation he completes (the nature of) all things without exception; he penetrates to a knowledge of the course of day and night (and all other connected phenomena)it is thus that his operation is spirit like, unconditioned by place, while the changes which he produces are not restricted to any form. Chapter IY, paragraphs 20-23, > s intended still more to exalt the Yi, and seems to say that the sage by means of it can make an exhaus tive study of all principles and of human nature, till he attains to the knowledge of the ordinances of Heaven, Such is the account of the chapter given by Affi Hsf; but the second character in paragraph 21 must be understood in the signification which it has in ail the sixty-four sentences which explain the emblematic structure of the hexagrams, as-'in accordance with' and not ‘ by means of.' The CHAP. 5, Chapter V. 24. The successive movement of the inactive and active operations constitutes what is called the course (of things). imperial editors append to their statement of Jffi’s account, that it must be borne in mind that the sages had not to wait till the Yi was made to conduct their exhaustive study. They had done that before, and the Y{ may be considered as a talk on the results, drawn out in its own peculiar style. It holds the mirror up to nature; but its authors knew nature before they made it. In paragraph 21, ‘the brilliant phenomena of the heavens' are the various shining bodies of the sky, with their rising and setting; 1 the definite arrangements of the earth ’ are the different situations of its parts according to the points of the compass, and its surface as diversified by mountain and valley; and by the study of these the causes of day and night are known as being the expansion and contraction of the elementary ether. The same thing produces the facts of birth or life and death, Bing, which I have translated ‘essence,' denotes the more subtle and pure part of matter, and belongs to the grosser form of tlio elementary other; kin, or ‘spirit,’ is the breath, still material, lint purer than the png, and belongs to the finer, and more active form of the ether. Here khi is ‘ the breath of life,’ In the hwun or ‘soul (animus),’ the kli\\ predominates, and the png in the p h 0 or animal soul. At death the h w u n wanders away, ascending, and the pho descends and is changed into a ghostly shade. So did the ancient Chinese grope their way from material things to the concept and representation of what was immaterial. For my ‘characteristics of the anima and animus, 1 Dr, Med- hurst rendered ‘the circumstances and conditions of the Kwei Shiin s’ (Theology of the Chinese, pp. 10-12); but he observes that ‘ the Kwei Shins in the passage are evidently the expanding and contracting principles of human life.’ The kwei sh&ns are brought about by the dissolution of the human frame, and consist of the expanding and ascending shan, which rambles about in space, and of the contracted and shrivelled kwei, which reverts to earth and nonentity. It is difficult to express one’s self clearly on a subject treated so briefly and enigmatically in the text. We must understand that the subject of the predicates in this and the next two paragraphs is ‘ the sage,’ who has endeavoured to give a transcript of his views and doings in the Y i The character, THE APPENDIXES. 25. That which ensues as the result (of their movement) is goodness; that which shows it in its completeness is the natures (of men and things). 26. The benevolent see it and call it benevolence. The wise see it and call it wisdom. The common people, acting daily according to it, yet have no knowledge of it. Thus it is that the course (of things), as seen by the superior man, is seen by few. 27. It is manifested in the benevolence (of its operations), and (then again) it conceals and stores up its resources. It gives their stimulus to all things, without having the same anxieties that pos sess the sage. Complete is its abundant virtue and the greatness of its stores! 28. Its rich possessions is what is intended by ‘ the greatness of its stores; ’ the daily renovation which it produces is what is meant by 1 the abun dance of its virtue.’ 29. Production and reproduction is what is called (the process of) change 30. The formation of the semblances (shadowy forms of things) is what we attribute to Khxtw ; the giving to them their specific forms is what we attri bute to Khwan. 31. The exhaustive use of the numbers (that turn which I have translated by ‘ spirit-like ’ in paragraph 23, is different from Hi in paragraph 21. It is shan, a character of the phonetic class, while its primary material signification has not been satis factorily ascertained. ‘ The Chinese,' says P. Regis (vol. ii. p. 445), ‘use it in naming the soul, true angels, and the genii of idola ters; and the Christian Chinese use it when they speak of God, of the Holy Spirit, of angels, and of the soul of man. For what else could they do?’ chap. 5. APPENDIX HI. up in manipulating the stalks), and (thereby) knowing (the character of) coming events, is what we call prognosticating; the comprehension of the changes (indicated leads us to) what we call the business (to be done). 32. That which is unfathomable in (the move ment of) the inactive and active operations is (the presence of a) spiritual (power). Chapter V, paragraphs 24-32, still shows us the Yi fashioned so as to give a picture of the phenomena of the external universe; but the writer dwells more on the latter, and the different para graphs give an interesting view of his ideas on the subject. He supposes a constant change from rest to movement and from movement to rest, through which all things are formed, now still, now in motion, now expanding, now contracting. It is customary to speak of two forms of an original ether as the two elementary principles, but they are really one and the same ether, in a twofold condition, with a twofold action. By their successive movement the phenomena of existence are produced,—what I have called ‘ the course (of things) ’ in paragraph 24. It is attempted, however, by many native scholars and by some sinologists, to give to tao, the last character in that paragraph, the meaning of ‘ reason,' that which intelligently guides and directs the movements of the two elements. But this view is not in harmony with the scope of the chapter, nor can the characters be fairly construed so as to justify such an interpretation. The imperial editors say that the germ of the Mencian doctrine about the goodness of human nature is in paragraph 25 ; but it says more widely, that ‘ every creature is good, according to its ideal as from the plastic yin and yang. But few, the next para graph tells us, can understand the measure of this goodness. ‘The benevolent operations’ in the course of things in para graph %) are illustrated from the phenomena of growth and beauty in spring and summer; and the cessation of these in autumn and winter may be called ‘ a concealing and storing them up. Paragraph 29 seems to state the origin of the name Yi as applied to the book, the Yi King. In paragraph 30 the names Khk n and Khwan take the place of yin and yang, as used in paragraphs 24 and 32, In -Oien, 35 ^ THE APPENDIXES, SECT, I. Chapter VI. 33. Yes, wide is the Yi and great! If we speak of it in its farthest reaching, no limit can be set to it; if we speak of it with reference to what is near at hand, (its lessons are) still and correct; if we speak of it in connexion with all between heaven and earth, it embraces all. 34. There is Klnt n. In its (individual) stillness it is self-absorbed; when exerting its motive power it goes straight forward; and thus it is that its pro ductive action is on a grand scale. There is Khwan. In its (individual) stillness, it is self-collected and capacious; when exerting its motive power, it de- velopes its resources, and thus its productive action is on a wide scale. 35. In its breadth and greatness, (the Yi) corre- the symbol of heaven, every one of its three lines is undivided; it is the concentration of the yang faculty; so Klnvan, the symbol of the earth, is the concentration of the yin, The critics them selves call attention to the equivalence of the symbolic names here given to yin and yang. The connexion of the two is necessary to the production of any one substantial thing, The yang origin ates a shadowy outline which the yin fills up with a definite sub stance. So actually in nature Heaven (Khkn) and Earth (KhwHn) operate together in the production of all material things and beings. The ‘numbers,’ mentioned in paragraph 31, are not all or any numbers generally, but 7,8,9, 6, those assigned to the four ‘ em blematic figures, that grow out of the undivided and divided lines, and by means of which the hexagrams are made up in divination. The 1 future or coming events ’ which are prognosticated are not particular events, which the diviner has not already forecast, but the character of events or courses of actions already contemplated, as good or evil, lucky or unlucky, in their issue. The best commentary on paragraph 32 is supplied by paragraphs 8-ro of Appendix VI, The ‘Spirit’ is that of ‘God;’ and this settles the meaning of tao in paragraph 24, as being the course of nature, in which, according to the author, ‘ God worketh all in all.' CHAP. 7 . appendix hi. sponds to heaven and earth; in its ever-recurring changes, it corresponds to the four seasons; in its mention of the bright or active, and the dark or inactive operation, it corresponds to the sun and moon; and the excellence seen in the ease and ready response (of its various operations) corresponds to the perfect operations (presented to us in the pheno mena of nature). Chapter VII. 36. The Master said:—' Is not the Yi a perfect book?’ It was by the Yi that the sages exalted their virtue, and enlarged their sphere of occupation. Their wisdom was high, and their rules of conduct were solid. That loftiness was after the pattern of heaven; that solidity, after the. pattern of earth. Chapter VI, paragraphs 33-35, goes on further to celebrate the Yi as holding up the mirror to nature in all its operations and in its widest extent. The grandiloquent language, however, amounts only to this, that, when we have made ourselves acquainted with the phenomena of nature, we can, with a heated fancy, see some analogy to them in the changes of the diagrams and lines of the Yi book. Alien and Khwkn must be taken as the same names are understood in paragraph 30 above. ‘The Yi/ with which paragraph 33 begins, must be understood also at the commencement of paragraph 35. The character which I have translated by ‘ corresponds' throughout this last chapter, should not, it is observed, have stress laid upon it. IT Hsi says that it is simply equal to the ‘there is a similarity' of paragraph 23. ‘The bright or active element' and ‘the dark or inactive’ arc in the original, ‘ the yang and the yin.’ The correspondence predicted between them and the sun and moon, the brightness and warmth of the one, and the paleness and coldness of the other, shows us how those names arose, and that it is foreign to the original concept of them to call them ‘ the male and female principles: ’—with the last clause compare paragraphs 6-8. THE APPENDIXES. SECT. I, 37. Heaven and earth having their positions as assigned to them, the changes (of nature) take place between them. The nature (of man) having been completed, and being continually preserved, it is the gate of all good courses and righteousness, Chapter VIII. 38. The sage was able to survey all the complex phenomena under the sky. He then considered in his mind how they could be figured, and (by means of the diagrams) represented their material forms and their character. Hence these (diagrams) are denominated Semblances (or emblematic figures, the Hsiang). 39. A (later) sage was able to survey the motive influences working all under the sky. He contenv plated them in their common action and special nature, in order to bring out the standard and proper tendency of each. He then appended his Chapter VII, paragraphs 36,37, is understood to set forth how the sages embodied the teachings of the Yf in their character and conduct. But when it is said that Mt was by the Yt that they exalted their virtue and enlarged their sphere of occupation,’ the meaning can only be that what they did in these directions was in harmony with the principles which they endeavoured to set forth in the symbols of the Yf. ‘ Their rules of conduct were solid/ in paragraph 36, is, literally, ‘ their rules were low.’ To the height of heaven reached by the wisdom of the sages, the author opposes the low-lying earth, between which and their substantial practices and virtues he.dis covered some analog]'. It will be seen that the chapter commences with ‘The Master said.’ M Hsf observes that ‘as the Ten Appendixes were all made by the Master, these words are out of place, and that he conjectures that wherever they occur here and elsewhere, they were added after the sage's time,’ Their occurrence very seri ously affects the question of the authorship of the Appendixes, which I have discussed in the Introduction, pages 28-31. explanation (to each line of the diagrams), to deter mine the good or evil indicated by it. Hence those (lines with their explanations) are denominated Imi tations (the Y ho). 40. (The diagrams) speak of the most complex phenomena under the sky, and yet there is nothing in them that need awaken dislike; the explanations of the lines speak of the subtlest movements under the sky, and yet there is nothing in them to produce confusion. 41. (A learner) will consider what is said (under the diagrams), and then speak; he will deliberate on what is said (in the explanations of the lines), and then move. By such consideration and deliberations he will be able to make all the changes which he undertakes successful. 42. ‘Here hid, retired, cries out the crane; Her young’s responsive cry sounds there. Of spirits good I drain this cup; With thee a cup I’ll freely share.’ The Master said‘ The superior man occupies his apartment and sends forth his words. If they be good, they will be responded to at a distance of more than a thousand lihow much more will they be so in the nearer circle! He occupies his apart ment and sends forth his words. If they be evil, they will , awaken opposition at a distance of more than a thousand 11;—how much more will they do so in the nearer circle! Words issue from ones person, and proceed to affect the people. Actions proceed from what is near, and their effects are seen at a distance. Words and actions are the hinge and spring of the superior man. The movement of that THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX III. hinge and spring determines glory or disgrace. His words and actions move heaven and earth;—may he be careless in regard to them ? ’ 43. ' (The representative of) the union of men first cries out and weeps, and afterwards laughs.’ The Master said, on this;— ‘ The ways of good men (different seem). This in a public office toils; That in his home the time beguiles. One man his lips with silence seals; Another all his mind reveals. But when two men are one in heart, Not iron bolts keep them apart; The words they in their union use, Fragrance like orchid plants diffuse.’ 44. ‘The first line, undivided, shows its subject placing mats of the white grass beneath what he sets on the ground.’ The Master said' To place the things on the ground might be considered suf ficient; but when he places beneath them mats of the white grass, what occasion for blame can there be ? Such a course shows the height of care fulness. The white grass is a trivial thing, but through the use made of it, it may become impor tant. He who goes forward using such careful art will not fall into any error.’ 45. ‘ A superior man toiling laboriously and yet humble! He will bring things to an end, and with good fortune.’ The Master said on this:—‘He toils with success, but does not boast of it; he achieves merit, but takes no virtue to himself from it ; this is the height of generous goodness, and speaks of the. man who with (great) merit yet places CHAP. 8, himself below others. He wishes his virtue to be more and more complete, and in his intercourse with others to be more and more respectful;—he who is so humble, carrying his respectfulness to the utmost, will be able to preserve himself in his position.’ 46. ‘The dragon (is seen) beyond his proper haunts; there will be occasion for repentance.’ The Master said on this:—‘ He is noble, but is not in his correct place; he is on high, but there are no people to acknowledge him; there is a man of virtue and ability below, but he will not assist him. Hence whatever movement he may make will give occasion for repentance.’ 47. ‘ He does not quit the courtyard before his door—there will be no occasion for blame.’ The Master said on this‘ When disorder arises, it will be found that (ill-advised) speech was the stepping- stone to it. If a ruler do not keep secret (his deliberations with his minister), he will lose that minister. If a minister do not keep secret (his deliberations with his ruler), he will lose his life. If (important) matters in the germ be not kept secret, that will be injurious to their accomplish ment. Therefore the superior man is careful to maintain secrecy, and does not allow himself to speak.’ 48. The Master said:-’ The makers of the Y i may be said to have known (the philosophy of) robbery. The Yi says, “ He is a burden-bearer, and yet rides in a carriage, thereby exciting robbers to attack him.” Burden-bearing is the business of a small man. A carriage is the vehicle of a gentleman. When a small man rides in the vehicle of a gentle- THE APPENDIXES. SECT. I, man, robbers will think of taking it from him. (When one is) insolent to those above him, and oppressive to those below, robbers will wish to attack him. Careless laying up of things excites to robbery, (as a woman’s) adorning of herself excites to lust. What the Y1 says about the burden- bearer’s riding in a carriage, and exciting robbers to attack him, (shows how) robbery is called out.' Chapter VIII, paragraphs 38-48. In the first two paragraphs here we have an account of the formation of the diagra ms, and of the explanation of the whole hexagrams and of the individual lines. ‘The sage’ in paragraph 38 is intended presumably of Ffi-hst; but we cannot say, from it, whether the writer thought of him as having formed only the eight trigrams, or all the sixty-four hexagrams. In the diagrams, however, we have semblances, or representations, of the phenomena of nature, even the most com plex, and hard to be disentangled. Paragraph 39 goes on to speak of the explanation more expecially of the individual lines, by the duke of iffiu, as symbolical of good luck or evil, as they turned up in the processes of divination. Paragraph 40 declares the usableness (so to speak) of the dia grams and the explanations of them; and 41 shows us how a learner or consulter of the Y1 would actually proceed in using it. In paragraphs 42-48 we have the words of Confucius on seven lines in so many hexagrams, or rather his amplification of the words of the duke of Zau’s explanations of their symbolism. The lines are 2 of hexagram 61; 5 of 13; x of 28; 3 of 15; 6 of 1; 1 of 60; and 3 of 40. What Confucius says is not without in terest, but does not make the principles on which the Yi was made any clearer to us. It shows how his object was to turn the symbolism that he found to a moral or ethical account; and no doubt he could have varied the symbolism, if he had been inclined to do so. 1 have spoken in the preceding chapter of the difficulty which e phrase ‘The Master said’ presents to our accepting the Ap pendix as from the hand of Confucius himself. But his words in paragraph 43 are in rhyme. He did not speak so. If be rhymed his explanation of the symbolism of the line that is the ground work of that paragraph, why did he not rhyme his explanations of CHAP. 9 . APPENDIX III. Chapter IX. 49. To heaven belongs (the num ber) 1; to earth, 2; to heaven, 3; to earth, 4; to heaven, 5; to earth, 6 ; to heaven, 7; to earth, 8; to heaven, 9; to earth, 10. 50. The numbers belonging to heaven are five, and those belonging to earth are (also) five. The numbers of these two series correspond to each other (in their fixed positions), and each one has another that may be considered its mate. The heavenly numbers amount to 25, and the earthly to 30. The numbers of heaven and earth together amount to 55. It is by these that the changes and transformations are effected, and the spirit-like agencies kept in movement. 51. The numbers of the Great Expansion, (multi plied together), make 50, of which (only) 49 are used (in divination), (The stalks representing these) are divided into two heaps to represent the two (emblematic lines, or heaven and earth). One is then taken (from the heap on the right), and placed (between the little finger of the left hand and the next), that there may thus be symbolised the three (powers of heaven, earth, and man), (The heaps on both sides) are manipulated by fours to repre sent the four seasons; and then the remainders are returned, and placed (between) the two middle fingers of the left hand, to represent the intercalary month. In five years there are two intercalations, and there fore there are two operations; and afterwards the whole process is repeated. 52. The numbers (required) for K/ik n (or the the other lines ? To answer these questions categorically is beyond our power. The facts that suggest them increase the difficulty in ascribing this and the other additions to the Yi to the later sage. THE APPENDIXES. undivided line) amount to 216; those for Khwan (or the divided line), to 144. Together they are 360, corresponding to the days of the year. 53. The number produced by the lines in the two parts (of the Yl) amount to 11,520, correspond ing to the number of all things. 54. Therefore by means of the four operations is the Y! completed. It takes 18 changes to form a hexagram. 55. (The formation of) the eight trigrams consti tutes the small completion (of the Yl). 56. If we led on the diagrams and expanded them, if we prolonged each by the addition of the proper lines, then all events possible under the sky might have their representation. 57* (The diagrams) make manifest (by their ap pended explanations), the ways (of good and ill fortune), and show virtuous actions in their spiritual relations. In this way, by consulting them, we may receive an answer (to our doubts), and we may also by means of them assist the spiritual (power in its agency in nature and providence). 58. The Master said‘ He who knows the method of change and transformation may be said to know what is done by that spiritual (power).’ Chapter IX, paragraphs 49-58, is of a different character from any of the preceding, and treats, unsatisfactorily, of the use of numbers in connexion with the figure of the Yl and the practice of divination. In the 7 hang edition of the Yl, published in the seventh century, paragraph 49 is the first of the eleventh chapter according to the arrangement now followed, if/rang-jze restored it to its present place, which it occupied, as has been proved, during the Han CHAP. tO. APPENDIX III. Chapiter X. 59, In the Yl there are four things characteristic of the way of the sages. We should set the highest value on its explanations to guide dynasty, and to which it properly belongs. It and the next para graph should be taken together, and are distinct from what fol lows, though the Thang edition is further confused in placing 51 before 50, In 49 and 50 ‘heaven’ and ‘earth’ are used as we have seen jsT/nen and Khwan are in paragraphs 30 and 34, Odd num bers belong to the strong or undivided line, which is symbolical of the active operation in nature, and the even numbers to the weak or divided line, symbolical of its inaction. The phiaseology of the paragraphs, however, can only be understood by a reference to ‘ the river map,’ which has been given in the Introduction, pages 15,16. The map, as it appeared on the back of 1 the dragon-horse, con sisted of so many circles, and so many dark circular maikings, the former, it was assumed, being of the yang character, and the latter of the yin. Fh-hsl for the circle substituted the strong or undivided line (-■), and for the dark markings the weak or divided (— —). It will be seen that the yang symbols are the 1, 3, 5,) and 9 circles, and the yin are the 2, 4,6,8 and 10 cir cular markings, which is the pictorial delineation of paragiaph 49. The only thing to be said upon it is that the arrangement of the five circles and ten circular markings is peculiar and evidently devised ‘for a purpose.’ So far, however, as we know, no figure of the map was attempted till after the beginning of our twelfth The same figure is supposed to illustrate what ts said m para graph so: 'The numbers of the two series correspond to each other in their fixed positions.’ r and 2, and 3 an 4 certain y ro each other, and perhaps 5 and 6; hut 7 and 8, an 9 an not do so in the same way.

The last statement in the paragraph, however, derives no dta .ration, so far as I can see, from the figure. How can & nnm- hers effect the things that are predated of THE APPENDIXES, SECT, I, us in speaking; on its changes for (the initiation of) our movements; on its emblematic figures for (defi nite action as in) the construction of implements; jargon indeed about the formation of the five elements, but in order to make it appear not reasonable, but capable of being; related, writers call in ‘ the Lo writing' to the aid of ‘the Ho map; ’ and ‘ the five elements' is a division of the constituents of material things, which is foreign to the Yi. Paragraph 51 is intended to describe the process of divination in manipulating the stalks, but the description is confused by intro ducing into it the four seasons and the subject of intercalation, so as to be very difficult to understand. In the middle of the Ho map are the five circles symbolical of heaven and the ten dark terrestrial markings (live above and five below the others). These multiplied together give fifty, which form ‘ the great expansion. But 50 divining stalks or slips, when divided, give either two odd numbers or two even; and therefore one was put on one side. The remaining 49, however divided, were sure to give two parcels of stalks, one containing an even number of stalks, and the other an odd, and so might be said fan cifully to represent the undivided or strong, and the divided or weak line. It is needless to go minutely into the other steps of the process. Then comes in the counting the stalks by four, because there are four seasons in the year, and those that remain represent the intercalary days. But how could sucli a process be of any value to determine the days necessary to be intercalated in any particular year? The paragraph shows, however, that, when it was written, the rule was to intercalate two months in five years. But it does not say how many days would remain to be carried on to the sixth year after the second intercalation. Paragraph 52. The actual number of the undivided and divided lines in the hexagrams is the same, 192 of each, But the repre sentative number of an undivided line is 9, and of a divided line 6. Now 9x4 (the number of the emblematic figures) x 6 (the lines of each hexagram)=216; and 6x4x6=144. The sum of these products is 360, which was assumed, for the purpose of working the intercalation, as the standard length of the year. But this was derived from observation, and other considerations;—it did not come out of the Yi, Paragraphs 53-56. The number in 53 arises thus:—192 (the CHAP. 10. APPENDIX III. 369 and on its prognostications for our practice of divination. 60. Therefore, when a superior man is about to take action of a more private or of a public character, he asks (the Yi), making his inquiry in words. It receives his order, and the answer comes as the echo’s response. Be the subject remote or near, mysterious or deep, he forthwith knows of what kind will be the coming result. (If the Yi) were not the most exquisite thing under heaven, would it be concerned in such an operation as this ? 61. (The stalks) are manipulated by threes and fives to determine (one) change; they are laid on opposite sides, and placed one up, one down, to make sure of their numbers; and the (three necessary) number of each series of lines in the sixty-four hexagrams) x 36 (obtained as abovc)=fi9i2, and 192 x 24=4608, the sum of which = 11,520. This is said to be ‘the number of all things,’ the meaning of which I do not know. The ‘four operations’ are those described in paragraph 31. They were thrice repeated in divination to determine each new line, and of course it took eighteen of them to form a hexagram. The diagrams might be extended ad infinitum, both in the number of lines and of figures, by the natural process of their formation as shown in the Introduction, page 14, without the aid of the divining stalks; and no sufficient reason can be given why the makers of the figures stopped at sixty-four. It is difficult to believe the first statement in paragraph 5? and to understand the second. What is it ‘to Shan or spiritualise virtuous actions?’ The concluding statement approximates to impiety. We may grant what is affirmed in paragraph 58, but does the Yi really give us any knowledge of the processes of change and transformation in nature? What wiser are we after all the affirmations about numbers? ‘Change'schangings, understood activelythe work of Heaven; ‘transformations =■evolution.—the finish given by earth to the changing caused by Heaven. 37 ° THE APPENDIXES. changes are gone through with in this way, till they form the figures pertaining to heaven or to earth. Their numbers are exactly determined, and the emblems of (all things) under the sky are fixed. (If the Yi) were not the thing most capable of change of all things under heaven, how could it effect such a result as this ? 62. In (all these operations forming) the Yi, there is no thought and no action. It is still and without movement; but, when acted on, it penetrates forth with to all phenomena and events under the sky. If it were not the most spirit-like thing under the sky, how could it be found doing this ? 63. The (operations forming the) Yi are the method by which the sages searched out exhaus tively what was deep, and investigated the minutest springs (of things). 64. ‘Those operations searched out what was deep: ’—therefore they could penetrate to the views of all under the sky. ‘ They made apparent the minutest springs of (things): ’—therefore they could bring to a completion all undertakings under the sky. ‘ Their action was spirit-like: —therefore they could make speed without hurry, and reached their destination without travelling. 65. This is the import of what the Master said, that ( In the Yi there are four things indicating the way of the sages.’ Chapter X, paragraphs 59-65, enlarges on the service rendered to men by the Yi, owing to the way in which it was made by the sages to express their views and carry into effect their wishes. Paragraph 59 mentions the four things in which its usefulness appears. ‘The emblematic figures’ are the four hsiang, which are produced by the manipulation of the undivided and divided chap. ir. appendix III, Chapter XI. 66. The Master said:—‘What is it that the Y i does ? The Y i opens up (the knowledge of the issues of) things, accomplishes the undertak ings (of men), and embraces under it (the way of) all things under the sky. This and nothing more is what the Y i does. Thereby the sages, through (divination by) it, would give their proper course to the aims of all under the sky, would give stability to their undertakings, and determine their doubts.’ 67. Therefore the virtue of the stalks is versatile lines, and whose representative numbers are 9,8,7,6. ‘Divination' appears in the paragraph as pu-shih, which means ‘ divination by the tortoise-shell and by the stalks.’ But the tortoise-shell had nothing to do with the use of the Yi. Before the composition of these Appendixes the two terms must have been combined to express the practice of divination, without reference to its mode. Paragraph 60 speaks of the explanations and prognostications of the YI The 1 exquisiteness ’ ascribed to it would be due to the sages who had devised it, and appended their explanations to it; but the whole thing has no existence save in cloud-land. Paragraph 61 speaks of the operations with the stalks till the various changes in the results issued in the determination of the emblematic figures, and then in the fixing of the individual lines and entire hexagrams. Even Zu Hsi admits that the references to the different processes are now hardly intelligible. Paragraph 62. ITow could the writer speak of the Yi without thought or action as being most * spirit-like ? ’ If it did what he asserts, those who contrived it might be so described ? They would have been beings whose operation was indeed like that of spirits, inscrutable, ‘unfathomable’ (paragraph 32), even like that of the Spirit of God (VI, id). . , Paragraphs 63 and 64 ought not to be taken as saying that the sages did the' things described for themselves by the Yi. They knew them of themselves, and made the YI that others might come by it to do the same. So the writer imagined, No words could indicate more clearly than those of paragraph 65 that the para graphs between it and 59 did not come from Confucius, but from the compiler of the Great Appendix, whoever he was. m THE APPENDIXES. and spirit-like; that of the diagrams is exact and wise; and the meaning given by the six lines is changeful to give (the proper information to men). The sages having, by their possession of these (three virtues), cleansed their minds, retired and laid them up in the secrecy (of their own conscious ness). But their sympathies were with the people in regard both to their good fortune and evil. By their spirit-like ability they knew (the character of) coming events, and their wisdom had stored up (all experiences of) the past. Who could be able to accomplish all this ? (Only our) ancient sages, quick in apprehension and clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing know ledge, and with a majesty, going spirit-like to its objectsit was only they who could do so. 68. Therefore (those sages), fully understanding the way of Heaven, and having clearly ascertained the experience of the people, instituted (the employ ment of) these spirit-like things, as a provision for the use of the people. The sages went about the employment of them (moreover) by purifying their hearts and with reverent caution, thereby giving (more) spirituality and intelligence to their virtue. 69. Thus, a door shut may be pronounced (analo gous to) Khwan (or the inactive condition), and the opening of the door (analogous to) Khltix (or the active condition). The opening succeeding the being shut may be pronounced (analogous to what we call) a change; and the passing from one of these states to the other may be called the constant course (of things). The (first) appearance of anything (as a bud) is CHAP. II. APPENDIX III. what we call a semblance; when it has received its complete form, we call it a definite thing. (The divining-plant having been produced, the sages) set it apart and laid down the method of its employment,—what we call the laws (of divination). The advantage arising from it in external and in ternal matters, so that the people all use it, stamps it with a character which we call spirit-like. 70. Therefore in (the system of) the Yi there is the Grand Terminus, which produced the two ele mentary Forms. Those two Forms produced the Four emblematic Symbols, which again produced the eight Trigrams. 71. The eight trigrams served to determine the good and evil (issues of events), and from this detei- mination was produced the (successful prosecution of the) great business (of life). 72. Therefore of all things that furnish models and visible figures there are none greater than heaven and earth; of things that change and ex tend an influence (on others) there are none greater than the four seasons; of things suspended (in the sky) with their figures displayed clear and bright, there are none greater than the sun and moon; of the honoured and exalted there are none greater than he who is the rich and noble (one);. in pre paring things for practical use, and inventing and making instruments for the benefit of all under the sky, there are none greater than the sages; to ex plore what is complex, search out what is hidden, to hook up what lies deep, and reach to what is dis tant, thereby determining (the issues) for good or ill of all events under the sky, and making all men under heaven full of strenuous endeavours, there THE APPENDIXES. are no (agencies) greater than those of the stalks and the tortoise-shell. 73. Therefore Heaven produced the spirit-like things, and the sages took advantage of them. (The operations of) heaven and earth are marked by (so many) changes and transformations; and the sages imitated them (by means of the Yl). Heaven hangs out its (brilliant) figures from which are seen good fortune and bad, and the sages made their emblema tic interpretations accordingly. The Ho gave forth the map, and the Lo the writing, of (both of) which the sages took advantage. 74. In the (scheme of the) Yt there are the four symbolic figures by which they inform men (in divin ing of the lines making up the diagrams); the expla nations appended to them convey the significance (of the diagrams and lines); and the determination (of the divination) as fortunate or the reverse, to settle the doubts (of men). Chapter XI, paragraphs 66-74, treats of divination, and the scheme of it supplied in the Yi. That scheme must be referred first to Heaven, which produced the spirit-like things,—the divining- plant and the tortoise; and next to the sages, who knew the mind of Heaven, and made the plant and shell subservient to the pur pose for which they were intended. Paragraph 66 answers the question of what the Yi does; and if theie were truth or reason in it, the book and its use would be most important. I have closed the quotation of “the Master's” words at the end of the paragraph; but really we do not know if they extend so far, or farther. _ P ara £ ra phs 67 and 68 glorify the sages and their work. The virtues of the divining-plant all belonged to them, and it was thus that they were able to organise the scheme of divination. The production of‘ the spirit-like things ’ is, in paragraph 73, ascribed to Heaven; the characters about them in these paragraphs mean no more than is expressed in the translation. CHAP. 12. APPENDIX TIL Chapter XII. 75. It is said in the Yi, ‘Help is given to him from Heaven. There will be good fortune; advantage in every respect.’ The Master Paragraph 69 shows how the antinomy of the yin and yang pervades all nature, and how the sages turned it, as existing pre eminently in the divining-plant, to account. Paragraph 70. Evidently the author had in view here the genesis of the diagrams of the Yi, the number of figures increasing in a geometrical progression with the ratio of 2, while the lines of the figures form an arithmetical progression with the common differ ence of I. This is quite plain after‘the two elementary forms (_and-) ’ have been made. They give birth to ‘ the four emblematic symbols/ each of two lines (:=:, =r=r, = =, known, in this order, as the Grand or old Yang, the young Yin, the young Yang, and the Grand or old Yin). By the addition to each of these symbols first of the yang line, and then of the yin, there arise the eight trigrams, each of three lines, and the process of formation might be continued indefinitely. But how was the first step taken in the formation of the two ele mentary lines ? Here, it is said, they were produced by the Thai A'i, or the Grand Terminus. This is represented in Ah Hsf s ‘Youth’s Introduction to the Study of the Yi, by a circle; but he tells us that that representation of it was first made by Aau-jze (a.p. 1017-1073, called also Jfiu Tun-!, M u Mftwhfl, and, most of all, M u Lien-Mi), and that his readers must be careful not to suppose that Ffl-hst had such a figure in his mind’s eye, I fail myself to understand how there can be generated from a circle the undivided and the broken line. Given those two lines, and the formation of the sixty-four hexagrams proceeds regularly according to the method above described. We must start from them, whether we can account or not rnr the rise of the idea of them in the mind of Ffi-hsi. ' Ai , Leaving the subject of the figure of the Thai Ki, the name gives us hardly any clue to its meaning. EX is used for the extreme term of anything, as the ridge-pole of a house, or the pinnacle 0 a pagoda. The comment on the first sentence in the paragraph by Wang Pi (a.d. 226-249) isExistence must begin m non existence, and therefore the Grand Terminus produced the two elementary Forms. Thai K\\ is the denomination of what has no denomination. As it cannot be named, the text takes the extreme THE APPENDIXES. said:—* Yii (jjjjf) is the symbol of assisting. He whom Heaven assists is observant (of what is right); he whom men assist is sincere. The individual here indicated treads the path of sincerity and desires to be observant (of what is right), and studies to exalt the worthy. Hence “Help is given to him from Heaven. There will be good fortune, advantage in every respect.”' 76. The Master saidThe written characters are point of anything that exists as an analogous term for the Th£i AT Expanding Wang’s comment, Killing Ying-td says:—‘Thdi K\\ means the original subtle matter, that formed the one chaotic mass before heaven and earth were divided; ’ and then he refers to certain passages in lio-jze’s Tao Teh King, and identifies the Thali K\\ with his T&o. This would seem to give to Thdi K\\ a material meaning. The later philosophers of the Sung school, however, insist on its being immaterial, now calling it If, the principle of order in nature, now tao, the defined course of things, now Tf, the Supreme Power or God, now shan, the spiritual working of God. According to A 7 ;ang-jze, all these names are to be referred to that of ‘Heaven,’ of which they express so many different concepts, Paragraph 71 speaks of divination in practice, and paragraph 72 celebrates the service done by that through the plant and shell, as equal to, and indeed the complement of, all the other services ren dered by heaven and earth, the seasons, the sun and moon, the sages, and the greatest potentates, Surely, it is all very extravagant, The last two paragraphs resume the theme of the making of the Yf by the sages, and their teaching the practice of divination. Of the Ho map and the Lo writing, I have spoken in the Introduction, pages 14-18. But if we accept the statement that the Lo writing had anything to do with the making of the Yf, we must except M-hsf from the sages to whom we are indebted for it. It was to the Great Y(i, more than a thousand years later than Fft-hsi, that the Lo disclosed its writing j and Yu is never said to have had anything to do with the Yf. Nor is either of these things mentioned in Section ii, paragraph n, where the work of Fd-hsf is described more in detail. chap. 12 . appendix III. not the full exponent of speech, and speech is not the full expression of ideas;—is it impossible then to discover the ideas of the sages ? The Mastei said 1 The sages made their emblematic symbols to set forth fully their ideas; appointed (all) the diagrams to show fully the truth and falsehood (of things); appended their explanations to give the full expression of their words; and changed (the various lines) and made general the method of doing so, to exhibit fully what was advantageous. They (thus) stimulated (the people) as by drums and dances, thereby completely developing the spirit-like (character of the Yi).’ 77. May we not say that Khltn. and Khwan [= the yang and yin, or the undivided and divided lines] are the secret and substance of the Yi? Kh ien and Khwan being established in their several places, the system of changes was thereby constituted. If Kh'itw and Khwan were taken away, there would be no means of seeing that system; and if that system were not seen, Kh\\t n and Khwan would almost cease to act. 78. Hence that which is antecedent to the ma 1 terial form exists, we say, as an ideal method, and that which is subsequent to the material form exists, we say, as a definite thing. Transformation and shaping is what we .call change; carrying this out and operating with it is what we call generalising the method; taking the result and setting it forth for all the people under heaven is, we say, (securing the success of) the business of life. 79. Hence, to speak of the emblematic figures.- (The sage) was able to survey all the complex phe- THE APPENDIXES. nomena under the sky. He then considered in his mind how they could be figured, and (by means of the diagrams) represented their material forms and their character, Hence those (diagrams) are denominated Semblances. A (later) sage was able to survey the motive influences working all under the sky. He contemplated them in their common action and special nature, in order to bring out the standard and proper tendency of each. He then appended his explanation (to each line), to determine the good or evil indicated by it. Hence those (lines with their explanations) are denominated Imitations (the Yio). 80. The most thorough mastery of all the com plex phenomena under the sky is obtained from the diagrams. The greatest stimulus to movement in adaptation to all affairs under the sky is obtained from the explanations. 81. The transformations and shaping that take place are obtained from the changes (of the lines); the carrying this out and operating with it is ob tained from the general method (that has been established). The seeing their spirit-like intima tions and understanding them depended on their being the proper men; and the completing (the study of) them by silent meditation, and securing the faith of others without the use of words, de pended on their virtuous conduct. , Cha P ter xn > paragraphs 75-81, endeavours to show how we have in the Yf a representation of the changing phenomena of nature, and such a representation as words or speech could not convey, ■ Paragraph 75 has a good meaning, taken by itself; but it has no apparent connexion with the rest of the chapter., ZiHsf thought Section II. Chapter I. 1. The eight trigrams having been completed in their proper order, there were in each the (three) emblematic lines, They were then it was misplaced in its present position, and should be at the end of chapter 8 . Compare paragraph 14, The first two statements of paragraph 76 are general, but made here specially to exalt the Yt, as teaching more clearly and fully than written characters could have done. The Khang-hsi editors decide that ' the emblematic figures’ here are the eight trigrams of I'tVhsf,-against the view of M Hat, which restricts them to signify the undivided and divided lines, The repetition of the words, ‘The Master said,’ is probably the error of an early transcriber. Paragraphs 77 and 78 refer to the phenomena of nature and the course of human affairs, as suggesting and controlling the forma tion of the system of the Yf. The formation of that becomes the subject in paragraph 79, A 7 /ien and Kliw&n are used, as we have already seen them more than once, for the active and inactive con ditions in nature, indicated by the divided and undivided lines. It is difficult to translate what is said in paragraph 78, about Tfio and K/ii;— what I have called,‘an ideal method’and 'a definite’ thing. P. Regis translates the text by—‘ Quod non est inter figurata aut corporea sed supereminet est rationale, est ratio, T&o; quod (est) inter figurata subjacetque certac ligurae est sensibile, est instru- mentum,' But tao cannot here signify ratio or reason; for do and kh\\ arc names for the same thing under different conditions; first as a possibility, and next as an actuality. Such is the natural interpretation of the text, and so all ,the great scholars of the Sung dynasty construed it, as may be seen in the * Collected Comments of the imperial edition. So far they were correct, however many of them might stumble and fall in confounding this ( ideal method with God, What follows in the paragraph has no connexion with these two statements, P. Regis, who divides bis translation into two paragraphs, sa yg : — 1 Satis patet ulramque textus hujus partem non cohaerere. THE APPENDIXES, multiplied by a process of addition till the (six) component lines appeared. 2. The strong line and the weak push them selves each into the place of the other, and hence the changes (of the diagrams) take place. The appended explanations attach to every form of them its character (of good or ill), and hence the movements (suggested by divination) are deter mined accordingly. 3. Good fortune and ill, occasion for repentance or regret, all arise from these movements. 4. The strong and the weak (lines) have their fixed and proper places (in the diagrams); their changes, however varied, are according to the re quirements of the time (when they take place). 5. Good fortune and ill are continually prevailing each against the other by an exact rule. 6. By the same rule, heaven and earth, in their course, continually give forth (their lessons); the sun and moon continually emit their light; all the movements under the sky are constantly subject to this one and the same rule. Quod ergo Mas divisimus, id fecimus majoris perspicuitatis causa, non ratione ordinis qui certe nullus est, ut in re potius assuta quam connexa,’ .. . Paragraph 79 is a repetition of paragraphs 38,39, ( to introduce,’ says Zh Hst, ‘the two paragraphs’ that follow. ( The editors of the imperial edition find in 80, 81, an amplifica tion mainly of 76, showing how what is said there of the natural phenomena is exhibited in the Yi. The concluding sentence is a declaration (hardly necessary) about the sage makers, to the effect that they were as distinguished for virtuous conduct as for wisdom,—'the proper men’ to stand between Heaven and the mass of men as they did. chap. r. APPENDIX HI. 7. Kh ien, (the symbol of heaven, and) conveying the idea of strength, shows to men its easy (and natural) action. Kh wan, (the symbol of earth, and) conveying the idea of docility, shows to men its compendious (receptivity and operation). 8. The Yao (or lines) are imitative representa tions of this. The Hsiang, or emblematic figures, are pictorial representations of the same. 9. The movements of the lines and figures take place (at the hand of the operator), and are un seen; the good fortune or ill is seen openly and is beyond. The work to be done appears by the changes; the sympathies of the sages are seen in their explanations. 10. The great attribute of heaven and earth is the giving and maintaining life. What is most precious for the sage is to get the (highest) place— (in which he can be the human representative of heaven and earth). What will guard this position for him ? Men. How shall he collect a large population round him ? By the power of his wealth. The right administration of that wealth, correct instructions to the people, and prohibitions against wrong-doing;—these constitute his righteousness. Chapter I, paragraphs 1-10, is an amplification, according to KhungYing-ta and the editors of the imperial edition of the present dynasty, of the second chapter of Section i.. The lattei say that as all the chapters of Section i from the third onwards serve to elucidate chapter 2, so it is with this chapter and all that follow in this Section. The formation of the diagrams, and of their several lines, their indication of good fortune and bad, and the analogy between the processes of nature and the operations of divination, and other kindred subjects, are all touched on. ■ The order of the eight trigrams in paragraph 1, is Mien, tui, the appendixes. Chapter II. 11. Anciently, when Pao-hsi had come to the rule of all under heaven, looking up, he contemplated the brilliant forms exhibited in the sky, and looking down he surveyed the patterns shown on the earth. He contemplated the orna mental appearances of birds and beasts and the (different) suitabilities of the soil. Near at hand, in his own person, he found things for consideration, and the same at a distance, in things in general. On this he devised the eight trigrams, to show fully the It, Hn, sun, khan, kan, khwan. The three lines of each are emblematic—the first of heaven, the second of man, the third of earth. This is the most likely explanation of hsiang, ‘the em blems ' or ‘ similitudes' here. Why the maker—' sages ’—stopt at sixty-four figures, of six lines each, is a question that cannot he answered. Paragraph 2. Of course it was a great delusion to suppose that the changes of lines consequent on divination could be so con nected with the movements of life as to justify the characterising them as good or evil, or afford any guidance in the ordering of conduct. Paragraph 4, Who can tell ‘the requirements of the time’ amid the complexity of the phenomena of nature or the ever-varying events of human experience and history P The wiser men are,’ the more correct will be their judgments in such matters; but is there any reason for trusting to divination about them ? Paragraphs 5,6. It is difficult to say what is' the exact rule ’ intended here; unless it be that the factors in every movement shall act according to their proper nature. The Khang-hsi editors say‘ We see the good sometimes meeting with misfortune, and the bad with good fortune; but such is not the general rule.' ‘ The lessons that heaven and earth give forth’ are those concerning the method of their operation as stated in paragraph 7, and more fully w 6,7, 8 of Section i. What is said in paragraph xo is striking and important, and in aimony with the general strain of Confucian teaching;—as in the Great Learning, chapter 10, and many other places; but I fail to see its appropriateness in its present place in the Yi. ' CHAP. 2 , appendix hi. attributes of the spirit-like and intelligent (operations working- secretly), and to classify the qualities of the myriads of things. 12. He invented the making of nets of various kinds by knitting strings, both for hunting and fishing. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Li (the third trigram, and thirtieth, hexa gram). 13. On the death of Pao-hsi, there arose Shan- nang (in his place). He fashioned wood to form the share, and bent wood to make the plough- handle. The advantages of ploughing and weeding were then taught to all under heaven, The idea of this was taken, probably, from Yi (the forty- second hexagram), 14. He caused markets to be held at midday, thus bringing together all the people, and assem bling in one place all their wares. They made their exchanges and retired, every one having got what he wanted. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Shili Ho (the twenty-first hexagram). 15. After the death of Shan-nang, there arose Hwang Ti, Yao, and Shun. They carried through the (necessarily occurring) changes, so that the peo ple did (what was required of them) without being wearied; yea, they exerted such a spirit-like trans formation, that the people felt constrained to approve their (ordinances) as right. When a series of changes has run all its course, another change ensues. When it obtains free course, it will continue long. Hence it was that ‘these (sovereigns) were helped by Heaven; they had good fortune, and their every movement was advantageous.’ Hwang Ti, Yfto, and Shun (simply) wore their upper and THE APPENDIXES. lower garments (as patterns to the people), and good order was secured all under heaven. The idea of all this was taken, probably, from Kh\\t n and Khwan (the first and eighth trigrams, or the first and second hexagrams). 16. They hollowed out trees to form canoes; they cut others long and thin to make oars. Thus arose the benefit of canoes and oars for the help of those who had no means of intercourse with others. They could now reach the most distant parts, and all under heaven were benefited. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Hwin (the fifty-ninth hexagram). 17. They used oxen (in carts) and yoked horses ( to chariots), thus providing for the carriage of what was heavy, and for distant journeys,—thereby benefiting all under the sky. The idea of this was taken, probably, from S u i (the seventeenth hexagram). 1 3 . They made the (defence of the) double gates, and (the warning of) the clapper, as a preparation against the approach of marauding visitors. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Yii (the sixteenth hexagram). 19- They cut wood and fashioned it into pestles; they dug in the ground and formed mortars. Thus the myriads of the people received the benefit arising from the use of the pestle and mortar. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Hsiio ICwo (the sixty-second hexagram). 20. They bent wood by means of string so as to form bows, and sharpened wood so as to make arrows. This gave the benefit of bows and arrows, and served to produce everywhere a feeling of awe. CHAP. 2. APPENDIX III. ^5 The idea of this was taken, probably, from Khwei (the thirty-eighth hexagram). 21. In the highest antiquity they made their homes (in winter) in caves, and (in summer) dwelt in the open country. In subsequent ages, for these the sages substituted houses, with the ridge- beam above and the projecting roof below, as a provision against wind and rain. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Ta Zwang (the thirty- fourth hexagram). 22. When the ancients buried their dead, they covered the body thickly with pieces of wood, having laid it in the open country. They raised no mound over it, nor planted trees around; nor had they any fixed period for mourning. In subse quent ages the sages substituted for these practices the inner and outer coffins. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Ta Kwo (the twenty-eighth hexagram). 23. In the highest antiquity, government was carried on successfully by the use of knotted cords (to preserve the memory of things). In subse quent ages the sages substituted for these written characters and bonds. By means of these (the doings of) all the officers could be regulated, and (the affairs of) all the people accurately examined. The idea of this was taken, probably, from Kw&i (the forty-third hexagram). Chapter II, paragraphs 11-23, treats of the progress of civi lisation in China, and how the great men of antiquity who led the way in the various steps of that progress were guided by the Yt. Only five of these are mentionedthe first, Ffi-hsi, the beginning of whose reign, according to the least unlikely of the chronological accounts, must be placed in the 34th century b.c., while Shun's THE APPENDIXES. SECT. II, Chapter III. 24. Therefore what we call the Yi is (a collection of) emblematic lines. They are styled emblematic as being resemblances. reign ended in b.c. 2203. The time embraced in this chapter therefore is about twelve centuries and a half. But the writer gives his own opinion that the various discoveries and inventions mentioned were suggested to their authors by certain hexagrams of the Yt. The most commonly received view, however, is that Ffi-hsf had only the eight trigrams, and that the multipli cation of them to the 64 hexagrams was the work of king Wan, fully a thousand years later than Shun. This is the view of the editors of the imperial Yt. If it be contended that Fu-hst himself multiplied his trigrams, and gave their names to the resulting hexagrams, how could he have wrapped up in them the intimations of discoveries which were not made till many centuries after his death ? The statements in the chapter cannot be received as historical. It came from another hand, and not from Confucius himself. The writer or compiler gives the legends current about the various inventions of his time. The making of the trigrams is placed first of all to do honour to the Yi. The account of it is different from that given in paragraph 73 of the former Section, and we hear nothing of the Ho map or Lo writing. Paragraph 11. Pao-hsi here and in 13 is the same as Fft-hsi, As Pao is written here, there is no meaning in it; but another character Pbfto () is more common, and Phao-hsi would mean the inventor of the kitchen and cookery. This was the first step towards civilisation, and was appropriately followed by the hunting and fishing—both by means of nets—in paragraph 12. Paragraphs 13, r4 celebrate the work of Shan-nang, ‘the mar vellous or spirit-like husbandman.’ There was no metal about the primitive plough. The market for the exchange of commodities, without the use of coin, was an important advance. The invention of the robes, or of dress, mentioned in paragraph 15, would seem to show that previously men had been in a very rude state. The passage indicates, however, the courtesies and proprieties of social life, in which dress plays an important part, and which now began to be organised. The infant navigation in paragraph 16 was as little indebted to the use of metal, as the agriculture of 13. Paragraphs 17 and 18 show that in those primitive times there CHAP, 3. APPENDIX III. 25. What we call the Thwan (or king Wan’s explanations) are based on the significance (of each hexagram as a whole). 26. We call the lines (of the figures) Y&o from their being according to the movements taking place all under the sky. 27. In this way (we see) the rise of good fortune and evil, and the manifestation of repentance and regret. were already the practices of rapine and war. 1 The double gates ’ were those of the city wall, and of the enclosed suburb. The clapper may still be heard all over China. Bows and arrows, however, came rather later, as in 20. I suppose ‘the sages’ in paragraphs 21,22,23 refer generally to the great names mentioned in the previous chapters; nor can we define the distinction in the writer or compiler’s mind between 1 antiquity' and ‘ the highest antiquity,’ Compare what is said on the rise of the coffin in 22 with Mencius’ remarks on the same subject in Book III, ii, 5. 4. He would hardly have expressed himself as he did, if he had been familiar with this text. The invention of written characters is generally ascribed to Ffi-hsi. Paragraph 23 does not say so, but the inventor is said to have been a sage of a subsequent age to the time of ' high antiquity.’ That ‘ high antiquity ’ must stretch back very far. Chapter III, paragraphs 24-27, treats of the YI as made up of figurative diagrams, which again are composed of lines ever changing, in accordance with the phenomena of nature and human experience, while to the resulting figures their moral character and providential issues are appended by the sages. It may be regarded as an epitome of chapter 2 in Section i. Paragraph 24. It is observed by the editors of the imperial edition that a chapter should not begin with a ‘therefore;’ and they are inclined to agree with many critics who would enter this as the last paragraph of the preceding chapter. In that case it would be a summing-up of the concluding sentences of the different paragraphs, the truth and genuineness of which are deservedly suspected. The characters for ‘ therefore,’ however, are very loosely used in these Appendixes.—The lines, as they were intended by THE APPENDIXES. Chapter IV. 28. In the Yang trigrams (or those of the undivided line) there are more of the Yin lines, and in the Yin trigrams (or those of the divided line) there are more of the Yang lines. 29. What is the cause of this? It is because the Yang lines are odd (or made by one stroke), and the Yin lines are even (or made by two strokes). 30. What (method of) virtuous conduct is thus intimated? In the Yang trigrams we have one ruler, and two subjects—suggesting the way of the superior man. In the Yin trigrams we have two rulers, and one subject—suggesting the way of the small man. Fu-hsi, were emblematic; and they are still more so, as interpreted by the duke of Jfau. Meanings are drawn from the figures that resemble or illustrate principles in the subjects to which they are applied. Paragraph 25. The character rendered ‘the significance’ means materials, and is illustrated by reference to all the different materials out of which a house is composed. So there are half-a-dozen things about the diagrams, their lineal structure, emblematic in tention, their attributes, &c., out of which their interpretation is fashioned. Paragraph 26. E, g. an undivided line may appear in an odd place, which is right, or in an even place, which is wrong; and the case is the opposite with the divided lines. But what has this to do with the right or wrong of the events divined about? Chapter IV, paragraphs 28-30. Of the distinction of the trigrams into Yang and Yin. The trigrams that contain only one undivided line—Hn ( zzz khan ( gzjr: ), and kan (•—■ •—d—are called Yang. The undivided line is called ‘the lord’ in them. It is just the opposite with the Yin trigrams, in which there are two undivided lines, and one divided,—sun (==EE), If ( — — and tui r These together constitute the ‘ six children,’ or ‘ three CHAP. 5. APPENDIX III. Chapter V. 31. It is said in the Yl, ‘Full of auxious thoughts you go and come; (only) friends will follow you and think with you.’ The Master said: ‘In all (the processes taking place) under heaven, what is there of thinking ? what is there of anxious scheming ? They all come to the same (suc cessful) issue, though by different paths; there is one result, though there might be a hundred anxious schemes. What is there of thinking ? what is there of anxious scheming ? ’ 32. The sun goes and the moon comes; the moon goes and the sun comes;—the sun and moon thus take the place each of the other, and their shining is the result. The cold goes and the heat conies; the heat goes and the cold comesit is by this mutual succession of the cold and heat that the year is completed. That which goes becomes less and less, and that which comes waxes more and more;—it is by the influence on each other of this contraction and expansion that the advantages (of the different conditions) are produced. 33. When the looper coils itself up, it thereby straightens itself again; when worms and snakes sons ’ and ‘ three daughters ’ in the later arrangement of the tri- grams, ascribed to king Wan. Paragraph 29. Each part of the divided line counts as one; hence a yang trigram counts as 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 strokes, four of which are yin, while a yin trigrain counts as 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, only two of which are yang, But this is mere trifling. In explanation of paragraph 30 it is said that ‘ we have in the yang trigrams two (or more) subjects serving one ruler, and in the yin one subject serving two rulers, and two rulers striving together for the allegiance of one subject.’ This is ingenious, but fanciful; as indeed this distinction of the trigrams into a yang class and a y i n is a mere play of fancy. THE APPENDIXES. go into the state of hybernation, they thereby keep themselves alive. (So), when we minutely inves tigate the nature and reasons (of things), till we have entered into the inscrutable and spirit-like in them, we attain to the largest practical application of them; when that application becomes the quickest and readiest, and all personal restfulness is secured, our virtue is thereby exalted. 34. Going on beyond this, we reach a point which it is hardly possible to know. We have thoroughly comprehended the inscrutable and spirit-like, and know the processes of transformationthis is the fulness of virtue. 35. It is said in the Yi, * (The third line shows its subject) distressed before a rock, and trying to lay hold of thorns; entering into his palace and not seeing his wifethere will be evil.’ The Master said' If one be distressed by what need not distress him, his name is sure to be disgraced; if he lay hold on what he should not touch, his life is sure to be imperilled. In disgrace and danger, his death will (soon) come;—is it possible for him in such circum stances to see his wife ? ’ 36. It is said in the Yi, ‘ The duke with (his bow) shoots at the falcon on the top of the high wall; he hits it;—his every movement will be advantageous.’ The Master said;—‘ The falcon is a bird (of prey); the bow and arrow is a weapon (of war); the shooter is a man. The superior man keeps his weapon con cealed about his person, and waits for the proper time to move;—doing this, how should his move ment be other than successful ? There is nothing to fetter or embarrass his movement ;- and hence, when he comes forth, he succeeds in his object. chap. 5. appendix in. The language speaks of movement when the instru ment necessary to it is ready and perfect.’ 37. The Master said:- 1 The small man is not ashamed of what is not benevolent, nor does he fear to do what is not righteous. Without the prospect of gain he does not stimulate himself to what is good, nor does he correct himself without being moved. Self-correction, however, in what is small will make him careful in what would be of greater consequence;—and this is the happiness of the small man. It is said in the Yi, “His feet are in the stocks, and he is disabled in his toes:—there will be no (further) occasion for blame.” ’ 38. If acts of goodness be not accumulated, they are not sufficient to give its finish to ones name; if acts of evil be not accumulated, they are not sufficient to destroy one’s life. The small man thinks that small acts of goodness are of no benefit, and does not do them; and that small deeds of evil do no harm, and does not abstain from them. Hence his wickedness becomes great till it cannot be covered, and his guilt becomes great till it cannot be par doned. This is what the Yl says, ‘He wears the cangue and his ears are destroyedthere will be evil.’ 39. The Master said‘ He who keeps danger in mind is he who will rest safe in his seat; he who keeps ruin in mind is he who will preserve his interests secure; he who sets the danger of disorder before him is he who will maintain the state of order. There fore the superior man, when resting in safety, does not forget that danger may come; when in a state of security, he does not forget the possibility of ruin; and when all is in a state of order, he does not THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX III. forget that disorder may come. Thus his person is kept safe, and his states and all their clans can be preserved. This is according to what the Yl says, “ (Let him say), ‘ Shall I perish ? shall I perish ?’ (so shall this state be firm, as if) bound to a clump of bushy mulberry trees.” ’ • 40. The Master said:—Virtue small and office high; wisdom small and plans great; strength small and burden heavywhere such conditions exist, it is seldom that they do not end (in evil). As is said in the Yl, “The tripod’s feet are overthrown, and the ruler’s food is overturned. The body of him (who is thus indicated) is wet (with shame) :— there will be evil.” ’ 41. The Master saidDoes not he who knows the springs of things possess spirit-like wisdom? The superior man, in his intercourse with the high, uses no flattery, and, in his intercourse with the low, no coarse freedom:—does not this show that he knows the springs of things ? Those springs are the slight beginnings of movement, and the earliest indications of good fortune (or ill). The superior man sees them, and acts accordingly without waiting for (the delay of) a single day. As is said in the Yi, “He is firm as a rock, (and acts) without the delay of a single day. With firm goodness there will be good fortune.” Firm as a rock, how should he have to wait a single day to ensure his knowing (those springs and his course) ? The superior man knows the minute and the manifested; he knows what is weak, and what is strong:—he is a model to ten thousand.’ 42. The Master said‘ I may venture to say that the son of the Yen family had nearly attained (the I chap. 5. standard of perfection). If anything that he did was not good, he was sure to become conscious of that; and when he knew it, he did not do the thing again. As is said in the Yi, “(The first line shows its sub ject) returning from an error that has not led him far away. There is no occasion for repentance. There will be great good.’” 43. There is an intermingling of the genial in fluences of heaven and earth, and transformation in its various forms abundantly proceeds. There is an intercommunication of seed between male and female, and transformation in its living types pro ceeds. What is said in the Yi, ‘ Three individuals are walking together and one is made to disappear; there is (but) one man walking, and he gets his mate, tells us of the effort (in nature) at oneness (of operation). 44. The Master said:— c The superior man (in a high place) composes himself before he (tries to) move others; makes his mind restful and easy before he speaks; settles (the principles of) his intercourse with others before he seeks anything from them. The superior man cultivates these three things, and so is complete. If he try to move others while he is himself in unrest, the people will not (act) with him; if he speak while he is himself in a state of apprehension, the people will not respond to him; if without (certain principles of) intercommunica tion, he issue his requests, the people will not grant them. When there are none to accord with him, those who (work to) injure him will make their appearance. As is said in the Y 1 , “ (We see one) to whose advantage none will contribute, while some will seek to assail him. He observes no THE APPENDIXES. regular rule in the ordering of his heart :—there will be evil.’” Chapter V, paragraphs 31-44, gives the words of the duke of Aau on eleven different lines in the Text of the Yi, along with remarks of Confucius in farther illustration of them. But they seem also to be intended to bring forth more fully the meaning of certain previous utterances about the structure and scope of the Yi. Paragraphs 31-34 start from the fourth line of the 31st hexa gram, which would seem merely to require a steady and unvarying purpose in any one, in order to the full development of his influ ence. The editors of the imperial edition, however, make the whole a sequel of paragraph 5. But granted that there is no ‘ anxious scheming ’ in the processes of the natural world or in the phenomena of insect life, there is really no analogy to their pro ceedings in the course of the man who makes himself master of ‘ the nature and reasons of things,’ as described in 33 and 34. Nor are ‘the nature and reasons of things’ to be found in the Yi, as the writer believed they were. Such as it is, it requires immense thought to understand it, and when we have laid hold of it, there is nothing substantial in our grasp. The ‘virtue' predicated of such attainment is not so much moral excellence, as apprehension and the power and ability to invent, and to affect others. Paragraph 35. See on the third line of Khwan, the 47th hexagram. If we were to translate the explanations of the line after Confucius, we should put the first two statements hypotheti cally ; but the four that compose it seem to run on in the same way. They are all, I apprehend, hypothetical. Paragraph 36. See on the last line of ATeh, the 40th hexa gram. Paragraph 37. See on the first line of Shih Ho, the 21st hexa gram. The ‘self-correction in what is small’ implies of course that the small man has been ‘ awed.’ What is said about him here is true; but we hardly expect it in this place. Paragraph 38 should probably begin, like those before and after it, with ‘ The Master said.' The characters quoted from the Yi are again from the text of Shih Ho, on the last line. Paragraph 39, See on the fifth line of Phi, the 12th hexagram. Paragraph 40 gives Confucius’ views on the fourth line of Ting, the 50th hexagram. In paragraph 41 we are conducted to the 16th hexagram,-—the chap. 6 . APPENDIX III. Chapter VI. 45. The Master said‘ (The tri- grams) A 7 rien and Khwan may be regarded as the gate of the Y1.’ KK\\t n represents what is of the yang nature (bright and active); Khwan what is of the yin nature (shaded and inactive). These two unite according to their qualities, and there comes the embodiment of the result by the strong and weak (lines). In this way we have the phenomena of heaven and earth visibly exhibited, and can com prehend the operation of the spiritual intelligence. 46. The appellations and names (of the diagrams and lines) are various, but do not go beyond (what is to be ascribed to the operation of these two con ditions). When we examine the nature and style second line of it. The being ‘firm as a rock’ is understood to symbolise the state of ‘rest,’ the quiet self-possession out of which successful movement and action is understood to spring. In paragraph 42, ‘the son of the Yen family’ is Yen Hui, the favourite disciple of Confucius. The passage quoted from the Yt is that on the first line of Fla, the 24th hexagram. To paragraph 43, as to paragraph 38 ,1 would prefix the cha racters for ‘ The Master said.’ ‘ Male and female' is to be taken generally, and not confined to the individuals of the human pair. One Chinese writer says that in the transformations ascribed to heaven and earth, birds, fishes, animals, and plants are included, but from the ‘ transformation in its living types' plants are excluded, because in their generation there is nothing analogous to the emis sion and reception of seed. Other Chinese writers, however, are well enough acquainted with the sexual system of plants. It would seem to me that Confucius, if the paragraph were really his, intended only plants or the vegetable world in his reference to the operation of heaven and earth, and had all living tribes in view in his mention of male and female. The passage of the Yi referred to is on the third line of Sun, the 41st hexagram. The application of it is far-fetched. Paragraph 44. See on the fifth line of Yi, the 42nd hexa gram. the appendixes. (of the appended explanations), they seem to express the ideas of a decaying age. 47. The Yi exhibits the past, and (teaches us to) discriminate (the issues of) the future; it makes manifest what is minute, and brings to light what is obscure. (Then king Wan) opened (its symbols), and distinguished things in accordance with its names, so that all his words were correct and his explana tions decisive;—(the book) was now complete. 48. The appellations and names (of the diagrams and lines) are but small matters, but the classes of things comprehended under them are large. Their scope reaches far, and the explanations attached to them are elegant. The words are indirect, but to the point; the matters seem plainly set forth, but there is a secret principle in them. Their object is, in cases that are doubtful, to help the people in their conduct, and to make plain the recompenses of good and evil. The principal object, it is said, of chapter VI, paragraphs 45-48, is to set forth the views of king Wan and his son in the explana tions which they appended to the diagrams and lines; and in doing this the writer begins in 45, with Ffi-hsfs starting, in the formation of his eight trigrams, from the devising of the whole and divided lines, to represent the two primitive forms in nature. The two ‘ pure trigrams formed of these lines, unmixed, give rise to all the others, or rather the lines of which they are formed do so; and are thus compared to a gate by which the various diagrams enter to complete the system that is intended to represent the changing phenomena of nature and experience, The next sentence in the above version of paragraph 45 appears in Canon McClatchie’s translation of the Yi, as follows:—‘jT/rien is the membrum viiile, and Khwan is the pudendum muliebre (the sakti of •AJien), It is hardly possible, on reading such a version, to sup- piess the exclamation proh pudor! Can a single passage be adduced in support of it from among all the Chinese critics in the CHAP. 7. APPENDIX HI. Chapter VII. 49, Was it not in the middle period of antiquity that the Y1 began to flourish ? Was not he who made it familiar with anxiety and cala mity ? 50. Thetefore (the 10th diagram), Li, shows us the foundation of virtue; (the 15th), Hsien, its handle, (the 24th), Ffi, its root; (the 32nd), Hang, its solidity; (the 41st), Sun, its cultivation; (the 42nd), Yi, its abundance; (the 47th), Khwan, its exeicise of discrimination; (the 48th), 3ing, its field; and (the 57th), Sun, its regulation. 51. In Li we have the perfection of harmony; in Hsien, we have the giving honour to others, line of centuiies? I believe not. The ideas which it expresses are gratuitously and wantonly thrust into this text of the Yi. ‘ Khk n* and ‘Khwan’ are not spoken of thus. If the latter half of the paragraph be unintelligible, this interpretation of the former would make the whole disgusting. In paragraph 46 the writer passes from the work of Ffi-hst to that of king Wan and his son, and the composition of the written Yi is referred to ‘ a decaying age,’—the age, namely, of the tyrant .Wau. I hen king Wan and the duke of M u, it is said, deploring the degeneracy of their times and the enormities of the government, indicated, by their treatment of the ancient symbols, their sense of right and wrong, and the methods by which the prevailing evils might be rectified. Paragraphs 47 and 48 follow and expand the meaning of 45. The editors of the imperial edition say that the former sentence of 47 is the sequel of 45, and the latter of 46, bringing us finally to the explanations and decisions of king Wan, as the most im portant portion of the Yi iffl Hsf, moreover, observes that throughout the chapter, as well as in the chapters that follow, there must be many characters wanting in the text, while there are many also that are doubtful. This is specially the case with 48. Where the order of the characters has been disarranged merely, correction is easy; but where characters are evidently missing, attempts to fill the lacunae are merely guess-work. THE APPENDIXES. and the distinction thence arising; in Fh we have what is small (at first), but there is in it a (nice) discrimination of (the qualities of) things; in Hang we have a mixed experience, but without any weari ness; in Sun we have difficulty in the beginning and ease in the end; in Yi we have abundance of growth without any contrivance; in Khwan we have the pressure of extreme difficulty, ending in a free course; in 3 ing we have abiding in one’s place and at the same time removal (to meet the move ment of others); and in Sun we have the weighing of things (and action accordingly), but secretly and unobserved. 52. (The use of) Li appears in the harmony of the conduct; of Hsien, in the regulation of cere monies ; of Ffit, in self-knowledge; of Hang, in uni formity of virtue; of Sun, in keeping what is harmful at a distance; of Y i, in the promotion of what is advantageous; of Khwan, in the diminution of re sentments; of Sing, in the discrimination of what is righteous; and of Sun, in the doing of what is appropriate to time and to circumstances. Chapter VII, paragraphs 49-52, is occupied with nine hexa grams, as specially indicating how the superior man, or the ruler, should deal with a time of trouble and solicitude, specially by the cultivation of his own virtue. Not, we are told, that the same thing might not be learned from other diagrams, but these nine specially occurred to the writer, or, as many think, to Confucius, Paragraph 49 is important as agreeing in its testimony with 46. The Yi was made in middle-antiquity; that is, in the end of the Shang dynasty, and the rise of the Z&u; and the maker or makers had personal and public reasons for anxiety about the signs of the times. Paragraph 50 shows the particular phase of virtue in each of the nine hexagrams that are mentioned; 51, the marvellous character- chap. 8. APPENDIX III. Chapter VIII. 53. The Yi is a book which should not be let slip from the mind. Its method (of teach ing) is marked by the frequent changing (of its lines). They change and move without staying (in one place), flowing about into any one of the six places of the hexagram. They ascend and descend, ever inconstant. The strong and the weak lines change places, so that an invariable and compendious rule cannot be derived from them;—it must vary as their changes indicate. 54. The goings forth and comings in (of the lines) are according to rule and measure. (People) learn from them in external and internal affairs to stand in awe. 55. (The book), moreover, makes plain the nature of anxieties and calamities, and the causes of them. Though (its students) have neither master nor guardian, it is as if their parents drew near to them, 56. Beginning with taking note of its explanations, we reason out the principles to which they point. We thus find out that it does supply a constant and standard rule. But if there be not the proper men (to carry this out), the course cannot be pursued without them. istics of each phase; and 52, its use. The ‘therefore' with which paragraph 50 commences shows the process of thought by which the writer passed from the anxiety that possessed the mind of the author of the Yi to the use to be derived, in such circumstances, from the study of Li and the other hexagrams. Chapter VIII, paragraphs 53-56, describes the method of study ing the Yi as consisting very much in watching the changes that take place in the lines, and reflecting on the appended explanations; while, after all, much must depend on there being ‘ the proper men, THE APPENDIXES. Chapter IX. 57. The Yi is a book in which the form (of each diagram) is determined by the lines from the first to the last, which must be carefully observed. The six lines are mixed together, accord ing to the time (when they enter the figure) and their substance (as whole and divided). 58. There is difficulty in knowing (the significance of) the first line, while to know that of the topmost line is easy;—they form the beginning and the end (of the diagram). The explanation of the first line tasks the calculating (of the makers), but in the end they had (but) to complete this. 59. As to the variously-disposed intermediate lines with their diverse formations, for determining their qualities, and discriminating the right and wrong in them, we should be unprovided but for the explanations of them. 60. Yea, moreover, if we wish to know what is likely to be preserved and what to perish, what will be lucky and what will be unlucky, this may easily be known (from the explanations of the different lines). But if the wise will look at the explanations of the entire diagrams, their thoughts will embrace more than half of this knowledge. 61. The second and fourth lines are of the same There seems to be a contradiction between the statements in paragraphs 53 and 56 about the book supplying, and not sup plying, a standard rule; but the meaning, probably, is that while it does not give a rule generally applicable, it gives rules for par ticular cases, Ki Hsi says he does not understand 54, and thinks some cha racters must have been lost. 1 The six places of the hexagram’ in 53 are, literally, ‘the six empties,' The places are so called, be cause it is only a temporary possession of them, which is held by the fugitive lines, whether whole or divided. CHAP. 9. APPENDIX III. quality (as being in even places), but their positions (with respect to the fifth line) are different, and their value is not the same; but the second is the object of much commendation, and the fourth the subject of many apprehensions,—from its nearness (to that line). But for a line in a place of weakness it is not good to be far (from the occupant of the place of strength), and what its subject should desire in such a case is (merely) to be without blame. The advantage (here) is in (the second line) being in the central place. 62. The third and fifth lines are of the same quality, (as being in odd places), but their positions are different; and the (occupant of) the third meets with many misfortunes, while the occupant of the fifth achieves much merit:—this arises from one being in the noble position and the other in the mean. Are they occupied by the symbol of weak ness ? There will be peril. By that of strength ? There will be victory. Chapter IX, paragraphs 56-62, speaks of the hexagrams as made up of the different lines, and various things to be attended to in those lines to determine their meaning. Paragraph 57. The time or order in which the lines enter de termines of course the place and number of each m the figure. Their ‘ substance’ is their form, as whole or divided, being yang 0t Paragraph 58 belongs to the first and sixth lines, We are hardly prepared for the statement that ‘the maker or makers had so much difficulty in determining the meaning of the first line, course when they had fixed that and completed the fi f re ’ e *' plaining all the lines, it was easy for the student to follow their 6X Paragraph 8 6^ seems to tay that the work of the duke of Bu on each line was but an indicating in detail of the processes of his father's mind in explaining the whole figure. THE APPENDIXES. Chapter X. 63. The Yi is a book of wide com prehension and great scope, embracing everything. There are in it the way of heaven, the way of man, and the way of earth. It then takes (the lines representing) those three Powers, and doubles them till they amount to six. What these six lines show is simply this,—the way of the three Powers. 64. This way is marked by changes and move ments, and hence we have the imitative lines. Those lines are of different grades (in the trigrams), and hence we designate them from their component elements. These are mixed together, and elegant forms arise, When such forms are not in their appro priate places, the ideas of good fortune and bad are thus produced. The last two paragraphs mention several points important to be attended to in studying, more especially, the duke of Zau on the several lines. Three different views of the concluding statement,— ‘ are they occupied.’ &c.are given in the imperial edition, ‘ It be longs,’ says Wft Zang, ‘ to the fifth line;’ 'to the third line,' says Hft Ping-wan (also of the Yuan dynasty); while Plan Hsing-kwo (of the Thang dynasty) held that it belonged to both. The Khang-hst editors say that' by discriminating and combining these views, we get to the meaning of the text,’ I am unable to do so. Chapter X, paragraphs 63, 64, speaks of the great comprehen siveness of the Yi, its figures and explanations being applicable to the three Powers—heaven, earth, and man, With paragraph 63. compare paragraph 4, Appendix VI. In the trigram the upper line represents heaven, the middle line man, and the lowest earth. This paragraph and that other are the nearest approach I know to an attempt to account for the doubling of the number of lines, and stopping with the hexagram; but the doing so was entirely arbitrary. Zft Hsi says:—‘ The upper two characters belong to heaven, the middle two to man, and the lower two to earth,’ No words could be more express; and yet Canon McClatchie says (p. 354):—'The two upper strokes represent Heaven, or Thai- yi, the husband; the two middle strokes, Earth, his wife; and the CHAP. IX. appendix III. Chapter XI. 65. Was it not in the last age of Yin, when the virtue of Kin had reached its highest point, and during the troubles between king Wan and (the tyrant) Kin, that the (study of the Yi) began to flourish ? On this account the explana tions (in the book) express (a feeling of) anxious apprehension, (and teach) how peril may be turned into security, and easy carelessness is sure to meet with overthrow. The method in which these things come about is very comprehensive, and must be acknowledged in every sphere of things. If at the beginning there be a cautious apprehension as to the end, there will probably be no error or cause for blame. This is what is called the way of the Yi. two lower strokes, Man, their son; all being animated by the same Divine Reason (tao) or Supreme God (Chih Shan),' This note shows how one error, or misunderstanding of the Chinese original, draws other errors with it, The character, tao in the paragraph has not at all the sense of reason, human or divine, but its primary and ordinary signification of the path or course. As Lft Bi (Han dynasty) says' In the way of heaven there are the changes of day and night, sun and moon; in that of earth, those of hardness and softness, dryness and moisture; in that of man, those of action and rest, of movement and stillness, of good fortune and bad, of good and evil,’ < The imitative lines ’ in the translation of 64, is simply ‘ the Yfi0 ’ in the Chinese text, which I have rendered according to the account of them in paragraph 8, et al. Their different grades are their position as high or low in the figures (paragraph 1, Section i), and their 'component elements,’ literally ‘their substance, or thing- nature,' is their structure as being yang or yin, according to the use of wuh in paragraphs 57, 59, et al. A yang line in an even place, or a yin line in an odd, is not in its appropriate place, and gives an indication of what is bad. Chapter XI, paragraph 65. P. Regis observes on this chapter < 1 do not hesitate to say that there is found nowhere in the whole 404 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. II. - 1 Chapter XII. 66.

(The hexagram) Khwan represents the most docile of all under the sky. A Through this quality its operations are always mani fested with the promptest decision, for it knows where there would be obstruction. 67. (The sages, who are thus represented, and who made the Y i,) were able to rejoice in heart (in the absolute truth of things), and were able (also) to weigh carefully all matters that could occasion anxiety; (thus) they fixed the good and bad fortune j (of all things) under the sky, and could accomplish the things requiring strenuous efforts. i 68, Therefore amid the changes and transforma tions (taking place in heaven and earth), and the words and deeds of men, events that are to be fortunate have their happy omens. (The sages) knew the definite principles underlying the prog nostications of the former class, and the future of Yi a passage which affords more light for the explanation of the book.' Paragraph 49 told us that 1 the study of the Yi flourished in the middle period of antiquity, and that the author of it was familiar with anxiety and troubles.’ That information becomes here more particular. The Yi, existing when this Appendix was written, was made in the closing period of the Yin dynasty, and the making of it was somehow connected with the attempts of the tyrant Afau against king Wan. We are not told expressly that the book was 4 written, in part at least, by king Wan; but the tradition to that effect derives a certain amount of support from what is said here. 4 The general object of the author is also stated clearly enough,— to inculcate a cautious and reverent administration of affairs, never forgetful of the uncertainties of life and fortune. CHAP. 12. APPENDIX III. 405 those of the latter, (now to be) ascertained by divination. 69. The places of heaven and earth (in the dia grams) having been determined, the sages were able (by means of the Yl) to carry out and complete their ability. (In this way even) the common people were able to share with them in (deciding about) the counsels of men and the counsels of spiritual beings. 70. The eight trigrams communicate their infor mation by their emblematic figures. The explana tions appended to the lines and the completed figures tell how the contemplation of them affected (the makers). The strong and the weak lines appear mixed in them, and (thus) the good and the evil (which they indicate) can be seen. 71. The changes and movements (which take place in the manipulation of the stalks and the formation of the diagrams) speak as from the stand point of what is advantageous. The (intimations of) good and evil vary according to the place and nature (of the lines), Thus they may indicate a mutual influence (in any two of them) of love or hatred, and good or evil is the result; or that mutual influence may be affected by the nearness of the lines to, or their distance from, each other, and then repentance or regret is the result; or the influence may be that of truth or of hypocrisy, and then the result is what is advantageous, or what is injurious. In all these relations of the (lines in the) Y1, if two are near and do not blend harmoniously, there may be (all these results),—evil, or what is injurious, or occasion for repentance and regret. 72. The language of him who is meditating a 40 6 THE APPENDIXES. SECT, II. revolt (from the right) betrays his inward shame; that of him whose inward heart doubts about it diverges to other topics. The words of a good man are few; those of a coarse man are many. The words of one who slanders what is good are un- Chapter XII, paragraphs 66-72, is generally divided into three sections;—the first, embracing 66-68, and treating of the sages, the makers of the Yi, as themselves independent of it, knowing all that it enables us to know, and able to accomplish all that it en ables us to accomplish; the second, embracing 69-71, and telling how the sages formed the Yi, and made all men, by means of it, partakers of their now unlimited knowledge and power; the third, comprised in paragraph 72, and saying, if it be genuine and in its proper place, that the ordinary speech of men is as mysterious and indicative of what is in them, as the explanations of the Yi are, when we consider who were its authors. ‘The sages,’ who are the subject of 65-68, are not mentioned in the text; but 67 makes it plain that the subject must be some per sonal being or beings. Neither jST/fcien nor Khwan can ‘ rejoice in heart, and weigh carefully matters occasioning anxiety.’ The com mentators generally interpolate ‘ the sages; ’ even Ying-ta of the Thang dynasty, who does not introduce the sages in his exposition, yet makes the subject to be ‘ the disposer and nourisher of all things.’ He gets to his view by an unnatural interpretation of two characters in 67, which are now thrown out of the text by all critics as not genuine. That ‘the sages ’ is really the subject in the mind of the writer appears from the express mention of them in 69, when also ‘heaven and earth’ take the place of JMien and Khwan. It is absurd, not to say blasphemous, to assume that the sages who made the Yi had the knowledge and ability here ascribed to them; but the theory of the Yi as containing a scheme for the discovery of the future necessitated the ascribing such attri butes to them. Compare with the whole Section, and especially with paragraph 68, what is said in ‘The Doctrine of the Mean,’ chapter 24. The first Section shows how the sages were themselves indepen dent of the Yi, and had no need of it; the second goes on to tell how they devised and constructed it, to make all men equal to themselves in a knowledge of phenomena and human events, and of their indications of, and issues in, the future.

Those points are:—their time, position, quality, mutual nearness, and responsive relation. It is by a consideration of the two latter points, moreover, that he must form his judgment on their appro priateness or inappropriateness in the three others.’ Paragraph 72 has really no connexion with the rest of the chapter. I have stated above how the critics attempt to make out such a connexion; but I agree myself with P. Regis, who appends to his version of the paragraph this note 1 Quae sententiae qui- dem sapiunt doctrinam Confucianam, at non ordinem, utpote cum praecedentibus minime cohaerentes, sed omnino ab iis abscissae avulsaeque.' appendix IV. APPENDIX IV. Supplementary to the TInvan and Yfio on the first and second Hexagrams, and showing how they may be interpreted of man’s nature and doings. Section I. Kmm. Chapter I. 1. What is called (under AVrien) ‘the great and originating ’ is (in man) the first and chief quality of goodness; what is called ‘ the penetrating’ is the assemblage of excellences; what is called ' the advantageous ’ is the harmony of all that is right; and what is called ‘ the correct and firm ’ is the faculty of action. 2, The superior man, embodying benevolence, is fit to preside over men; presenting the assemblage of excellences, he is fit to show in himself the union of all propriety; benefiting (all) creatures, he is fit to exhibit the harmony of all that is right; correct and firm, he is fit to manage (all) affairs. 3. The fact that the superior man practises these four virtues justifies the application to him of the words—' Kim n represents what is great and origin ating, penetrating, advantageous, correct and firm.’ The tide of this Appendix is in Chinese the Win Yen K 'wan, 1 1 he Record of Win Yen;’ and according to the analogy of the titles of the three Appendixes that follow, Win should per form the part of a verb and Yen that of a substantive. So the characters are usually taken, and to Win is given the meaning of ' Explaining (Shih)and to Yen that of'Words or Sentences,' meaning the Thwan of king Win, and the Yfio of the duke of Aau on the first two hexagrams. The document treats of these, CHAP. Chapter II. 4. What is the meaning of the words under the first line undivided, ‘ The dragon lies hid (in the deep)it is not the time for active doing ? ’ The Master said:—‘ There he is, with the powers of the dragon, and yet lying hid. The influence of the world would make no change in him; he would do nothing (merely) to secure his fame. He can live, withdrawn from the world, without regret; he can experience disapproval without trouble of mind. Rejoicing (in opportunity), he carries his principles and of no others. ‘ It shows the amount and depth of meaning in them,' says ATi Hsi, 'and the other hexagrams may be treated after the analogy supplied here.’ Confucius, it is said by others, died before he was able to carry out the plan which he had formed. But, as I have shown in the Introduction (pp. 28-30), it is more than doubtful whether we have in this Appendix anything at all directly from the sage. Chapter I, paragraphs 1-3, shows how the attributes of Kh ien, as explained by king W&n, are to be understood of the constituent principles of human nature. What is remarkable is, that we find paragraphs 1, 2, witli very little variation, in one of the narra tives of the Bo Iran, as having been spoken by a marchioness- dowager of LCl in ii.c. 564, several years before Confucius was born. One so familiar as M Hsi was with all the classical literature of his country could not be ignorant of this. His solution of the questions arising from it is, that anciently there was this explana tion of the characters of king WUn; that it was employed by Shu Xiang (of LA), and that Confucius also availed himself of it; while the chronicler used, as he does below, the phraseology of • The Master said,' to distinguish the real words of Confucius from such ancient sayings. But who was this chronicler? No one can tell. The legitimate conclusion from Xfi’s criticism is this, that so much of this Appendix as is preceded by ‘The Master said is from Confucius so much and no more. The ascription in paragraph 3 of ‘ the four virtues ’ to the supe rior or normal man, man in his best estate, and yet inferior to 1 1 e sagely man,' is Confucian, -after the style of the teaching of the Master in the Analects. 4io THE APPENDIXES. SECT. r. into action; sorrowing (for want of opportunity), he keeps with them in retirement. Yes, he is not to be torn from his root (in himself).’ This is ‘the dragon lying hid.' 5. What is the meaning of the words under the second line, ‘The dragon shows himself and is in the field;—it will be advantageous to see the great man ? ’ The Master said 1 There he is, with the dragon’s powers, and occupying exactly the central place. He is sincere (even) in his ordinary words, and earnest in his ordinary conduct. Guarding against depravity, he preserves his sincerity. His goodness is recognised in the world, but he does not boast of it. His virtue is extensively displayed, and transformation ensues. The language of the Yi, “ The dragon shows himself and is in the field;—it will be advantageous to see the great man,\" refers to a ruler’s virtue.’ 6. What is the meaning of the words under the third line, 1 The superior man is active and vigilant all the day, and in the evening (still) careful and apprehensive;—the position is dangerous, but there will be no mistake ?’ The Master saidThe supe rior man advances in virtue, and cultivates all the sphere of his duty. His leal-hearted ness and good faith are the way by which he advances in virtue. His attention to his words and establishing his sin cerity are the way by which he occupies in his sphere. He knows the utmost point to be reached, and reaches it, thus showing himself in accord with the first springs (of things); he knows the end to be rested in, and rests in it, thus preserving his righte ousness in accordance with that end. Therefore he occupies a high position without pride, and a low chap. 2. APPENDIX IV. 411 position without anxiety. Thus it is that, being active and vigilant, and careful (also) and apprehen sive as the time requires, though his position be perilous, he will make no mistake.’ 7. What is the meaning of the words under the fourth line, ‘He is as if he were leaping up, (but still) is in the deep;—there will be no mistake ? ’ The Master said:—‘He finds no permanent place either above or below, but he does not commit the error (of advancing). He may advance or recede;— there is no permanent place for him: but he does not leave his fellows. The superior man, advancing in virtue and cultivating the sphere of his duty, yet wishes (to advance only) at the (proper) time, and therefore there is no mistake.’ 8. What is the meaning of the words under the fifth line, 1 The dragon is on the wing in the sky;— it will be advantageous to see the great man ? ’ The Master said:—-‘Notes of the same key respond to one another; creatures of the same nature seek one another; water flows towards the place that is (low and) damp; fire rises up towards what is dry; clouds follow the dragon, and winds follow the tiger (so) the sage makes his appearance, and all men look to him. Things that draw their origin from heaven move towards what is above; things that draw their origin from the earth cleave to what is belowso does everything follow its kind.’ 9. What is the meaning of the words under the topmost line, ‘The dragon exceeds the proper limitsthere will be occasion for repentance ? ’ The Master said‘ The position is noble, but it is not that of office; (its occupant) dwells on high, but he has no people (to rule); and the men of talent THE APPENDIXES. and virtue in the positions below will give him no aid;—should he move in such a case, there will be occasion for repentance.’ In chapter II, paragraphs 4-9, Confucius is introduced, ex plaining, with considerable amplification, what is said by the duke of ITui under the several lines of the hexagram. 1 The dragon ’ becomes the symbol of 1 the superior man; ’ and of 1 the great man/ or the sage upon the throne. The language approaches at times to the magniloquence of Mencius, while in paragraph 8 the voice hardly seems to be that of the sage at all. With paragraph 5, compare chapters 8 and 14 of ‘the Doc trine of the Mean/ agreeing much in language anti sentiment with what we have here. The line, a strong or undivided line, and therefore yang, is said to be ‘exactly in the central place;' but the line is in the second, an even place, that proper to a yin line; and in other passages this might be explained in an unfavourable way, The Chinese character Eng has the meaning given to it, now of ‘exact/ and now of 'correct/ the latter being always favourably interpreted. Paragraph 8, The fifth is almost always the place of honour and authority in the hexagram, and therefore ‘ the great man ’ here con tinues to he the great man, ‘ the sage.' The argument is that as things of the same kind respond to and seek one another, so is it with the sage and ordinary man. They are of the same kind, though far apart; and when a sage appears, all other men look to him with admiration and hope. The continuity of the illustrations, however, is broken by the introduction of the dragon and clouds, and the tiger and wind. Are these of the same kind? An list says he does not think that the real dragon and real tiger are intended; but he does not tell us how he understood the terms. 3 ai A 7 /ing (early in the Ming dynasty) says:.‘ The dragon feels the influence of the clouds surcharged with rain, and rises from the deep, and when the tiger feels the approach of the cold winds he roars. Thus when the dragon rises, the clouds are sun; to collect; and when the tiger screams, the winds follow; ’ but all this does not help us to appreciate any better the words of the text. And the concluding illustration is nearly as foreign to our way of conceiving things. By 1 tilings that draw their origin from heaven ’ all animals •—moving creatures—are intended; and by those that draw their origin from the earth are intended all plants,—things that stand and CHAP. 3. appendix IV. 413.

Chapter IV, paragraphs 17-23, goes over the same ground for a third time, treating the various paragraphs chiefly from the stand point of time. Paragraph 17 tells us that time and circumstances are essential, as well as inward power, to successful development and demonstration. In paragraph 18, the words of the YAo about meeting with the great man are not quoted, but they prompted the latter half of it. Paragraph 19.

Chapter V, paragraphs 24-29. The author here, leaving the treatise on the symbolism of the Y£o, turns to that on the T hwan, or expositions of king Wan, and amplifies it, not quoting from it, however, so fully and exactly, as he has done in the previous chapters from the Yao. Paragraphs 24 and 25 are based on the statement of the signi ficance of the Thwan under .Oien, and not on the treatise on the symbolism. The originating power cannot be separated from that of penetration and development. The latter issues from theformer 41 6 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. I. Chapter VI. 30. In the superior man his conduct is (the fruit of) his perfected virtue, which might be seen therefore in his daily course; but the force of that phrase, ‘lying hid,’ requires him to keep re tired, and not yet show himself, nor proceed to the full development of his course. While this is the case, the superior man (knows that) it is not the time for active doing. 31. The superior man learns and accumulates the results of his learning; puts questions, and discrimi nates among those results; dwells magnanimously and unambitiously in what he has attained to; and carries it into practice with benevolence. What the Yi says, ‘The dragon appears in the fieldit will be advantageous to meet with the great man/ has reference to the virtuous qualities of a ruler (as thus described). 32. In the third line there is a twofold (symbol of) strength, but (the position) is not central. (Its as the summer follows on the spring, according to an illustration of M Hsf. ‘ The advantageousness ’ and ‘ firm correctness,’ he compares also to the autumn and winter, saying that the i^ien power in its essence, as it is in itself, is best described by these two latter characteristics, while the two former describe it in its opera tion. It is thus that he tries to give his readers an idea of what he understood by 'nature and feelings’ in 25. But this chapter treats of the KKm power in nature rather than in humanity. Confining our view to the power so operating, we cannot say that the descrip tion of it in 26 and 27 is magniloquent or hyperbolical. Paragraph 28 returns to the explanations of the lines of the hexagram by the duke of Jfau, which exhibit the power in different positions and relations, bringing out all its significance; and then 29 confines us to the fifth line, in which we have its ideal. The spheres of nature and of men seem to be in the view of the author, and therefore I introduce 'the great man/ as the subject, after the example of the best critics. Like the clouds and the rain to the thirsty earth, so is the rule of the sage to expectant humanity. chap. 6 . APPENDIX IV. 4*7 occupant) is not in heaven above, nor is he in the field beneath. Therefore there must be active vigi lance and cautious apprehension as the time requires; and though (the position be) perilous, there will be no mistake. 33. In the fourth line there is (the symbol of) strength, but (the position) is not central. (Its j occupant) is not in heaven above, nor is he in the field beneath, nor is he in the place of man inter mediate. Hence he is in perplexity; and being so, he has doubts about what should be his movements, and so will give no occasion for blame. 34. The great man is he who is in harmony, in . his attributes, with heaven and earth; in his bright ness, with the sun and moon; in his orderly pro- j cedure, with the four seasons; and in his relation to what is fortunate and what is calamitous, in har mony with the spirit-like operations (of Providence). He may precede Heaven, and Heaven will not act in opposition to him; he may follow Heaven, but will act (only) as Heaven at the time would do. If Heaven will not act in opposition to him, how much i less will men! how much less will the spirit-like operation (of Providence)! 35. The force of that phrase-'exceeding the proper limits’-indicates the knowing to advance but not to retire; to maintain but not to let perish; to get but not to lose. ) 36.

(What Is indicated by) Khwan is most gentle and weak, but, when put in motion, is object being to show how reasonable are the decisions and lessons of the duke of ifau. The subject of paragraph 30 has the virtue; but his position in the lowest place shows that his time is not yet come.' In paragraph 31 we have the superior man developing, by means of the processes described, into 1 the great man,’ with the attributes of a ruler, the appearance of whom is a blessing to men. The twofold symbol of strength in paragraph 32 is the yang or undivided line in the third place (odd) proper to it. There will be no mistake, because the subject of the line, in the exercise of his caution, will abstain from any forward movement. According to paragraph 63 of last Appendix, Section ii, both the third and fourth lines in the hexagram belong to man, and are intermediate between those of heaven and those of earth. Killing Ying-ti, to get over the difficulty in what is said on the fourth line, says that, as a matter of fact and locally, man is nearer earth than heaven, and is aptly represented therefore by the third line and not by the fourth ;~I prefer to point out the inconsistency, and leave it. The subject of this fourth line will move very cautiously, and so escape blame, The eulogium of‘the great man' in paragraph 34 cannot fail to recall to the classical scholar the thirty-first and other chapters of‘the Doctrine of the Mean,’ where the sage is described as ‘ The Equal of Heaven.’ In one sentence here he is spoken of as sometimes taking precedence of Heaven, which then does not act in opposi tion to him! I do not know of any statement about the sage, coming without doubt from Confucius, that is so extravagant as this, It is difficult—in fact impossible—to say from the Yi itself, what we are to understand by the kwei shan, which I have translated here by ‘ the spirit-like operations (of Providence).’ The compound denomination does not often occur in the book. In Appendix III, Section i, 21, kwei is the animaand shan the animus; and in paragraph 50,1 have translated the terms by ‘ the contracting and expanding operations.' In Appendix I, page 226 and page 259, the name is used as in the present text. That second instance and this CHAP.. hard and strong; it is most still, but is able to give every definite form. 2. ‘ By following, it obtains its (proper) lord,’ and pursues its regular (course). 3. It contains all things in itself, and its trans forming (power) is glorious. 4. Yes, what docility marks the way of Khwan! It receives the influences of heaven, and acts at the proper time. Chapter II. 5. The family that accumulates good ness is sure to have superabundant happiness, and the family that accumulates evil is sure to have superabundant misery. The murder of a ruler by paragraph were evidently constructed, the one on the model of the other. I think it likely that the breath or air, M, became the name with the earliest Chinese for their first concept of spirit; then the breath inspired or inhaled was called kwei, and became the name for the grosser part of the spirit, returning to the earth; and shan, the breath exhaled or expired, the name for the subtler and intellec tual spirit, ascending to a state of activity and enjoyment. The explanations of the terms in the R Ya and other dictionaries seem to justify this view. The combination kwei shan is sometimes best translated by ‘spiritual beings.’ The school of the Sung philosophy understand by it—the contracting and expanding of the primary matter, or that matter conceived of in two forms or with two opposite qualities. J/mng-jze says here that ‘Heaven and earth are another name for tao, and kwei shan another name fot “ the vestiges of making and transformation;’ and that the sage being in harmony with the tao or practical reason of the universe, how can men or the kwei sbiin be contrary to him? Whatever be thought of the Sung speculations and theories, I think that a trans lator ought to give an indication of the primary meaning of the name kwei shan. , Paragraphs 35 and 36 suggest the description of Confucius by Mencius, V, ii, 1, 5 , as the one among the sages who was most governed by the consideration of time, doing continually what the circumstances of the time required.

The causes of it have gradually accumulated,— through the absence of early discrimination.

The way of the earth is—‘ not to claim the merit of achievement/ but on behalf (of heaven) to bring things to their proper issue. 8. Through the changes and transformations pro duced by heaven and earth, plants and trees grow luxuriantly. If (the reciprocal influence of) heaven and earth were shut up and restrained, we should have (a state that might suggest to us) the case of men of virtue and ability lying in obscurity. The words of the Yl, ‘A sack tied up:—there will be CHAP. 2. appendix IV. no ground for blame or for praise/ are in reality a lesson of caution. 9. The superior man (emblemed here) by the ‘yellow’ and correct (colour), is possessed of com prehension and discrimination. He occupies the correct position (of supremacy), but (that emblem) is on (the lower part of) his person. His excellence is in the centre (of his being), but it diffuses a complacency over his four limbs, and is manifested in his (conduct of) affairs -.—this is the perfection of excellence. 10. (The subject of) the yin (or divided line) thinking himself equal to the (subject of the) yang, or undivided line, there is sure to be ‘ a contest.’ As if indignant at there being no acknowledgment of the (superiority of the subject of the) yang line, (the text) uses the term ‘ dragons.’ But still the (subject of neither line) can leave his class, and hence we have ‘ the blood ’ mentioned. The men tion of that as being (both) ‘azure and yellow’ indicates the mixture of heaven and earth. Hea ven’s (colour) is azure and earth’s is yellow. The hexagram Kh wan is dealt with in Section ii, and much more briefly than jOien in Section i. Much less distinct, more over, is the attempt in it to show how the attributes of the hexagram are to be understood of the principles of human nature. The most important portion of the Section, perhaps, is paragraph .<5, the first of chapter II, and I have spoken of it in the Introduction, pages 47 and 48. A P P E N D I X V. Treatise of Remarks on the Trigrams. Chapter I. i. Anciently, when the sages made the Yi, in order to give mysterious assistance to the spiritual Intelligences, they produced (the rules for the use of) the divining plant. 2. The number 3 was assigned to heaven, 2 to earth, and from these came the (other) numbers. 3. They contemplated the changes in the divided and undivided lines (by the process of manipulating the stalks), and formed the trigrams; from the movements that took place in the strong and weak lines, they produced (their teaching about) the sepa rate lines, There ensued a harmonious conformity to the course (of duty) and to virtue, with a dis crimination of what was right (in each particular case). They (thus) made an exhaustive discrimina tion of what was right, and effected the complete development of (every) nature, till they arrived (in the Yi) at what was appointed for it (by Heaven). Chapter I, paragraphs 1-3, treats of the rise of the scheme of the Yi from the wonderful qualities of the divining plant, the use of certain numbers, and the formation of the lineal figures. P. Regis translates paragraph x by—' The ancient (sagos), the most excellent men, were the authors of the Yt-king, in making which they were assisted by an intelligent spirit, who for their help produced the plant called Shih.’ But the text will not admit of this version, nor have I found the view given in it in any Chinese writer. It is difficult to make up one’s mind whether to translate—' the sage,' or * the sages.’ Khung Ying-ta contends that the writer had Ffi-hsi and him alone in his CHAP, 2. appendix v. Chapter II. 4. Anciently, when the sages made the YI, it was with the design that (its figures) should be in conformity with the principles underlying the natures (of men and things), and the ordinances (for them) appointed (by Heaven). With this view they exhibited (in them) the way of heaven, calling (the lines) yin and yang; thewayof earth, calling (them) the weak (or soft) and the strong (or hard); and the way of men, under the names of benevolence mind. To me it seems otherwise. Fu-hst, if we accept the testi mony of universal Chinese consent, made the eight trigrams; but he did not make the Yt, which, by the same consent, was the pro duction of king Wiin and his son. The text would seem to say that the sages ‘produced’ the plant, but this is so extravagant that the view indicated in my supplementary clause appears in all the best commentators. So understood, the YI maybe said to ‘give mysterious assistance to the spiritual Intelligences,’ or, if we take that name as singular (according to the analogy of chapter 6), to the Divine Being in affording a revelation of His will, as in paragraph 3, We may well say that it is a pity the revelation should be so enigmatical; but the author, it must be remembered, is writing from his own stand point. Wan and his son, as I have endeavoured to show in the Introduction, merely wished to convey, under the style and veil of divination, their moral and political lessons. On paragraph 2 it is said that heaven is round; and as the cir cumference of a circle is three times its diameter, hence 3 is the number of heaven. Again, earth is square, and as the circumference of a square is four times its length or breadth, or it consists of two pairs of equal sides, hence 2 is the number of earth. The concluding statement about ‘ the other numbers ’ is under stood of the manipulation of the divining stalks, as in Appendix III, i ( 51. That manipulation, thrice repeated, might leave three stalks each time, and 3 x 3=9; or 2, being in the same way in all-6; or twice 3 and once 2=8; or twice 2 and once 3=7. These are the numbers of the 4 binary symbols, employed in forming the new the old yang,=9; the young yin, =8; THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX Y. chap. 3. and righteousness. Each (trigram) embraced (those) three Powers; and, being repeated, its full form con sisted of six lines. A distinction was made of (the places assigned) to the yin and yang lines, which were variously occupied, now by the strong and now by the weak forms, and thus the figure (of each hexa gram) was completed. Chapter III. 5. (The symbols of) heaven and earth received their determinate positions; (those for) mountains and collections of water interchanged their influences; (those for) thunder and wind excited each other the more; and (those for) water and fire did each other no harm. (Then) among these eight symbols there was a mutual communication. 6. The numbering of the past is a natural pro cess ; the knowledge of the coming is anticipation. Therefore in the Yi we have (both) anticipation (and the natural process). Chapter II. The top line in each trigram thus belongs to the category of heaven; the bottom line to that of earth; and the middle line to that of man. The odd places should be occupied, ‘-correctly,’ by the undivided lines; and the even by the divided. The trigram being increased to the hexagram, lines 5 and 6 were assigned to heaven; 1 and 2 to earth; and 3 and 4 to man. 5 is the yang characteristic of heaven, and 6 the yin; so 1 and z in regard to earth; while 3 represents the benevolence of man, and 4 his righteousness., But all this is merely the play of fancy, and confuses the mind of the student. Chapter III, paragraphs 5 and 6, is understood, though not very clearly, by referring to the circular arrangement of the trigrams according to Ffi-hsi, as shown in Figure 2, of Plate III. Para graph 5 refers to the correlation of JSfAien and Khw&n, R&n and Tui, Kiri and Sun, Khan and Lf. Paragraph 6 is less easy oF apprehension. Starting in the same figure from Khltn and num bering on the left we come to ifan by a natural process. Then CHAP. 5, Chapter IV. 7. Thunder serves to put things in motion; wind to scatter (the genial seeds of) them; rain to moisten them ; the sun to warm them; (what is symbolised by) Kan, to arrest (and keep them in their places); (by) Tui, to give them joyful course; (by) Kh ien, to rule them; and by Khwan, to store them up. Chapter V. 8. God comes forth in Afan (to His producing work); He brings (His processes) into full and equal action in Sun; they are manifested to one another in Ll; the greatest service is done for Him in Khwan; He rejoices in Tui; He struggles in AfAien; He is comforted and enters into rest in Khan; and He completes (the work of the year) in Kan, 9. All things are made to issue forth in Afan, which is placed at the east, (The processes of pro duction) are brought into full and equal action in Sun, which is placed at the south-east. The being brought into full and equal action refers to the purity and equal arrangement of all things. Li gives the idea of brightness. All things are now made mani- we turn back, and numbering on the right, from Sun, we come by a backward process to Khwan. The same process is illustrated on a large scale by the circular arrangement of the 64 hexagrams in Plate I. But what the scope of the paragraph is I cannot tell, and am tempted to say of it, as P. Regis does, ‘ Haec observatio prorsus inanis est.’ In chapter IV we have the same circular arrangement of the trigrams, though they are named in a different order; the last first and the first last. The first four are mentioned by their elemental names; the last four by the names of their lineal figures, No special significance is attached to this. If it ever had any, it has been lost. THE APPENDIXES. chap. g. fest to one another. 11 is the trigram of the south. The sages turn their faces to the south when they give audience to all under the sky, administering government towards the region of brightness:—the idea in this procedure was taken from this. Kh wan denotes the earth, (and is placed at the south-west). All things receive from it their fullest nourishment, and hence it is said, 1 The greatest service is done for Him in Khwan.’ Tui corresponds (to the west) and to the autumn,—the season in which all things rejoice. Hence it is said, ‘He rejoices in Tui.’ He struggles in Kk\\t n, which is the trigram of the north-west. The idea is that there the inactive and active conditions beat against each other. Khan denotes water. It is the trigram of the exact north—the trigram of comfort and rest, what all things are tending to. Hence it is said, ‘ He is com forted and enters into rest in Khan. Kan is the trigram of the north-east. In it all things bring to a full end the issues of the past (year), and prepare the commencement of the next. Hence it is said, ‘ He completes (the work of the year) in Kan.’ Chapter V, paragraphs 8 and 9, sets forth the operations of nature in the various seasons, as being really the operations of God, who is named Ti, ‘the Lord and Ruler of Heaven,’ Those opera tions are represented in the progress by the seasons of the year, as denoted by the trigrams, according to the arrangement of them by king Wan, as shown also in Plate III, Figure 2. ! The greatest service.is done for Ti in Khwan;' Yang Wan-li (of our twelfth century, but earlier than KH Hst) says‘ Khwan is a minister or servant. Ti is his ruler. All that a ruler has .to do with his minister is to require his service.' 1 On the struggles in ZAien’ he says:— 'Kh ien is the trigram of the north-west, when the yin influence is growing strong and the yang diminishing.’ The ‘purity ’ predicated in paragraph 9 of things in Sun, was chap. 6. APPENDIX V. Chapter VI. 10. When we speak of Spirit we mean the subtle (presence and operation of God) with all things. For putting all things in motion there is nothing more vehement than thunder; for scattering them there is nothing more effective than wind; for drying them up there is nothing more parching than fire ; for giving them pleasure and satisfaction there is nothing more grateful than a lake or marsh; for moistening them there is nothing more enriching than water; for bringing them to an end and making them begin again there is nothing more fully adapted than Kan. Thus water and fire contribute together to the one object; thunder and wind do not act con trary. to each other; mountains and collections of water interchange their influences. It is in this way, that they are able to change and transform, and to give completion to all things. explained by M ng Khang-^ang (our second century) as equiva lent to ‘newness,’ referring to the brightness of all things in the light of spring and summer. On ‘ all things receive from the earth their fullest nourishment' the same Yang, quoted above, says:— ‘ The earth performs the part of a mother. All things are its children. What a mother has to do for her children is simply to nourish them.’ Chapter VI is the sequel of the preceding, There ought to have been some mention of Shan or ‘Spirit’ in chapter 5. It is the first character in this chapter, and the two characters that follow show that it is here resumed for the purpose of being explained. As it does not occur in chapter 5, we must suppose that the author of it here brings forward and explains the idea of it that was in his mind. Many of the commentators recognise this,—e.g. Liang Yin, as quoted in the Introduction, p, 33. Two other peculiarities in the style of the chapter are pointed out and explained (after a fashion) by 3hui JTing (earlier, probably, than the Sung dynasty)‘ The action of six of the trigrams is described, but no mention is made of K/iien or Khwan. But THE APPENDIXES. APPENDIX V. CHAP. 7. ] CHAP. 10. Chapter VII. 11. Kh ien is (the symbol of) strength; Khwan, of docility; /Can, of stimulus to movement; Sun, of penetration; Khan, of what is precipitous and perilous; Li, of what is bright and what is catching; Kan, of stoppage or arrest; and Tui, of pleasure and satisfaction. heaven and earth do nothing, and yet do everything; hence they are able to perfect the spirit-like subtilty of the action of thunder, wind, and the other things. (Moreover), we have the trigram Kan mentioned, the only one mentioned by its name, instead of our reading “ mountains.” The reason is, that the putting in motion, the scattering, the parching, and the moistening, are all the pal pable effects of thunder, wind, fire, and water. But what is ascribed to Kan, the ending and the recommencing all things, is not so evident of mountains. On this account the name of the trigram is given, while the things in nature represented by the trigrams are given in those other cases. The style suitable in each case is employed.’ Chapter VII mendons the attributes, called also the 'virtues,’ of the different trigrams. It is not easy to account for the qualities— 1 their nature and feelings '—ascribed to them. Khung Ying-ta saysJ/rien is represented by heaven, which revolves without ceasing, and so it is the symbol of strength; Khw&n by the earth, which receives docilely the. action of heaven, and so it is the symbol of docility; Jan by thunder, which excites and moves all things, and so it is the symbol of what produces movement; Sun by wind, which enters everywhere, and so it is the symbol of pene tration; Khan hy water, found in a place perilous and precipitous, and the name is explained accordingly; LI by fire, and fire is sure to lay hold of things, and so it is the symbol of being attached to; Kfin by a mountain, the mass of which is still and arrests progress, and so it is the symbol of stoppage or arrest; and Tui by a lake or marsh, which moistens all things, and so it is the symbol of satisfaction.’ The Khang-hsi editors consider this explanation of the qualities of the trigrams to be unsatisfactory, and certainly it has all the appearance of an ex post facto account. They prefer the views of the philosopher Shfio (of our eleventh century), which is based on the arrangement of the undivided and divided lines in the figures. This to me is more unsatisfactory than the other. The editors say, Chapter VIII. 12. /f/nen (suggests the idea of) a horse; Khwan, that of an ox; /Can, that of the dragon; Sun, that of a fowl; Khan, that of a pig; Li, that of a pheasant; Kan, that of a dog; and Tui, that of a sheep. Chapter IX. 13. Kh ien suggests the idea of the head; Khwan, that of the belly; /Can, that of the feet; Sun, that of the thighs; Khan, that of the ears; Li, that of the eyes; Kan, that of the hands; and Tui, that of the mouth. Chapter X. 14. /C/den is (the symbol of) heaven, and hence has the appellation of father. Khwan is (the symbol of) earth, and hence has the appella tion of mother, /fan shows a first application (of Khwan to Kh ien), resulting in getting (the first of) its male (or undivided lines), and hence is called ‘ the oldest son/ Sun shows a first application (of if//ien to Khwan), resulting in getting (the first of) its female (or divided lines), and hence is called ‘the oldest daughter.’ Khan shows a second application moreover, that Shao's account of the three yang trigrams, Jan, Khan, and Kan is correct, and that of the three yin, Sun, Li, and Tui incorrect; but this would be based on king Wan’s arrangement, which does not appear to have place here. Chapter VIII. In the Great Appendix, p. 383, it is said that Ffi-hsi, in making his trigrams, was guided by 'the consideration of things apart from his own person.’ Of such things we have a specimen here, The creatures are assigned, in their classes, to the different trigrams, symbolising the ideas in the last. chapter. We must not make any difference of sex in translating their names. Chapter IX. Ffi-hsi found also ‘ things near at hand, in his own person,’ while making the trigrams. We have here a specimen of such things. 430 THE APPENDIXES. CHAP. n.

KK\\t n suggests the idea of heaven; of a circle; of a ruler; of a father; of jade; of metal; of cold; of ice; of deep red; of a good horse; of an old horse; of a thin horse; of a pie bald horse; and of the fruit of trees. 16, Khwan suggests the idea of the earth; of a mother; of cloth; of a caldron; of parsimony; of a turning lathe ;■ of a young heifer; of a large wag gon ; of what is variegated; of a multitude; and of a handle and support. Among soils it denotes what is black. 17. Aan suggests the idea of thunder; of the dragon ; of (the union of) the azure and the yellow; of development; of a great highway ; of the eldest son; of decision and vehemence; of bright young bamboos; of sedges and rushes; among horses, of Chapter X has been discussed in the Introduction, pp. 49 and 50. Let it simply be added here, that the account which it does give of the formation of the six subsidiary trigrams is inconsistent with their gradual rise from the mutual imposition of the undivided and divided lines. chap. n. appendix V. 431 the good neigher; of one whose white hind-leg appears, of the praticer, and of one with a white star in his forehead. Among the productions of husbandry it suggests the idea of what returns to life from its disappearance (beneath the surface), of what in the end becomes the strongest, and of what is the most luxuriant. 18. Sun suggests the idea of wood ; of wind; of the oldest daughter; of a plumb-line; of a carpenter’s square; of being white; of being long; of being lofty; of advancing and receding; of want of deci sion; and of strong scents. It suggests in the human body, the idea of deficiency of hair; of a wide forehead; of a large development of the white of the eye. (Among tendencies), it suggests the close pursuit of gain, even to making three hundred per cent, in the market. In the end it may become the trigram of decision. 19. K han suggests the idea of water; of channels and ditches (for draining and irrigation); of being- hidden and lying concealed; of being now straight, and now crooked; of a bow, and of a wheel. As referred to man, it suggests the idea of an increase of anxiety; of distress of mind; of pain in the ears;—it is the trigram of the blood; it suggests the idea of what is red. As referred to horses, it sug gests the idea of the horse with an elegant spine; of one with a high spirit ; of one with a drooping head; of one with a thin hoof; and of one with a i; shambling step. As referred to carriages, it suggests t one that encounters many risks. It suggests what ' goes right through; the moon; a thief. Referred j to trees, it suggests that which is strong, and firm- hearted. THE APPENDIXES. CHAP. XI. 20. Li suggests the emblem of fire; of the sun; of lightning; of the second daughter; of buff-coat and helmet; of spear and sword. Referred to men, it suggests the large belly. It is the trigram of dry ness. 11 suggests the emblem of a turtle; of a crab; of a spiral univalve; of the mussel; and of the tor toise. Referred to trees, it suggests one which is hollow and rotten above. 21. Kan suggests the emblem of a mountain; of a by-path; of a small rock; of a gateway; of the fruits of trees and creeping plants; of a porter or a eunuch; of the (ring) finger; of the dog; of the rat; of birds with powerful bills; among trees, of those which are strong, with many joints. 22. Tui suggests the emblem of a low-lying col lection of water; of the youngest daughter; of a sorceress; of the mouth and tongue; of the decay and putting down (of things in harvest); of the removal (of fruits) hanging (from the stems or branches); among soils, of what is strong and salt; of a concubine; and of a sheep. Chapter XI may be made to comprehend all the paragraphs from the 15th to the end, and shows how universally the ideas underlying the Yi are diffused through the world of nature. The quality of the several trigrams will be found with more or less of truth, and with less or more of fancy, in the objects mentioned in connexion with them. More needs not to be said on the chapter than has been done in the Introduction, pp, 53 and 54. APPENDIX VI. The Orderly Sequence of the Hexagrams. Section I. 1-3. When there were heaven and earth, then afterwards all things were produced. What fills up (the space) between heaven and earth are (those) all things. Hence (Kkitn and Khwan) are fol lowed by Km \\ Km denotes filling up. 3-6. Km is descriptive of things on their first production. When so produced, they are sure to be in an undeveloped condition. Hence ATun is followed by Mang. Mang is descriptive of what is undeveloped,-—the young of creatures and things. These in that state require to be nourished. Hence Mang is followed by Hsu. Hsu is de scriptive of the way in which meat and drink (come to be supplied) z . Over meat and drink there are sure to be contentions 2 . Hence Hsu is followed by Sung. 6-8. Sung is sure to cause the rising up of the multitudes 3 ; and hence it is fallowed by Sze. Sze has the signification of multitudes 3 , and between multitudes there must be some bond of union. Hence it is followed by PI, which denotes being attached to. 8-11. (Multitudes in) union must be subjected to some restraint. Hence PI is followed by Hsiao [16] f f 434 the appendixes. sect. i. Kht. When things are subjected to restraint, there come to be rites of ceremony, and hence Hsiho Kkil is followed by Li 4 . The treading (on what is proper) leads to Thai, which issues in a state of freedom and repose, and hence Li is followed by Thai. 11-16. Thai denotes things having free course. They cannot have that for ever, and hence it is followed by Phi (denoting being shut up and re stricted). Things cannot for ever be shut up, and hence Phi is followed by Thung 3an. To him who cultivates union with men, things must come to belong, and hence Thung Ban is followed by Td Yd. Those who have what is great should not allow in themselves the feeling of being full, and hence Td Yu is followed by W/zien. When great possessions are associated with humility, there is sure to be pleasure and satisfaction; and hence AVzien is followed by Yti. 16-19. Where such complacency is awakened, (he who causes it.) is sure to have followers 5 . They who follow another are sure to have services (to perform), and hence Sui is followed by KCi 6 . Kti means (the performance of) services. He who per forms such services may afterwards become great, and hence Kft is followed by Lin. Lin means great 8 . 19-23. What is great draws forth contemplation, and hence Lin is followed by Kwan. He who attracts contemplation will then bring about the union of others with himself, and hence Kwan is followed by Shih Ho. Shih Ho means union. But things should not be united in a reckless or irregular way, and hence Shih Ho is followed by SECT. II. APPENDIX VI. 435 Pi. Pi denotes adorning. When ornamentation has been carried to the utmost, its progress comes to an end; and hence Pi is followed by Po. Po denotes decay and overthrow, 23-26. Things cannot be done away for ever. When decadence and overthrow have completed their work at one end, redintegration commences at the other; and hence Po is followed by Fu. When the return (thus indicated) has taken place, we have not any rash disorder, and Fu is followed by Wu Wang. Given the freedom from disorder and insin cerity (which this name denotes), there may be the accumulation (of virtue), and Wft Wang is followed byTaWM, 26-30. Such accumulation having taken place, there will follow the nourishment of it; and hence Ta KM is followed by L i denotes nourishing. Without nourishment there could be no movement, and hence ! is followed by Ta Kwo. Things can not for ever be in a state of extraordinary (progress) ; and hence Ti Kwo is followed by Kh&n. Khan denotes falling into peril. When one falls into peril, he is sure to attach himself to some person or thing; and hence Khan is followed by Li. Li denotes being attached, or adhering, to. 31,32. H eaven and earth existing, all (material) things then got their existence. All (material) things having existence, 'afterM^^ ^^ ^^& a l e anc ' female. From the exis^J^^^^d female there came afterwards husband ajK|j|jj|. From F f 2 43 ^ THE APPENDIXES. husband and wife there came father and son. From father and son there came ruler and minister. From ruler and minister there came high and low. When (the distinction of) high and low had existence, after wards came the arrangements of propriety and right eousness. The rule for the relation of husband and wife is that it should be long-enduring. Hence Hsien is followed by Hang. Hang denotes long en during 7 . 32-37. Things cannot lopg abide in the same place; and hence Hang is followed by Thun. Thun denotes withdrawing. Things cannot be for ever withdrawn; and hence Thun is succeeded by T 4 Zwang. Things cannot remain for ever (simply) in the state of vigour; and hence T£ Afwang is succeeded by din. 3 in denotes advancing. (But) advancing is sure to lead to being wounded; and hence 3 i n is succeeded by M i n g 1. 1 denotes being wounded. He who is wounded abroad will return to his home; and hence Ming 1 is followed by K\\t Zan. 37-40. When the right administration of the family is at an end, misunderstanding and division will ensue; and hence K\\i Zan is followed by Khwei. Khwei denotes misunderstanding and division; and such a state is sure to give rise to difficulties and complications. Khwei therefore is followed by Afien, Afien denotes difficulties; but things cannot remain for ever in such a state. ATi e n therefore is followed by ATieh, which denotes re laxation and ease, 40-44. In a state of relaxation and ease there are sure to be losses; and hence ATieh is followed APPENDIX VI. by Sun. But when Sun (or diminution) is going on without end, increase is sure to come. Sun therefore is followed by Yi. When increase goes on without end, there is sure to come a dispersing of it, and hence Yi is followed by Kwai, Kwai denotes dispersion. But dispersion must be succeeded by a meeting (again). Hence Kwai is followed by K&u, which denotes such meeting. 44-4S. When things meet together, a collection is then formed. Hence K&u is followed by 3hui, which name denotes being collected. When (good men) are collected and mount to the highest places, there results what we call an upward advance; and hence 3hui is followed by Shang. When such advance continues without stopping, there is sure to come distress; and hence Shang is followed by Khwan. When distress is felt in the height (that has been gained), there is sure to be a return to the ground beneath; and hence Khwan is followed by Bing- 48, 49. What happens under 3 ing requires to be changed, and hence it is followed by Ko (denoting change). 49-55. For changing the substance of things there is nothing equal to the caldron; and hence Ko is followed by Ting. For presiding over (that and all other) vessels, no one is equal to the eldest son, and hence Ting is followed by Afan. Afan conveys the idea of putting in motion. But things cannot be kept in motion for ever. The motion is stopped; and hence Afan is followed by Kan, which gives the idea of arresting or stopping. Things cannot be kept for ever in a state of repression, and hence Kin is followed by ATen, which gives the idea of 438 THE APPENDIXES. SECT. II. (gradually) advancing. With advance there must be a certain point that is arrived at, and hence Kit n is succeeded by Kwei Mei. When things thus find the proper point to which to come, they are sure to become great. Hence Kwei Mei is succeeded by Fang, which conveys the idea of being great. 55-57. He whose greatness reaches the utmost possibility, is sure to lose his dwelling; and hence Fang is succeeded by Lii (denoting travellers or strangers). We have in it the idea of strangers who have no place to receive them, and hence Lti is followed by Sftn, which gives the idea of (penetrating and) entering. 57-59. One enters (on the pursuit of his object), and afterwards has pleasure in it; hence Sftn is fol lowed by T u i. T u i denotes pleasure and satis faction. This pleasure and satisfaction (begins) afterwards to be dissipated, and hence Tui is fol lowed by Hwan, which denotes separation and division, 59-62. A state of division cannot continue for ever, and therefore Hwan is followed by 3 ieh (or the system of regulations) having been established, men believe in it, and hence it is fol lowed by Wung FA When men have the belief which Wung Fft implies, they are sure to carry it into practice; and hence it is succeeded by Hsido Kwo. 62-64. He that surpasses others is sure to remedy (evils that exist), and therefore Hsi&o Kwo is succeeded by Ki 31 . But the succession of events cannot come to an end, and therefore Ki 3! is SECT. II, APPENDIX VI. succeeded by Wei 31, with which (the hexagrams) come to a close. The few sentences on this Appendix in the Introduction, pp. 54, 55, are sufficient. It shows the importance of the meaning of the name in the attempt to explain the lineal figures, and prepares us to expect on each one a brief enigmatical essay, which, it has been seen, is the nature of the Text. But the writer, whoever he was, is by no means careful 'always to follow that Text in the significance of the characters, as will appear in the few instances to which attention is called in the following notices. The treatise is too slight to require, or to justify, an exhibition of all its inaccuracies. 1 But ATun does not denote filling up. It is the symbol of being in a state of distress and difficulty. The writer is thinking of the result of the interaction of heaven and earth as being to fill all between them with the various forms of living beings; and to represent that he gives the result of Afun, and not its meaning. He makes a blunder which might have been easily avoided, for he adds immediately that the character is descriptive of things on their first production. a It is difficult to follow the writer here. Hsti in the Text is the symbol of the idea of waiting. Does he mean that a provision of food and drink can only be made gradually? There is nothing in the character Hsti to awaken in the mind the idea of nourish ment. Then the genesis of contention which is given is strange. The. writer probably had in his mind the lines of the Shih, II, i, ode 5. 3 1 The loss of kindly feeling oft From slightest things shall grow. Where all the fare is dry and spare, Resentments fierce may glow.’ But what is allowable, good even, in poetry, is out of place in this treatise. s Contention on a great scale will put all the population of a state in excitement and motion, and military measures of repression will be necessary. But the idea of the multitudes in Sze would seem to be simply that of number, and not that of a numerous host. In a feudal kingdom, however, all the able-bodied people might be required to join the army. THE APPENDIXES. 4 Li, the name of the ioth hexagram, is the symbol for a shoe, and the act of treading or walking. It seems here to be derived from the homophonous 11 , the symbol of acts of ceremony. The identity of sound or name must be considered as accidental. A measured step would be one of the first ways in which the inward sense of propriety would manifest itself. 6 By the subject of Tfi Yfi and Z/rien we must understand the possessor of the kingdom,—the great man who in his greatness is yet distinguished by humility. He attracts followers. 11 For the true meaning of K \\1 and Lin, the names of hexa grams r8,19, see what is said in the notes on the Text of them. 1 The same reference should be made to the notes on the Text of LI si en and many of the other hexagrams that follow. APPENDIX VII. Treatise on the Hexagrams taken promiscuously, according to the opposition or diversity of their meaning. This last of the Appendixes is touched on very briefly in the concluding paragraph of the Introduction, p. 55. It is stated there to be in rhyme, and I have endeavoured to give a similar form to the following version of it. The rhymes and length of the lines in the original, however, are very irregular, and I found it impossible to reproduce that irregularity in English. i, 2.

    "normalized_summary": "Increase. Favor flows downward from those in power to those in need, and that shared abundance creates momentum. This is a moment to act boldly for the common good, not to hoard. Give sincerely, receive humbly, correct what’s wrong, and move fast on worthy action. Done properly, this attracts allies, trust, and mandate. Done selfishly, it isolates you and invites attack."

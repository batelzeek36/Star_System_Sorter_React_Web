    "legge_1899_public_domain": "In Phi there is the want of good understanding between the (different classes of) men, and its in dication is unfavourable to the firm and correct The symbolism of paragraph 1 is suggested by the three strong lines of AT/rien all together, and all possessed by the same instinct to advance. The movement of the first will be supported by that of the others, and be fortunate. The second line is strong, but in an even place. This is sup posed to temper the strength of its subject; which is expressed by the first of his characteristics. But the even place is the central; and it is responded to by a proper correlate in the fifth line above. Hence come all the symbolism of the paragraph and the auspice of good fortune implied in it. Beneath the symbolism in paragraph 3 there lies the persuasion of the constant change that is taking place in nature and in human affairs, As night succeeds to day, and winter to summer, so calamity may be expected to follow prosperity, and decay the flourishing of a state. The third is the last of the lines of JT/zien, by whose strength and activity the happy state of Thiti has been produced. Another aspect of things maybe looked for; but by firmness and correctness the good estate of the present may be long continued. According to the treatise on the Thwan, the subjects of the fourth and other upper lines are not ‘the small returning’ as opponents of the strong lines below, as is generally supposed; but as the correlates of those lines, of one heart and mind with them to maintain the state of Thai, and giving them, humbly but readily, all the help in their power. Tt-yf, the last sovereign but one of the Yin dynasty, reigned from b.c. 1191 to nfig; but what was the history of him and his sister here referred to we do not know. P. Regis assumes that he gave his sister in marriage to the lord of Aau, known in subse- THE Yt KING. course of the superior man. We see in it the great gone and the little come. 1. The first line, divided, suggests the idea of grass pulled up, and bringing with it other stalks with whose roots it is connected. With firm cor rectness (on the part of its subject), there will be good fortune and progress. 2. The second line, divided, shows its subject patient and obedient. To the small man (comport ing himself so) there will be good fortune. If the great man (comport himself) as the distress and ob struction require, he will have success. 3. The third line, divided, shows its subject ashamed of the purpose folded (in his breast). 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject acting in accordance with the ordination (of Heaven), and committing no error. His companions will come and share in his happiness. 5- In the fifth line, undivided, we see him who quent time as king Wan, and that she was the famous Thaf-sze ;— contrary to all the evidence I have been able to find on the subject. According to Khl ng-jze, Ti-yi was the first to enact a law that daughters of the royal house, in marrying princes of the states, should be in subjection to them, as if they were not superior to them m rank,. Here line 5, while occupying the place of dignity and authority m the hexagram, is yet a weak line in the place of a strong one; and its subject, accordingly, humbly condescends to his strong and proper correlate in line 2. The course denoted by Thai has been run; and will be fol- owed by one of a different and unhappy character. The earth dug from the moat had been built up to form a protecting wall; but ft \"\" 7 “ <*» War will * ' le \"“ hilrf ‘ h f * miy addr “ S° od Proclamations to a Ch™r opIe of his capM ’ ^ brings the distress and obstruction to a close,—the great man and fortunate. (But let him say), ‘We may perish! We may perish! ’ (so shall the state of things become firm, as if) bound to a clump of bushy mulberry trees. 6. The sixth line, undivided, shows the overthrow (and removal of) the condition of distress and ob struction. Before this there was that condition. Hereafter there will be joy. XII. The form of Phi, it will be seen, is exactly the opposite of that of Thai. Much of what has been said on the interpretation of that will apply to this, or at least assist the student in making out the meaning of its symbolism. Phi is the hexagram of the seventh month. Genial influences have done their work, the pro cesses of growth are at an end. Henceforth increasing decay must be looked for. Naturally we should expect the advance of the subject of the first of the three weak lines to lead to evil; but if he set himself to be firm and correct, he will bring about a different issue. Patience and obedience are proper for the small man in all circumstances. If the great man in difficulty yet cherish these attributes, he will soon have a happy issue out of the distress. The third line is weak. Its place is odd, and therefore for it incorrect. Its subject would vent his evil purpose, but has not strength to do so. He is left therefore to the shame which he ought to feel without a word of warning. Does the ming of the fourth line mean ( the ordination of Heaven/ as /dfi Hsi thinks; or the orders of the ruler, as AfMng-jze says? Whichever interpre tation be taken (and some critics unite the two), the action of the subject of the line, whose strength is tempered by the even posi tion, will be good and correct, and issue in success and happiness. The strong line in the fifth, (its correct), place, brings the distress and obstruction to a close. Yet its subject—the ruler in the hexa- gram—is warned to continue to be cautious in two lines of rhyme: ‘ And let him say, “ I die 1 I die I ” So to a bushy clump his fortune he shall tie.’ There is an end of the condition of distress. It was necessary that condition should give place to its opposite; and the strong line in the topmost place fitly represents the consequent joy. THE yf KING.",

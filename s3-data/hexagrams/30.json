It is implied, though the Thwan does not say it, that he would get out of the danger. Line i is weak, at the bottom of the figure, and has no correlate above, no helper, that is, beyond itself, All these things render the case of its subject hopeless. He will by his efforts only involve himself more deeply in danger. Line 2 is strong, and in the centre. Its subject is unable, indeed, to escape altogether from the danger; but he does not involve himself more deeply in it like the subject of 1, and obtains some ease. Line 3 is weak, and occupies the place of a strong line. Its subject is in an evil case. Line 4 is weak, and will get no help from its correlate in 1. Its subject is not one who can avert the danger threatening himself and others. But his position is close to that of the ruler in 5, whose intimacy he cultivates with an unostentatious sincerity, sym- bolled by the appointments of the simple feast, and whose intelli gence he cautiously enlightens. In consequence, there will be no error. ^ The subject of line 5 is on the eve of extrication and deliverance, The waters of the defile will ere long have free vent and disappear, and the ground will be levelled and made smooth, The line is strong, in a proper place, and in the place of honour. The case of the subject of line 6 is hopeless. When danger has reached its highest point, there he is, represented by a weak line, and with no proper correlate below. The 1 thicket of thorns' is ta en as a metaphor for a prison; but if the expression has a history, I have been unable to find it. SECT. I. THE Lt HEXAGRAM. 121 Let (its subject) also nourish (a docility like that of) the cow, and there will be good fortune. 1. The first line, undivided, shows one ready to move with confused steps. But he treads at the same time reverently, and there will be no mistake. 2. The second line, divided, shows its subject in his place in yellow. There will be great good fortune. 3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject in a position like that of the declining sun. Instead of playing on his instrument of earthenware, and singing to it, he utters the groans of an old man of eighty. There will be evil. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows the manner of its subject’s coming. How abrupt it is, as with fire, with death, to be rejected (by all)! 5. The fifth line, divided, shows its subject as one with tears flowing in torrents, and groaning in sorrow. There will be good fortune. XXX. Li is the name of the trigram representing fire and light, and the sun as the source of both of these. Its virtue or attribute is brightness, and by a natural metaphor intelligence. But Li has also the meaning of inhering in, or adhering to, being attached to. Both these significations occur in connexion with the hexagram, and make it difficult to determine what was the subject of it in the minds of the authors. If we take the whole figure as expressing the subject, we have, as in the treatise on the T hwan ,' a double bright ness,’ a phrase which is understood to denominate the ruler. If we take the two central lines as indicating the subject, we have weakness, dwelling with strength above and below. In either case theie aie required from the subject a strict adherence to what is correct, and a docile humility. On the second member of the Thwan Khl ng- < ze sa y S The nature of the ox is docile, and that of the cow is much more so. The subject of the hexagram adhering closely to 122 THE Y$ KING. TEXT. 6. The topmost line, undivided, shows the king employing its subject in his punitive expeditions. Achieving admirable (merit), he breaks (only) the chiefs (of the rebels). Where his prisoners were not their associates, he does not punish. There will be no error. what is correct, he must be able to act in obedience to it, as docile as a cow, and then there will be good fortune.’ Line x is strong, and at the bottom of the trigram for lire, the nature of which is to ascend. Its subject therefore will move upwards, and is in danger of doing so coarsely and vehemently. But the lowest line has hardly entered into the action of the figure, and this consideration operates to make him reverently careful of his movements; and there is no error. Line 2 is weak, and occupies the centre. Yellow is one of the five correct colours, and here symbolises the correct course to which the subject of the line adheres. Line 3 is at the top of the lower trigram, whose light may he considered exhausted, and suggests the symbol of the declining sun. The subject of the line should accept the position, ami resign himself to the ordinary amusements which are mentioned, but he groans and mourns instead. His strength interferes with the lowly contentment which he should cherish, The strength of line 4, and its being in an even place, make its subject appear in this unseemly manner, disastrous to himself. Line 5 is in the place of honour, and central. But it is weak, as is its correlate. Its position between the strong 4 and 6 fills its subject with anxiety and apprehension, that express themselves as is described, But such demonstrations are a proof of his inward adherence to right and his humility. There will be good fortune. Line 6, strong and at the top of the figure, has the intelligence denoted by its trigrams in the highest degree, and his own proper vigour. 1 hiough these his achievements are great, but his generous consideration is equally conspicuous, and he falls into no error. sect. n.

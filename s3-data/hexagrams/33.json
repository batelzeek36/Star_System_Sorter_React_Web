    "normalized_summary": "Strategic withdrawal. You pull back to preserve strength, authority, and position rather than wasting force in a losing situation. Retreat done with discipline is not cowardice — it’s wisdom. Chasing, clinging, or retreating in panic invites danger. Calm, dignified withdrawal creates long-term advantage."

    "legge_1899_public_domain": "Am eh intimates that (under its conditions) there will be progress and attainment. (But) if the regu lations (which it prescribes) be severe and difficult, they cannot be permanent. 1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject not the hexagram might be feared; but he discards that regard, and will do nothing to be repented of. There is a change of style in the Chinese text at this point. As Wang Shan-jze (Yuan dynasty) says‘ Here and henceforth the scattering is of what should be scattered, that what should not be scattered may be collected.’ Line 4, though weak, is in its correct place, and adjoins the strong 5, which is in the ruler’s seat. The subject of 4, therefore, will fitly represent the minister, to whom it belongs to do a great part in remedying the evil of dispersion. And this he does. He brings dissentient partizanship to an end; and not satisfied with that, he collects multitudes of those who had been divided into a great body so that they stand out conspicuous like a hill. Line 5 gives us the action of the ruler himself;—by his proclama tions, and by his benevolence. Afft Hsf and other critics enlarge on the symbolism of the perspiration, which they think much to the point. P. Regis avoids it, translating— 1 ' Ille, magnas leges dissipans, facit ut penetrent(ur ?).’ Canon McClatchie has an ingenious and original, so far as my Chinese reading goes, note upon it:— 1 ' As sweat cures fevers, so do proclamations cure rebel lions.’ Both of these translators miss the meaning of the other instance of the king’s work. . ■ < Line 6 is occupied by a strong line, which has a proper correlate in 3 ; but 3 is at the top of the trigram of peril. The subject of 6 hurries away from association with the subject of it, but does so in the spirit of the hexagram, so that there is no error or blame attaching to him. quitting the courtyard outside his door. There will be no error. 2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject not quitting the courtyard inside his gate. There will be evil. 3. The third line, divided, shows its subject with no appearance of observing the (proper) regulations, in which case we shall see him lamenting. But there will be no one to blame (but himself). 4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject quietly and naturally (attentive to all) regulations. There^ will be progress and success. 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject sweetly and acceptably enacting his regulations. There will be good fortune. The onward progress with them will afford ground for admiration. 6. The topmost line, divided, shows its subject enacting regulations severe and difficult. Even with firmness and correctness there will be evil. But though there will be cause for repentance, it will (by and by) disappear. LX. The primary application of the character Zieh was to denote the joints of the bamboo; it is used also for the joints of the human frame; and for the solar and other terms of the year. Whatever makes regular division may be denominated a Wieh; there enter into it the ideas of regulating and restraining; and the subject of this hexagram is the regulations of government enacted for the guidance and control of the people. How the constituent trigrams are supposed to suggest or indicate this meaning will be seen in Appendix II. Wu Hsi anticipates that symbolism in trying to account for the statement that the figure gives the promise of success and attain ment; hut the ground of this is generally made out by referring to the equal division of the undivided and divided lines and our having in 2 and 5, the central places, two undivided lines. An SECT. II. THE AUNG Ftj HEXAGRAM. LX I. The Xung F6 Hexagram. /Tung Fft (moves even) pigs and fish, and leads to good fortune. There will be advantage in cross- important point concerning ‘ regulations’ is brought out in the con clusion of the Th wan,—that they must be adapted to circumstances, and not made too strict and severe. Line 1 is strong, and in its correct place. Its subject therefore would not be wanting in power to make his way. But he is sup posed to be kept in check by the strong 2, and the correlate 4 is the first line in the trigram of peril. The course of wisdom there fore is to keep still. The character here rendered door is that belonging to the inner apartments, leading from the hall into which entrance is found by the outer gate, mentioned under line 2. The courtyard outside the door and that inside the gate is one and the same. The ‘Daily Lecture 1 says that the paragraph tells an officer not to take office rashly, but to exercise a cautious judgment in his measures. Line 2 is strong, in the wrong place; nor has it a proper correlate. Its subject keeps still, when he ought to be up and doing. There will be evil. Line 3 should be strong, but it is weak. It is neither central nor correct. It has no proper correlate, and it is the topmost line in the trigram of complacent satisfaction. Its subject will not receive the yoke of regulations; and he will find out his mistake, when it is too late. Line 4 is weak,,as it ought to be, and its subject has respect to the authority of the strong ruler in 5. Hence its good symbolism and auspice. Line 5 is strong, and in its correct place. Its subject regulates himself, having no correlate; but he is lord of the hexagram, and his influence is everywhere beneficially felt. ing the great stream. There will be advantage in being firm and correct. 1. The first line, undivided, shows its subject resting (in himself). There will be good fortune. If he sought to any other, he would not find rest 2. The second line, undivided, shows its subject (like) the crane crying out in her hidden retirement, and her young ones responding to her. (It is as if it were said), ‘ I have a cup of good spirits/ (and the response were), ‘ I will partake of it with you.’ 3. The third line, divided, shows its subject having met with his mate. Now he beats his drum, and now he leaves off. Now he weeps, and now he sings. 4. The fourth line, divided, shows its subject (like) the moon nearly full, and (like) a horse (in a chariot) whose fellow disappears. There will be no error. 5. The fifth line, undivided, shows its subject perfectly sincere, and linking (others) to him in closest union. There will be no error. 6. The topmost line, undivided, shows its subject in chanticleer (trying to) mount to heaven. Even with firm correctness there will be evil. Line 6 is weak, in its proper place. The subject of the top most line must be supposed to possess an exaggerated desire for enacting regulations. They will be too severe, and the effect will be evil. But as Confucius (Analects 3.3) says, that is not so great a fault as to be easy and remiss. It may be remedied, and cause for repentance will disappear. LXI. Afung Ffl, the name of this hexagram, may be represented in English by ‘ Inmost Sincerity.’ It denotes the highest quality of man, and gives its possessor power so that he prevails with spiritual beings, with other men, and with the lower creatures. It is the THE HSlAo KWO HEXAGRAM. 20T LX II. The HsiAo Kwo Hexagram. Hsido Kwo indicates that (in the circumstances which it implies) there will be progress and attain- subject of the ‘ Doctrine of the Mean’ from the 21st chapter onwards, where Remusat rendered it by‘la perfection,’ c la perfection morale,’ and Intorcetta and his coadjutors by ‘vera solidaque perfectio.’ The lineal figure has suggested to the Chinese com mentators, from the author of the first Appendix, two ideas in it which deserve to be pointed out. There are two divided lines in the centre and two undivided below them and above them. The divided lines in the centre are held to represent the heart or mind free from all pre-occupation, without any consciousness of self; and the undivided lines, on each side of it, in the centre of the con stituent trigrams are held to denote the solidity of the virtue of one so free from selfishness. There is no unreality in it, not a single flaw. The ‘ Daily Lecture ’ at the conclusion of its paraphrase of the Thwan refers to the history of the ancient Shun, and the wonder ful achievements of his virtue. The authors give no instance of the affecting of ‘ pigs and fishes' by sincerity, and say that these names are symbolical of men, the rudest and most unsusceptible of being acted on. The Text says that the man thus gifted with sin cerity will succeed in the most difficult enterprises. Remarkable is the concluding sentence that he must be firm and correct. Here, as elsewhere throughout the Yf, there comes out the practical character which has distinguished the Chinese people and their best teaching all along the line of history. The translation of paragraph 1 is according to the view approved by the Khang-hsi editors. The ordinary view makes the other to whom the subject of line 1 looks or might look to be the subject of 4; but they contend that, excepting in the case of 3 and 6, the force of correlation should be discarded from the study of this THE YI KING, THE HSIAO KWO HEXAGRAM. ment. But it will be advantageous to be firm and correct. (What the name denotes) may be done in small affairs, but not in great affairs. (It is like) the j. notes that come down from a bird on the wingto descend is better than to ascend. There will (in this way) be great good fortune. 1. The first line, divided, suggests (the idea of) a bird flying, (and ascending) till the issue is evil. 2. The second line, divided, shows its subject passing by his grandfather, and meeting with his hexagram; for the virtue of sincerity is all centred in itself, thence derived and thereby powerful. } For paragraph 2, see Appendix III, Section i, 42. It is in rhyme, and I have there rendered it in rhyme. The ‘ young ones of the crane’ are represented by line 1. In the third and fourth sentences we have the symbolism of two men brought together by their sympathy in virtue. The subject of the paragraph is the effect of sincerity. The ' mate ’ of line 3 is 6. The principle of correlation comes in. Sincerity, not left to itself, is influenced from without, and hence come the changes and uncertainty in the state and moods of the subject of the line. Line 4 is weak, and in its correct place. The subject of it has discarded the correlate in 1, and hastens on to the confidence of the ruler in 5, being symbolised as the moon nearly full The other symbol of the horse whose fellow has disappeared has refer ence to the discarding of the subject of 1. Anciently chariots and carriages were drawn by four horses, two outsides and two insides. Lines 1 and 4 were a pair of these; but 1 disappears here from the team, and 4 goes on and joins 5. Line 5 is strong and central, in the ruler’s place. Its subject must be the sage on the throne, whose sincerity will go forth and bind all in union with himself. Line 6 should be divided, but is undivided; and coming after 5, what can the subject of it do? His efforts will be ineffectual, and injurious to himself. He is symbolised by a cock—literally, 'the plumaged voice.’ But a cock is not fitted to fly high, and in attempting to do so will only suffer hurt. grandmother; not attempting anything against his ruler, but meeting him as his minister. There will be no error. 3. The third line, undivided, shows its subject taking no extraordinary precautions against danger; and some in consequence finding opportunity to assail and injure him. There will be evil. 4. The fourth line, undivided, shows its subject falling into no error, but meeting (the exigency of his situation), without exceeding (in his natural course). If he go forward, there will be peril, and he must be cautious. There is no occasion to be using firmness perpetually. 5. The fifth line, divided, (suggests the idea) of dense clouds, but no rain, coming from our borders in the west. It also (shows) the prince shooting his arrow, and taking the bird in a cave. 6. The sixth line, divided, shows its subject not meeting (the exigency of his situation), and ex ceeding (his proper course). (It suggests the idea of) a bird flying far aloft. There will be evil. The case is what is called one of calamity and self- produced injury. LXII. The name Hsiao Kwo is explained both by reference to the lines of the hexagram, and to the meaning of the characters. The explanation from the lines appears immediately on comparing them with those of Ta Kwo, the 28th hexagram. There the first and sixth lines are divided, and between are four undivided lines; here the third and fourth lines are undivided, and outside each of them are two divided lines. The undivided or yang lines are great, the divided or yin lines are called small. In Hsiao Kwo the divided or small lines predominate. But this peculiar structure of the figure could be of no interest to the student, if it were not for the meaning of the name, which is ‘ small excesses’ or ‘ exceed ing in what is small.’ The author, accepted by us as king Wfin, THE Vt KING.",

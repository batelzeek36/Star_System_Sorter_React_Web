    "normalized_summary": "Endurance. Right constancy — holding to correct principle over time — creates stable success. This is not blind stubbornness or clinging. It's living in a way that can last. If you force permanence too fast, or you try to lock in something that isn't true, it turns toxic. If you cultivate steady character and appropriate loyalty, you become structurally reliable, and that reliability can move through the world."

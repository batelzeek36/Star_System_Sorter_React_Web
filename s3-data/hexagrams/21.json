    "normalized_summary": "Biting Through = decisive justice. When something is stuck between people — obstruction, deceit, crime — it must be bitten through, even harshly, so that order can be restored. The hexagram says: apply firm, appropriate correction. When justice is clear and proportional, the system can unite and move forward."

(What the name denotes) may be done in small affairs, but not in great affairs. (It is like) the notes that come down from a bird on the wing;--to descend is better than to ascend. There will (in this way) be great good fortune.",
    "normalized_summary": "Favor small, careful moves over grand gestures. Keep low, humble, and precise; firmness within right measure brings fortune while overreaching invites harm."

  "notes": "This is the individual inspiration channel from **Gate 61 (Inner Truth / Mystery)** in the Head to **Gate 24 (Rationalization / The Return)** in the Ajna. Head 61 delivers a pressure to know — not just facts, but *ultimate* or spiritual truth. Ajna 24 keeps ‘returning’ to that spark until it can be made reasonable. This loop is why it’s called the **Channel of Awareness** or sometimes the **Thinker**: inspiration → return → refine → maybe explain.\n\nBecause it’s individual, the timing is mutative and acoustic — it doesn’t always make sense to others, and it can’t be forced. Forcing it creates the not-self pattern of mental obsession, or trying to answer everyone else’s questions. Correct operation: notice the inner truth that arrives, give it time to return, and speak it only when the concept is actually there.",

  "notes": "20–57 is the Integration channel often called **the Channel of the Brainwave** or **Intuitive Clarity in the Now**. Gate 57 in the Spleen is the highest form of splenic, body-based awareness — it hears/feels what’s correct or dangerous *right now*. Gate 20 in the Throat is the voice of **this moment**. Linked, they produce a person who can **speak instant survival truth** the second it arrives.\n\nThis is not logic, not emotional, not tribal; it is *your* body’s knowing. Because it’s Integration, it’s primarily about **self-survival and correctness**, not about convincing others. In distortion it sounds abrupt or fearful (talking every hunch). In correctness it is surgical, precise, and lifesaving: the right thing said at the right moment.\n\nBest practice: let Strategy & Authority decide **when** to voice the intuition — not every inner ping must be spoken.",

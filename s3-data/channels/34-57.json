  "notes": "34–57 is an Integration channel that fuses **Gate 57** (Spleen – the most acute, in-the-now intuition) with **Gate 34** (Sacral – the strongest, purest motor in the BodyGraph). The result is **instinct-driven power**: the body senses something immediately → the body has the energy to move on it immediately. \n\nBecause it’s Integration, this is not about tribe or collective — it’s about *this form surviving and moving correctly right now.* In high expression it looks graceful, animal-like, even tactical: the person seems to ‘just know’ and ‘just do.’ In low expression it looks jumpy or overactive, because 34 will amplify even fuzzy intuitions.\n\nBest practice: let Strategy & Authority filter which 57 pings get 34’s juice. Not every intuition deserves maximum power.",

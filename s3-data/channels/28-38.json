  "notes": "28–38 is the **Channel of Struggle** in the Individual / Knowing circuit. **Gate 38** in the Root is the *Fighter* — it feels a restless pressure to oppose, to resist, to find something worth pushing against. **Gate 28** in the Spleen is the *Game Player / Fear of Death* — it asks, at a survival level, “Is this actually worth it?” Linked, they produce a person who is at their best when engaged in **meaningful struggle**.\n\nBecause it’s individual, the purpose is self-referenced: the collective may not understand why this is worth fighting for. This channel gives great tenacity when the cause is correct — it can endure, persist, and even face the fear of death. In distortion, the person just fights: authority, systems, loved ones, random problems — because the deeper purpose hasn’t been located yet.\n\nIntegration tip for your dataset: map this channel to existential/heroic archetypes and to ‘purpose-seeking’ UX flows, and tag both gates with their classic fears: 38 → fear of a life without purpose; 28 → fear of death / meaninglessness.",

  "notes": "The 44–26 is the classic **Channel of Surrender** in the Tribal Ego/Spleen circuitry. **Gate 44** in the Spleen is *Coming to Meet* — it recognizes patterns, smells, and people from the past, and it knows what the tribe has already seen. **Gate 26** in the Ego/Heart is *The Egoist* — the will to package, promote, and remember only what truly serves. Together they form the ‘sales’ or ‘transmission’ channel of the tribe: *I know what works (44) and I can get it across (26).* \n\nAt its highest, this channel is impeccably honest: it only sells what is correct for the tribe, it only promises what the Heart can keep, and it preserves the tribal record. At its lowest, it becomes slick: exaggeration, selective memory, or using pattern-recognition to push people.\n\nBecause it’s tribal, it’s relational — credibility matters. When 26 has rested (remember: Ego is a small motor), this channel can teach, sell, and persuade brilliantly; when the Ego is tired, promises will break.",

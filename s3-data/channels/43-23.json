  "notes": "43–23 is the classic **Channel of Structuring** in the Individual / Knowing circuit. **Gate 43** in the Ajna receives sudden, acoustic-style insights that do not come from step-by-step logic. They just *arrive*. **Gate 23** in the Throat is the piece that makes that strangeness speakable — it structures the knowing into a form the collective can actually take in. That’s why this channel is the famous ‘freak → genius’ path: if the timing, audience, and mood are wrong, it’s just weird; if they’re right, it’s pure genius.\n\nBecause it’s individual, it’s mutative and pulse-based — you can’t force insights to arrive, and you can’t talk them before they are ready. Correct operation: stay open → receive the knowing → wait for the right moment / recognition → express it simply. Distortion: talking all the time, defending the insight, or dumbing it down to get approval.",

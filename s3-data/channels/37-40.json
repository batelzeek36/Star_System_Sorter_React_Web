  "notes": "37–40 is the classic **Channel of Community** in the Tribal Defense circuit. **Gate 37** in the Solar Plexus brings emotional warmth, touch, friendliness, and the desire for a fair, human deal. **Gate 40** in the Ego/Heart brings the will to work, to provide, to go off alone and ‘do the job’ for the tribe. Together they form the **bargain of belonging**: *I will work for you / protect us (40) if I am fed, touched, included, and treated fairly (37).* \n\nBecause 37 is emotional, this channel should **wait for emotional clarity** before making or changing agreements. When clean, it creates the healthiest form of tribe/family/community — everyone knows the terms and everyone is cared for. When distorted, it becomes the classic tribal guilt pattern: “Look at everything I did for you,” or, from 37’s side, “If you loved me, you’d do X.” \n\nUse it in your dataset anywhere you need to model **mutual obligation, hospitality, clan membership, and emotional economics.**",

  "notes": "29–46 is the **Channel of Discovery** in the Collective Abstract circuit. **Gate 29** in the Sacral is the ‘Yes’ — persistent, enduring, ready to keep going through the whole experience. **Gate 46** in the G/Identity is the ‘Right Place, Right Time’ love of the body. Together they create a person whose life opens up when they **commit with their sacral** *and* find themselves in the correct place.\n\nThis channel learns through lived experience. It doesn’t need a perfect plan — it needs a correct yes and an embodied environment. When aligned, it produces the classic abstract-circuit magic: ‘I said yes, I showed up, and something beautiful/unexpected was discovered.’ When misaligned, 29 says yes to the wrong things and 46 can’t make the place lucky.\n\nKey pattern: never force a 29–46 to commit from the mind. Let the Sacral go ‘uh-huh,’ and then let the body/placement of 46 work the serendipity.",

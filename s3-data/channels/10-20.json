  "notes": "Channel 10–20 links the G/Identity center’s **Behavior of the Self** (Gate 10) with the Throat’s **expression in the present** (Gate 20). In classic Human Design this is called the **Channel of Awakening**. It is deeply individual and does **not** promise to be consistent for others — it simply expresses correct behavior when the moment is right.\n\n• Gate 10 (G): ‘This is how I behave when I love myself.’\n• Gate 20 (Throat): ‘This is what is here **now**.’\nJoined, they create a person who can *demonstrate awake, self-loving behavior in real time.*\n\nHealthy expression: silent until the moment is correct → then a perfectly authentic action/statement. Distortion: talking about being authentic instead of **being** authentic; performing ‘woke’ identity to get attention from an open Throat audience.\n\nBecause it’s Integration, the core logic is **“I survive by being me, right now.”** It’s not tribal (it doesn’t bargain) and not collective (it doesn’t universalize).",

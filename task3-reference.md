Yep — we're officially in Task 3 now 🔓

Task 3 is where we stop just describing archetypes and start generating actual numeric mappings from Human Design gate.lines → star systems. I'll lay out exactly what you need to build in this step so you can implement it and write the drafts into `star-mapping-drafts/`.

I'm going to assume the following are already true based on where we are:

* we have all 8 star system baselines at `lore-research/research-outputs/star-systems/v4.2/`
* each of those baselines now has a `mapping_digest` with `core_themes`, `shadow_themes`, `quick_rules`, and `notes_for_alignment` (Orion-Dark, Orion-Light, Draco, Lyra, Arcturus, Andromeda, Pleiades, Sirius)
* we have the 7 gate-line batch files in `gate-line-API-call/` (gate-line-1.json … gate-line-7.json)

Now we define how Task 3 works.

## 3.0 Directory + output shape

**Input dirs:**

* `lore-research/research-outputs/star-systems/v4.2/`

  * `andromeda-baseline-4.2.json`
  * `arcturus-baseline-4.2.json`
  * `draco-baseline-4.2.json`
  * `lyra-baseline-4.2.json`
  * `orion-dark-baseline-4.2.json`
  * `orion-light-baseline-4.2.json`
  * `pleiades-baseline-4.2.json`
  * `sirius-baseline-4.2.json`

* `lore-research/research-outputs/gate-line-API-call/`

  * `gate-line-1.json`
  * …
  * `gate-line-7.json`

**Output dir (new):**

* `lore-research/research-outputs/star-mapping-drafts/`

You will generate 56 files total:

* 8 systems × 7 batches
* filenames like:
  `andromeda-batch1.json`, `andromeda-batch2.json`, …, `draco-batch7.json`, etc.

Each file is one flat JSON object keyed by `"gate.line"` (e.g. `"19.1"`, `"44.4"`).
Each value is an object with:

```json
{
  "weight": 0.8,
  "alignment_type": "core",
  "why": "Predator scanning and loyalty enforcement match Draco survival-through-dominance."
}
```

No trailing commas. All weights numeric.

---

## 3.1 What the input gate-line data needs to look like

Each gate line in e.g. `gate-line-1.json` should be something like:

```json
{
  "19.1": {
    "behavioral_axis": "hypersensitivity to need and fear of disconnection",
    "shadow_axis": "panic about being abandoned by the tribe; will do anything to keep bond",
    "keywords": ["need", "bonding", "caretaking", "proximity", "please don't leave"]
  },
  "44.4": {
    "behavioral_axis": "pattern recognition of threat and scanning for who belongs",
    "shadow_axis": "gatekeeping, manipulation via loyalty debt",
    "keywords": ["predator scan", "loyalty test", "access control", "who's a threat"]
  }
}
```

Your actual gate-line-*.json might have slightly different field names, but we’ll assume you at least have:

* a short positive/intent description (behavioral/gift)
* a distorted expression (shadow)
* some keywords

Those are the only things Task 3 cares about. We are NOT pulling cosmology or myth here, just behavior style.

---

## 3.2 How to classify one gate.line for one star system

For each `[gate.line, data]` and for each star system, we do:

1. **Match against core themes**
   Take `system.mapping_digest.core_themes`.
   Check if `gate.behavioral_axis` OR `gate.keywords` semantically overlaps those themes.

   Examples:

   * Pleiades core: “caretaking, feeding, nervous system soothing”
   * Draco core: “predator scanning, loyalty enforcement, territorial survival”
   * Andromeda core: “free the captive, stop domination, restore sovereignty”
   * Arcturus core: “frequency calibration, energetic repair, trauma field clearing”
   * Lyra core: “artistic enchantment, immortalization through creative power”
   * Orion-Light core: “spiritual/warrior initiation, proving yourself through ordeal under a higher code”
   * Orion-Dark core: “coercive empire management, obedience systems, psychological pressure at scale”
   * Sirius core: “sacred law of liberation, initiation through ordeal that teaches freedom / cosmic justice”

   If it lines up strongly, that’s a candidate `"alignment_type": "core"`.

2. **Match against shadow themes**
   Take `system.mapping_digest.shadow_themes`.
   Check `gate.shadow_axis` OR the darker side of its `keywords`.

   Examples:

   * Draco shadow: “paranoid control, coercive obedience, ruthless elimination of threats”
   * Pleiades shadow: “caretaking panic, codependent rescue, emotional fusion to avoid abandonment”
   * Andromeda shadow: “martyr fantasy, passive victimhood, waiting for rescue instead of acting”
   * Arcturus shadow: “bypass through ‘high vibration’, spiritual elitism, disembodied detachment”
   * Orion-Dark shadow: literally just Orion-Dark core, because Orion-Dark is already dark by design: empire, enslavement, mind control. (So Orion-Dark “core” is dark. You’ll still label that `"alignment_type": "core"` — because for Orion-Dark the ‘gift’ IS hierarchical domination. That’s by design.)
   * Orion-Light shadow: “status through ordeal at any cost,” self-righteous crusader energy with no compassion.
   * Lyra shadow: “aesthetic elitism, beauty-as-superiority, identity built on grief/artistic martyrdom.”
   * Sirius shadow: “judgmental moral absolutism under ‘liberation’ language.”

   If it lines up there, candidate `"alignment_type": "shadow"`.

3. **Apply `quick_rules` to reject false matches**

   Every system digest already has `quick_rules` that sound like:

   * Draco: “If it's emotional co-regulation and caretaking panic, that’s Pleiades, not Draco.”
   * Andromeda: “If it's nervous system soothing or feeding, that’s Pleiades, not Andromeda.”
   * Arcturus: “If it's predator scanning / loyalty enforcement, that's Draco, not Arcturus.”
   * Pleiades (not shown in convo, but should say): “If it’s ruthless threat-scanning and access control, that’s Draco, not Pleiades.”
   * Orion-Dark: “This is empire-scale control, not tribal survival (that’s Draco), not nurturing (Pleiades), not spiritual ordeal (Sirius/Orion-Light).”
   * Andromeda (your updated version): “If it’s post-rescue trauma calibration, that’s Arcturus, not Andromeda,” etc.

   You MUST run those rules before you finalize weight.

   Example:

   * Gate line says: “I will watch every newcomer and test their loyalty to protect the tribe.”
     Draco core screams “yes.”
     Pleiades would try to claim “protect loved ones,” but Pleiades quick_rules says “caretaking and co-regulation, not threat scanning,” so Pleiades gets kicked out.

   * Gate line says: “I soothe, feed, and stabilize partners so nobody feels abandoned.”
     Pleiades core screams “yes.”
     Draco quick_rules says “Draco is survival-through-dominance, not emotional nurturing,” so Draco gets kicked out.

   * Gate line says: “I break cages, I intervene when someone is being controlled.”
     That fits Andromeda core.
     Arcturus quick_rules says “Arcturus is healing and recalibration, not liberation strike teams,” so Arcturus is excluded unless the line explicitly says “I clean/repair trauma fields after.”

   * Gate line says: “I ascend rank by surviving brutal tests because that's the code.”
     Orion-Light core.
     Orion-Dark quick_rules says “I enforce planetary-scale obedience and empire,” which does NOT match here, so Orion-Dark is excluded.

   * Gate line says: “I weaponize obedience systems and psychological pressure at scale.”
     Orion-Dark core, full send.
     Draco quick_rules: Draco is tribal and immediate, not empire-scale. Draco is excluded.

4. **Pick alignment_type**
   After quick_rules filtering:

   * If the win came from a `core_themes` match → `"core"`.
   * If the win came from a `shadow_themes` match → `"shadow"`.
   * If neither survive filtering → `"none"` and `weight` = 0.0.

   Special note:

   * Orion-Dark’s “core” is still domination/control. That’s fine. Call it `"core"` because that IS Orion-Dark’s authentic pattern.
   * If a gate.line hits both core of System A and shadow of System B, we keep both in the per-batch draft. We don't resolve that here; resolution happens in step 4 when we merge across systems and sort by weight.

---

## 3.3 Weighting logic (0.0–1.0)

We don't need machine learning here. We just need deterministic heuristics so it's reproducible.

Here’s a straight scoring recipe you can implement:

1. Initialize `score_core = 0`, `score_shadow = 0`.

2. For each phrase in `system.mapping_digest.core_themes`:

   * If that phrase (or close synonym) appears in `gate.behavioral_axis` OR in `gate.keywords`, add +0.25 to `score_core`.

3. For each phrase in `system.mapping_digest.shadow_themes`:

   * If that phrase (or close synonym) appears in `gate.shadow_axis` OR in `gate.keywords`, add +0.25 to `score_shadow`.

4. Clamp:

   * If `score_core > 1.0`, set to 1.0.
   * If `score_shadow > 1.0`, set to 1.0.

5. Decide which score to use:

   * If `score_core >= score_shadow` and score_core > 0:

     * candidate_weight = score_core
     * candidate_alignment_type = "core"
   * Else if `score_shadow > score_core`:

     * candidate_weight = score_shadow
     * candidate_alignment_type = "shadow"
   * Else:

     * candidate_weight = 0
     * candidate_alignment_type = "none"

6. Apply `quick_rules` kill-switches:

   * If quick_rules say “this is actually Pleiades, not Draco,” then set Draco’s candidate_weight = 0 and Draco alignment_type = "none" even if Draco scored above.
   * If quick_rules say “this is actually Andromeda, not Arcturus,” then kill Arcturus, etc.

7. After kill-switch:

   * Round candidate_weight to two decimal places so we're stable but still graded.

     * `>= 0.75` feels like “this is canonically that system's vibe,” usually shows up as 0.8–1.0.
     * `0.4–0.6` feels shadow.
     * `0.2–0.3` is ‘weak echo / secondary influence,’ which is allowed because final merge (Task 4) sorts and lower weights just fall to the bottom.

8. Final:

   * `weight = candidate_weight`
   * `alignment_type = candidate_alignment_type`
   * `why = one-sentence behavioral rationale (see below)`

If candidate_weight ended up 0 after kill-switch, you still output that gate.line in the draft file?
Answer: yes. You MUST include every gate.line in every system’s per-batch file. That’s important because Task 4 reads them all expecting same coverage.
If weight == 0, then:

```json
"alignment_type": "none",
"why": "No behavioral match to Draco themes; this gate focuses on nurturing/safety not survival-through-dominance."
```

---

## 3.4 Writing the `"why"`

Rules for `"why"`:

* One sentence.
* Behavioral, not lore.
* Say what the gate.line is doing.
* Say why that is (or is not) this star system's lane.

Good examples:

**Pleiades core example (Gate 19.1 style):**

```json
"why": "It fixates on keeping bonds intact by soothing need and preventing abandonment, which is classic Pleiadian nervous-system caretaking."
```

**Draco core example (Gate 44.4 style):**

```json
"why": "It constantly scans for threats and enforces loyalty boundaries to protect the group, which maps to Draco predator-survival behavior."
```

**Andromeda core example:**

```json
"why": "It intervenes to stop domination and restore someone's sovereignty, which matches Andromeda's liberation/anti-captivity role."
```

**Arcturus core example:**

```json
"why": "It describes calibrating and repairing energetic distortion so the system can stabilize, which matches Arcturian frequency-healing."
```

**Orion-Dark core example:**

```json
"why": "It organizes obedience structures and uses psychological pressure to enforce hierarchy, which is Orion-Dark empire management."
```

**Orion-Light core example:**

```json
"why": "It frames advancement as surviving honorable ordeal in service to a higher code, which is Orion-Light warrior initiation."
```

**Sirius core example:**

```json
"why": "It treats crisis as a rite that reveals sacred law and personal sovereignty, which aligns to Sirius' liberation-through-initiation pattern."
```

**Lyra core example:**

```json
"why": "It centers on creative charisma and immortalizing meaning through expression, which is Lyra's artistic enchantment lane."
```

Edge / shadow case:

**Andromeda shadow example:**

```json
"why": "It waits passively to be rescued and leans into martyr identity instead of reclaiming sovereignty, which is Andromeda shadow."
```

If weight is 0:

```json
"why": "This is emotional co-regulation and feeding/safety, which belongs to Pleiades, not Draco's threat-scanning survival stance."
```

## 3.5 Pseudocode for Task 3 loop

This is basically what your script should do:

```python
SYSTEMS = [
  "andromeda",
  "arcturus",
  "draco",
  "lyra",
  "orion-dark",
  "orion-light",
  "pleiades",
  "sirius"
]

for system in SYSTEMS:
    digest = load_mapping_digest(
        f"lore-research/research-outputs/star-systems/v4.2/{system}-baseline-4.2.json"
    )

    for batch_i in range(1, 8):  # 1..7
        gates = load_json(
            f"lore-research/research-outputs/gate-line-API-call/gate-line-{batch_i}.json"
        )

        out = {}

        for gate_id, gate_data in gates.items():

            # 1. score core vs shadow
            score_core = semantic_overlap(gate_data.behavioral_axis,
                                          gate_data.keywords,
                                          digest.core_themes)

            score_shadow = semantic_overlap(gate_data.shadow_axis,
                                            gate_data.keywords,
                                            digest.shadow_themes)

            # 2. pick candidate
            if score_core >= score_shadow and score_core > 0:
                candidate_weight = score_core
                candidate_alignment_type = "core"
                source_bucket = "core"
            elif score_shadow > score_core:
                candidate_weight = score_shadow
                candidate_alignment_type = "shadow"
                source_bucket = "shadow"
            else:
                candidate_weight = 0.0
                candidate_alignment_type = "none"
                source_bucket = "none"

            # 3. apply quick_rules kill-switch
            if violates_quick_rules(
                gate_data,
                digest.quick_rules,
                system
            ):
                candidate_weight = 0.0
                candidate_alignment_type = "none"
                source_bucket = "none"

            candidate_weight = round(candidate_weight, 2)

            # 4. build why sentence
            why_text = build_why(
                gate_data,
                system,
                candidate_alignment_type,
                digest
            )

            out[gate_id] = {
                "weight": candidate_weight,
                "alignment_type": candidate_alignment_type,
                "why": why_text
            }

        save_json(
            f"lore-research/research-outputs/star-mapping-drafts/{system}-batch{batch_i}.json",
            out
        )
```

Where:

* `semantic_overlap(...)` is literally “count matched theme phrases / 4” or whatever normalization gives you 0–1.
* `violates_quick_rules(...)` = look at the system’s `quick_rules` list and check for any explicit ‘not X, that’s actually Y’ redirections that apply to this gate. If yes, kill weight.
* `build_why(...)` uses pattern templates like the examples in 3.4.

The whole point of per-batch output is: by the time you finish Task 3, you’ll have a draft label for every gate.line, for every system, for every batch, even if the label is `"none"` and weight `0.0`.

---

## 3.6 Deliverables for Task 3

When Task 3 is “done,” you should have:

* New folder:

  * `lore-research/research-outputs/star-mapping-drafts/`

* Inside it, 56 files:

  * `andromeda-batch1.json`
  * …
  * `andromeda-batch7.json`
  * `arcturus-batch1.json`
  * …
  * `sirius-batch7.json`

* Each file:

  * Must include **every** gate.line from that batch (so coverage stays 1:1 with the batch input file).
  * Must have valid JSON. No trailing commas.
  * Must have numeric weights between 0 and 1.
  * Must have `"alignment_type"` in `"core" | "shadow" | "none"`.
  * Must have a `"why"` one-liner as described.

After that, Task 4 will merge them into `gateLine_star_map.json` and sort/clean.

---

## 3.7 Updated STATUS

Here's the pipeline status block with where we stand right now:

* mapping_digest injected into all star systems: ✔
* per-batch mapping drafts (8×7 = 56 files) generated: ✘
* gateLine_star_map.json created with _meta: ✘
* QC coverage / consistency / sanity complete: ✘
* Ready for runtime use in S³ app: ✘
* Timestamp (UTC): [to be filled on merge in Task 4]
* Source star system baseline version: 4.2

---

Next immediate action:

* Implement the classifier logic above.
* Run it across all 7 gate-line batches for all 8 systems.
* Emit the 56 draft JSON files into `star-mapping-drafts/`.

That completes Task 3 and unblocks Task 4.
